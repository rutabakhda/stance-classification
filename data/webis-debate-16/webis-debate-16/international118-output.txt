Non-Argumentative	on the first of julythe rome statute that formed the international criminal court (icc) came into force.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc was needed to try the most serious war crimes and crimes against humanity when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves but this inevitably means there will be conflicts between the individual sovereignty of nations, and a court that wishes to try their nationals outside of their domestic justice system.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc as an independent international organisation, outside of the united nations system running on funding from state parties is able to conduct its own investigations, but still needs cooperation from the states parties for the arrest of those who violate international criminal law.
Non-Argumentative	 in order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the icc needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the united nations security council (being made up by the us, france, russia, china and the uk), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves.
Non-Argumentative	in the case of uhuru kenyatta kenya referred the case to the icc itself.
Non-Argumentative	 the case was the result of violence after disputed elections inwhich pitted the kikuyu ethnic group’s party the party of national unity lead by mwai kibabi against the orange democratic movement mostly made up of kalenjins and luos with raila odinga as their candidate.
Non-Argumentative	 odinga’s party believed they had been cheated of the election leading to protest, and violence; an estimatedwere killed and 600,000 fled their homes.
Non-Argumentative	 those accused of instigating the violence are uhuru kenyatta on the pnu side and william ruto and joshua sang for the odm.
Non-Argumentative	 kenya conducted an investigation, the waki commission, but the kenyan parliament refused to act on its advice to create a special tribunal so the information from the commission was passed to the icc in july 2009.
Non-Argumentative	 with this information the icc prosecutor invoked proprio motu powers to launch an investigation without a prior request from the unsc or kenya.
Non-Argumentative	 charges for crimes against humanity against kenyatta, ruto, sang and one other, francis muthaura, were confirmed on 8th march 2011.
Non-Argumentative	politically however the situation is difficult for the icc.
Non-Argumentative	 despite having been on opposite sides inin the next elections inkenyatta and ruto had put their differences behind them to form a coalition.
Non-Argumentative	 this coalition won theelections, though by a close margin and not without dispute, making kenyatta the fourth president of kenya and ruto his deputy.
Non-Argumentative	 ruto’s trial has already begun, though it was interrupted by the attack on the westgate shopping center.
Non-Argumentative	 kenyatta’s trial is set to take place inthough it is being delayed.
Non-Argumentative	 both ruto and kenyatta have stated they are willing to cooperate but have criticized the court calling it “a painfully farcical pantomime” and a “toy of declining imperial powers” while the african union has called for immunity for all sitting leaders, and for the indictment of kenyatta to be dropped.
Argumentative	  uhuru kenyatta is a sitting president of a democratic nation .
Argumentative	 this means that he was elected by the people to serve them .
Argumentative	 by indicting a sitting leader , you undermine their ability to rule the country as they will be forced to spend long periods outside their country focusing on something that is irrelevant to the governance of their country .
Argumentative	 the icc has demanded that kenyatta and ruto attend the trial in person .
Argumentative	 by forcing the president and deputy president to spend long hours away from the country involved in a trial the icc is effectively disenfranchising the people who voted from him to be their leader .
Argumentative	 further , kenyatta is first and foremost accountable to the kenyan people , who have chosen him as leader despite these claims .
Argumentative	 it is clearly unwelcome interference by the icc for the court to take the president away from his duties .
Argumentative	 while kenyatta and his deputy william ruto have been visiting the icc , they should have been leading their countries .
Argumentative	 while the indictment has occurred both have remained the leaders of their countries , but have been absent while major events such as the westgate shootings occurred .
Argumentative	 despite the need to strong leadership in the midst of a potentially divisive event , ruto was only granted one week away from trial .
Argumentative	 having a clear and stable leadership is important for kenya to develop , restrict violence and ensure that policy development is able to continue , particularly given the cross-ethnic powering sharing arrangement between kenyatta and ruto .
Argumentative	 absence of leadership during the fear and uncertainty surrounding this event might lead to a fresh round of violence as supporters take to the streets in protest -- this election had put former enemies kenyatta and ruto together , easing ethnic tensions in the region .
Argumentative	 kenya has a functioning judiciary and police force .
Argumentative	 they have successfully prosecuted some individuals for these crimes and it should be left to kenya to deliver justice for itself .
Argumentative	 there have been several cases brought before the courts .
Argumentative	 kenyans overwhelmingly see the icc is ` imperialist ' , and% want the icc to terminate its case against kenyatta .
Argumentative	 if and when kenya 's leaders should be tried should be left to the domestic judiciary to decide .
Argumentative	 while the icc feels free to interfere with african countries it would never dare to do so in a western country ; leaders such as george bush , tony blair , nicholas sarkozy and others who have launched various armed interventions have not been put on trial .
Argumentative	 not only is it victimization and interference the trial of kenyatta is also likely to be pointless ; it is on the point of collapse .
Argumentative	 the prosecutor fatou bensouda has stated `` having carefully considered my evidence and the impact of the two withdrawals , i have come to the conclusion that currently the case against mr. kenyatta does not satisfy the high evidentiary standards required at trial '' .
