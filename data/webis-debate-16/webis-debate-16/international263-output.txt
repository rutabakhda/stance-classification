Non-Argumentative	self-determination is loosely defined as the right of nations or peoples to "freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development"1.
Non-Argumentative	 it is common to hear the assertion that this is a "fundamental human right".
Non-Argumentative	 but what exactly does this mean, and is it correct?
Non-Argumentative	self-determination is an issue in many different contexts around the world.
Non-Argumentative	 many of these involve states which have, through territorial expansion, population shifts, boundary changes, independence from or colonisation of other nations, found themselves in charge of minority groups who may have strong ethnic, national, religious, cultural or linguistic differences from other inhabitants of a nation.
Non-Argumentative	 this can lead to all sorts of problems; minorities may identify more strongly with a neighbouring state, or fear that their cultural and political identity is being diluted by state policies, while nation states are often concerned about instability or loss of their strong national identity if minority groups are given too much autonomy or special treatment.
Argumentative	so, on balance, is self-determination a universal right that should be available to all peoples, or is it an idea whose time has passed?
Argumentative	many states in the modern world do not respect the rights of minorities or actively seek to dilute and subsume them into the majority culture .
Argumentative	 others offer limited protections to minority peoples but stop short of allowing them to choose their own futures .
Argumentative	 we need to reassert their right to self-determination to ensure that these minority cultures are not lost .
Argumentative	 failure to defend the principle of self-determination now will effectively close off the choices of future generations .
Argumentative	 for example , australian government policy for many decades was to ignore aboriginal rights , denying them full citizenship1 and removing children from their homes and relocating them with white families , the so-called `` stolen generation ``.
Argumentative	 as a result many indigenous australians no longer have a strong link to their native cultures and languages .
Argumentative	 the same is arguably true in places like tibet , where traditional culture is being diluted over time through the deliberate policy of the chinese government .
Argumentative	 in some contexts , separation may not be a realistic option for minority peoples .
Argumentative	 however , that does not mean that self-determination is not meaningful for such groups .
Argumentative	 for indigenous peoples , self-determination may take the form of restitution for land that was stolen from them , or compensation and reparations .
Argumentative	 furthermore , self-determination may take the form of political autonomy , or greater rights to decide how children are educated , or parallel systems of justice such as sharia courts .
Argumentative	 self-determination is about representation and identity and choice - not about outcomes .
Argumentative	 many modern nation states are the product of historical accident or hurried decolonisation processes that did not properly take account of ethnic or religious differences between peoples in the states that resulted .
Argumentative	 examples can be seen all over the world but especially in asia , africa and the former soviet union , where postcolonial or post-cold war boundaries separate people from their kin against their wills .
Argumentative	 other territories may be disputed between one or more nation .
Argumentative	 allowing ethnic or religious groups self-determination may help to reverse the harmful effect of artificial , poorly-drawn borders .
Argumentative	 if self-determination is universally accepted , and applied , by the international community as a key principle in such disputes , they may in future be easier to resolve .
Argumentative	 two examples ; kashmir , which straddles the line of partition drawn up by the british when granting independence to india and pakistan in; and the falkland islands , which are the object of dispute between the uk and argentina , including a brief war in.
Argumentative	 history , law geography all offer competing and incompatible views of who should rightfully own these territories .
Argumentative	 if we recognise the principle of self-determination as key , however , it is clear that it is the view of the inhabitants that should decide its future .
Argumentative	 indeed , if this principle is ignored , such disputes will rumble on for many years to come .
Argumentative	 modern liberal democracy is founded on the idea that people should be free to decide their own leaders and their own futures , but not all states give their minority peoples such a right .
Argumentative	 however , this is a right guaranteed under international law .
Argumentative	 the international court of justice has held that this right applies not just to national governments but also people1 .
Argumentative	 the two important united nations studies on the right to self-determination set out factors of a people that give rise to possession of right to self-determination : a history of independence or self-rule in an identifiable territory , a distinct culture , and a will and capability to regain self-governance2 .
Argumentative	 if these criteria are in place , such peoples should have the right to determine their own constitutional and political arrangements .
