Non-Argumentative	bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of spain, portugal, southern france and some latin american countries (mexico, colombia, venezuela, peru and ecuador), in which one or more bulls are baited and usually killed by a matador in a bullring for sport and entertainment.
Non-Argumentative	 it is often called a blood sport by its detractors but followers of the spectacle regard it as a fine art and not a sport as there are no elements of competition in the proceedings.
Non-Argumentative	 bullfighting is banned in most countries, and has been banned more recently in some countries and regions with long histories and traditions with the event.
Non-Argumentative	 most notably, bullfighting was banned inin the spanish region of catalonia and its largest city barcelona, where it has a centuries long history and attracted international fame.
Non-Argumentative	 at the same time, places like madrid have responded to such actions by officially preserving bullfighting as an art form.
Non-Argumentative	 this means that anti-bullfighting activists can be charged with a crime and a substantial fine for disrupting the patrimony of bullfighting and spanish culture.
Argumentative	 these historic actions have re-enlivened the debate about bullfighting in spain and around the world.
Argumentative	bullfighting constitutes animal torture because it is exactly the suffering of the animal from which the entertainment of the crowd is drawn , and the level of suffering inflicted is on the level of that caused by torture .
Argumentative	 jeremy bentham argued that `` cock-fights and bull-fights , the chase of the hare and the fox , fishing , and other amusements of the same kind , necessarily suppose a want of reflection or a want of humanity ; since these sports inflict upon sensitive beings the most lively sufferings , and the most lingering and painful death that can be imagined . ''
Argumentative	  the want of humanity even in modern bullfighting is shown by the sadistic cruelties inflicted on the bulls : according to anti-bullfight veterinarian josé zaldívar , in the great majority of cases , the matador missed the vital spot that would cause the bull to die quickly .
Argumentative	 `` these provoke internal bleeding .
Argumentative	 it is a slow , agonising death -- as the high acidity of their blood proves . ''
Argumentative	  at the end of the fight , the bull may not be yet dead while his body parts are cut-off to be kept as trophies .
Argumentative	 spanish bull breeders receive eu agricultural subsidies , meaning that , in the eu , taxpayers ' money from all countries , not just those with legal bullfighting , goes to support this terrible industry .
Argumentative	  also , in order to reduce the risk to the matador , sometimes the bull 's horns are shaved .
Argumentative	 this can inflict some pain on the bull and can also make it more sensitive to other forms of pain during the fight .
Argumentative	  moreover , bulls are not the only creatures to suffer in bullrings .
Argumentative	 the tormented bull does not understand that it is the man on the horse 's back that is causing his pain , only that he is in agony .
Argumentative	 he therefore sees the horse as his enemy as much as the man .
Argumentative	 it 's not unusual for horses used in bullfights to be so badly gored by the bulls that they have to be killed , but only after they have been dragged from the ring and the view of the spectators .
Argumentative	  all this suffering makes bullfighting as unacceptable as the many other kinds of animal cruelty which most countries ban , such as cockfighting , dogfighting or any other form of grievous harm inflicted on an animal for ` entertainment ' purposes .
Argumentative	  we have these laws because governments have generally acknowledged the truth of bentham 's words : `` it does n't matter if they can reason ; it does n't matter if they can speak ; what does matter is if they can suffer . ''
Argumentative	  all nations need to follow through on this principle by making bullfighting illegal , just like any other form of animal torture .
Argumentative	 if a creature suffers then there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration .
Argumentative	 all animals are sentient beings that experience joy , happiness , fear and pain , in the same way that human beings do .
Argumentative	 as bentham previously noted , it does not matter that they can not express this suffering in the same way as humans can , by speaking about it , or reason about their suffering in the same way - the important thing is that they can suffer in the first place .
Argumentative	 we can have no right whatsoever to make them suffer for our ` enjoyment ' .
Argumentative	 if any torture inflicted to an animal deserves condemnation , bullfights are the worst kind of torture since they are performed solely in the name of entertainment .
Argumentative	 we must end the animals ' torture and stop these shows of brutality and violence .
Argumentative	 it is too small a step from the intentional infliction of pain on an animal to the torture and killing of human beings .
Argumentative	  bullfights perpetuate the idea that injuring and killing an animal for amusement is acceptable , and that is not an idea which any state with any concern for animals , or for its human citizens , should wish to be prevalent .
Argumentative	 part of the ` attraction ' of bullfighting for crowds is witnessing death .
Argumentative	 advocates of the practice make this into an argument for the practice .
Argumentative	 but , a desire to see death in front of one 's own eye 's amounts to bloodlust .
Argumentative	 why should humans be accommodated in such a morbid pursuit ?
Argumentative	 eric gallego , an animal rights protester , said in: `` bullfighting is a bloody entertainment .
Argumentative	 we must stop this cruelty because we do n't want to be a barbaric society in europe . ''
Argumentative	  this argument applies just as much to any other country in the world : why would we want to encourage people to enjoy pain and suffering , as we have laws which make causing pain and suffering illegal , both for humans and animals , in almost every other context ?
Argumentative	 bullfighting is therefore immoral , and encourages cruel and immoral behaviour in other areas , and so it should be banned .
Argumentative	 many matadors are gored each year .
Argumentative	 in, famed matador julio aparicio was gored in the throat by a bull during the festival of saint isidro .
Argumentative	 the bulls horn went through his neck and throat and up through his mouth .
Argumentative	 such gruesome scenes , and the risks that matadors must take with their lives , have no place in a modern society .
Argumentative	  the culture and audience pressure of bullfighting actually increase the danger for matadors .
Argumentative	 the bullfighters perceived and praised as ` the best ' are the ones that come closest to the bull , letting its horns pass inches by the fighter 's side , etc, the greater the risk for the bullfighter , the greater the reward from the crowd .
Argumentative	 the bullfighter is not trying to stay as far away as possible in order to make a riskless kill ; they are trying to demonstrate their courage and bravery in the face of potentially fatal risks .
Argumentative	  in spain and most other countries with bullfighting , the horns of bulls are not shaved , but rather kept sharp , increasing the danger for the matador .
Argumentative	  the state bans many other kinds of activities on the grounds that they are harmful to the participants : taking narcotics is illegal , driving without a seatbelt is illegal , and in many countries even legal guns are required to be fitted with safety devices to protect the user .
Argumentative	 this is yet another instance where , if the state did not step in , individuals would enter into certain activities which would be harmful to them .
Argumentative	 the need for the state is especially keen here due to the pressure to take risks put on matadors and others by the audience and the bullfighting community , which may lead many of them to take risks , and suffer injuries , they otherwise would not , for fear of losing ` face ' .
Argumentative	 bullfighting is just too dangerous to humans to allow , and so the state should step in and ban bullfighting to protect all those involved .
