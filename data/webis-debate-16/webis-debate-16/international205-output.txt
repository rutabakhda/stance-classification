Non-Argumentative	with the lisbon treaty reforms, the eu has sought, amongst other things, to strengthen and to streamline its common foreign and security policy (cfsp) and to develop further its common security and defense policy (csdp).
Non-Argumentative	 as part of this, the post of high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy (hr) has been joined with that of first vice president of the commission (vp) responsible for external relations (including development and relations between the eu and neighbouring states to the east and south).
Non-Argumentative	 the holder of this post (hrvp), currently baroness catherine ashton, acts on the basis of agreement within the commission and unanimous agreement between all the eu foreign ministers.
Non-Argumentative	 her stated goal is to steer the eu foreign policy agenda and represent the eu as a united front.
Non-Argumentative	 with this post – as well as that of the european council president – the eu will have partially answered the question: if we want to talk to europe, who do we call?
Non-Argumentative	 the creation of the post of hrvp is a culmination of a number of different efforts to turn the initial project for a common foreign and security policy (cfsp) – adopted under the maastricht treaty in– into a workable, better integrated policy that is able to respond to international crises more quickly and to present a united front to the world on behalf of the eu.
Non-Argumentative	 it is a direct response to both internal and external criticisms that the eu has had to face over the lastyears in its handling of a variety of international crises; the breakup of the former yugoslavia, the ‘war on terror’ and theinvasion of iraq.
Non-Argumentative	 with bigger budgetary and diplomatic powers - including the creation of a dedicated eu diplomatic service (the european external action service) -   the newly strengthened post of hrvp may set the stage for the creation of an increasingly stronger political union along practical rather than rhetorical lines.
Argumentative	 the eu has slowly been building up its own common military framework , with the uk and france leading the effort to pool european military capacity .
Argumentative	 in addition , the eu itself has created new institutional bodies such as the political and security committee , a military committee and military staff .
Argumentative	 the eu has had military envoys in macedonia and bosnia-herzegovina and has committed itself to the creation of a common security and defense policy with 3-4 ,000 troops on permanent standby in multilateral ` battlegroups ' ready for immediate deployment , see rockwell schnabel 's article listed below ,.
Argumentative	 while incremental , these are steps not to be ignored .
Argumentative	 the union has also placed that military capacity within the broader context of a security strategy designed to promote international peace , justice and development .
Argumentative	 while the new ` eu high representative for foreign and security policy ' marks only a bold first step towards a more unified voice for the eu , the decisions are indeed still based on a state by state consultation mechanism -- hence the name representative .
Argumentative	 this should however not to be downplayed as a less significant change in how the eu approaches its foreign policy .
Argumentative	 the consultation aspect is in fact essential to reaching agreement and the importance of not only presenting a united front to the rest of the world , the eu is exemplary in trade policy and environmental policy , but less important when it comes to presenting a united voice in foreign policy as belgian foreign minister mark eyskens put it in`` europe is an economic giant , a political dwarf , and a military worm '', but also creating a united front through collaboration and debate .
Argumentative	 one should thus see this not only as a means to an end , but rather as an important mechanism in itself , whereby new identities are slowly created along with a deeper sense of commitment to a common set of values .
Argumentative	 the creation of a post of high representative and vice president of the commission , hrvp , marks an important change in the decision making process at the eu level with regards to foreign policy .
Argumentative	 agreement on the post showed a clear commitment to the pursuit of a common eu foreign policy and to developing a unique cooperative model for foreign and defense policy decision making that goes beyond the nation state .
Argumentative	 member states should now deliver on that commitment by seeking as much common ground as possible to ensure that the high representative 's role is truly significant .
Argumentative	 the goal of a common foreign and security policy should thus be supported not only as a mechanism to streamline eu 's position and role in world politics , but also to reinforce notions of cooperation and consultation essential for maintaining a stable international system , in line with the stated goals of the eu .
Argumentative	 , thestars in a circle is meant to symbolize the ideals of unity , solidarity and harmony among the peoples of europe ,.
Argumentative	 the high representative will not only act as a spokesman for eu nations when they agree on foreign policies , but will act as a catalyst around which external policy will increasingly become coordinated .
Argumentative	 by chairing meetings of eu foreign ministers , he or she will be able to shape the agenda and influence the outcomes of meetings , encouraging member states increasingly to think in terms of common foreign policy positions .
Argumentative	 they will have added authority from their ability to speak for the eu in the un security council .
Argumentative	 the high representative will also direct the eu 's new external action service , which brings together policy specialists from both the council and commission in a unique manner , ranging from the arctic region to nuclear safety and enlargement ,.
Argumentative	 with representatives all over the world the eu will develop a foreign service capable of creating and articulating policy positions in a manner that few national governments can match .
Argumentative	 over time this will promote the evolution of a true eu foreign and security policy , and will contribute significantly to increased european consciousness among eu citizens and further moves to political unity .
