Non-Argumentative	on the 26th februarythe ukrainian parliament voted to send the country’s president viktor yanukovych to the icc in the hague.
Non-Argumentative	  and he is not the only one; at the same time they have also voted that the former interior minister vitali zakharchenko and the prosecutor general, viktor pshonka should also be tried by the icc.
Non-Argumentative	 this is for “crimes against humanity during peaceful protests in ukraine since november 30,until february 22, 2014”.
Non-Argumentative	the protests were the result of the president deciding on 21st novembernot to agree a trade and association agreement with the eu and instead turn towards russia.
Non-Argumentative	 yanukovych’s actions may have been pragmatic - ukraine needed money and russia was willing to provide while the eu was not but the opposition took to the streets.
Non-Argumentative	 the result was months of standoff with some violence.
Non-Argumentative	 on the 16th january the ukranian parliament attempted to end the protests by passing anti-protest laws which included banning any rallys, vaguely defined extremist activity, and clamping down on freedom of speech and the press.
Non-Argumentative	 the result was the protests became riots and occupations of government buildings.
Non-Argumentative	throughout the protests there had been attacks, disappearances, and beatings of protestors, but on 18th february protestors advanced on ukraine’s parliament sparking three days of serious violence.
Non-Argumentative	 the police used rubber bullets and live ammunition including sniper fire and automatic weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 on the 20th riot police attempted to regain lost ground and the minister of the interior zakharchenko stated “law enforcement officers have received service firearms and will use them in accordance with ukraine’s law on police” so authorising the use of firearms to beat back the protesters.
Non-Argumentative	 the health ministry said there weredead andwounded in the three days of fighting, though the toll may well have been higher.
Non-Argumentative	the next day yanukovych agreed to mediation by the french, german and polish foreign ministers leading to a deal between the opposition and the president.
Non-Argumentative	 the deal restored theconstitution, provided an amnesty to protestors and promised elections.
Non-Argumentative	 despite it seeming to be a deal to stop violence rather than change government yanukovych decided the game was up and fled with the ukrainian parliament and the protestors taking over control.
Non-Argumentative	in the short term a trial in either the hague or ukraine is unlikely; he has turned up in moscow.
Non-Argumentative	 russia has agreed to give yanukovych protection so is unlikely to extradite him, especially as he is still a useful player as he still claims to be the president, and until a new election he has some justification to do so.
Non-Argumentative	 yanukovych himself says “the ukrainian parliament is illegitimate” before adding that “decisions taken in parliament were taken under duress” so any attempt to try him is as illegitimate as the takeover.
Argumentative	  even before most of the violence by riot police in february some experts were suggesting that yanukovych had committed crimes against humanity -- crimes committed by a state against a civilian population .
Argumentative	 professor alexander j motyl argued `` the yanukovych regime may already be guilty of `` imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law '' and `` persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender ... or other grounds . ''''
Argumentative	 now at the very least murder can be added to that count .
Argumentative	 having the icc prosecute yanukovych currently faces a major difficulty ; ukraine has not ratified the rome statute .
Argumentative	 it is therefore outside the jurisdiction of the court .
Argumentative	 technically this means the parliament ca n't ask for icc prosecution as there is no state party to refer the situation to the prosecutor .
Argumentative	 clearly there is an easy solution to this ; ukraine should ratify the statute .
Argumentative	 this would have the benefit of reaffirming international criminal law , showing that it can be beneficial in a crisis , and increasing it as an accepted norm .
Argumentative	 justice is about the past .
Argumentative	 but when prosecuting someone there also needs to be a thought for the present and the future of the country .
Argumentative	 in the case of prosecuting yanukovych there could be serious consequences as he had support in one half of the country .
Argumentative	 ukraine is a divided country with many in the east considering themselves to not be ukrainian , and certainly look to moscow not the eu .
Argumentative	 the new administration has already abolish a law that made russian a second language in the country so infringing the rights of many in the east .
Argumentative	 trying a former leader in kiev would be similarly provocative to those who believe yanukovych is still the legitimate president , or even those who may not agree with yanukovych but dislike the westward movement even more .
Argumentative	 while it would be unlikely to cause conflict on its own the action would certainly be an aggravating factor if other actions against the east of the country are being taken .
Argumentative	 justice for yanukovych should be international simply because it would be a much better guarantor of a fair trial .
Argumentative	 the ukrainian justice system is unfortunately corrupt , and at the behest of prosecutors ; it has an amazing conviction rate of 99.8 % .
Argumentative	 this is because judges are they are only appointed for five years then the government confirms tenure if it believes they have been voting the right way .
Argumentative	 yulia tymoshenko , an opponent of yanukovych , was imprisoned for making a deal with president putin to ensure gas supplies -- something that was a humanitarian necessity to ensure russia did not freeze ukraine into submission .
