Non-Argumentative	isolationism is a form of foreign policy in which a state seeks to avoid all international entanglements, including political alliances, commitments, organizations, and trade agreements.
Non-Argumentative	 there are usually two parts to such a policy.
Non-Argumentative	 first is non-interventionism, meaning the state will not involve itself in international military alliances and will not engage in conflict except to protect its own vital interests.
Non-Argumentative	 second is protectionism, wherein the state sets up legal barriers to trade and to cultural exchange.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states held to a policy of isolationism for most of its history ending permanently only in the 20th century with the second world war and subsequent cold war.
Non-Argumentative	 a number of american politicians, scholars, and a growing number of concerned citizens have begun to advocate a return to isolationism.
Non-Argumentative	 they cite the risks and costs of american involvement on the world stage and decry its position as de facto world police, which they see as not only an expensive endeavor, but also dangerous to the security of the state.
Non-Argumentative	 they also argue that the dangers of its trade deficit brought on by a lack of trade barriers create the risk of the united states becoming the economic thrall of its creditors.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents of such views point out that the decades since the united states has become the primary actor on the world stage have been marked by an unprecedented degree of stability and prosperity across the globe, and that its withdrawal from world affairs might create dangerous disorder.
Non-Argumentative	 they also cite the fact that the american economy, dependent on free trade, would contract and its people's standard of living would diminish should it pursue a policy of isolationism.
Argumentative	 debates on this issue revolve around the issues of whether the united states has a moral right to withdraw from the international system, whether such withdrawal would be overly harmful to world security and stability, and whether it would be inordinately harmful to the united states' own society.

Argumentative	 by pursuing this course the united states was able to avoid involvement in the ruinous wars of europe that wracked that continent during the 18th and 19th centuries , sapping their strength and ultimately bringing about the downfalls of their far-flung empires .
Argumentative	 during those same years the united states was able to focus on its own growth , fighting only when its own vital interests were at stake , and pushed its borders from being just a small nation on the eastern coast of the north american continent to the point whereby it was a continent-spanning giant1 .
Argumentative	 it was only during world war one that the united states broke with its long tradition of non-entanglement with foreign powers , and its involvement in that conflict led it to be embroiled in the foreign intrigues and power games that made the 20th and early 21st centuries ones of almost constant american involvement in wars ; wars that were always in far-flung locales in which the united states ' vital interests did not truly lie .
Argumentative	 in order to escape the entanglements of the international system , the united states must seek to disengage itself and to pursue once again a policy of concern for its own interests without concern for the happenings of other states .

Argumentative	 the growing economic cost of this international security provision , along with the domestic security threats created by it create the risk that the united states could collapse under the pressure , as so many powerful states have done in the past ; just as rome fell due to its stretching its resources too thin , so too might the united states2 .

Argumentative	 its interventions in korea , vietnam , kosovo , iraq , afghanistan , and others have proven costly in both blood and treasure1 .
Argumentative	 for all its efforts , the united states has gained little in terms of material benefits for its own people .

Argumentative	 eventually china , and , other net exporters to the united states will be able to pull its economic strings , and thus dominate it politically .
Argumentative	 for the united states to retain its political and economic autonomy , it must rein in its overactive spending as well as its borrowing from abroad .
Argumentative	 the only way to accomplish this is through a policy promoting domestic self-sufficiency by means of raising trade barriers with states and firms abroad .
Argumentative	 through a regime of protective tariffs and forced trade balancing , the united states can expand domestic industries and rebuild those that have atrophied due to foreign competition .
Argumentative	 it is through such policies that it can restore itself to the position of a net exporter and escape the economic invasion of foreign powers2 .
Argumentative	 the result of an isolationist policy for the economy will be a more self-sufficient nation with domestic industries capable of providing for the needs of its citizens , and one not dependent on any other state for vital commodities .
Argumentative	 the united states is particularly well suited to such an enterprise due to its immense size and wealth in resources and human capital .
Argumentative	 there is no need for such damaging economic relations as it has pursued , as allowing itself to be tied into the international economic system only exposes it to the machinations of unfriendly foreign powers and also makes it susceptible to contagion effects of economic crises in international markets .
Argumentative	 clearly , the wise path is for america to protect its own economic interests through protectionism and isolationism .
