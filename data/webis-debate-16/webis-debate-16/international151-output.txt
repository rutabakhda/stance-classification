Non-Argumentative	migration has remained a key concern in africa over time; with research focused on identifying the patterns of migration, scope of migration, and fundamentally understand why people move.
Non-Argumentative	 with 'mobility' identified as a key characteristics of our contemporary age, various trends can be found across africa.
Non-Argumentative	 with records showing rising rates in international immigration; and increased inter-continental movement, new theories have emerged to provide reasoning for such realities.
Non-Argumentative	 whether as a result of choice or constraint, such as a natural disaster, a livelihood strategy or individual decision to seek employment, the contemporary reality of migration shows movement needs to be prioritised, discussed, and debated.
Non-Argumentative	 with the stabilisation of an african union, or pan-african agenda, concern over climate change, and complexities of urbanisation, new policies and understandings are required for migration, and migrants.
Non-Argumentative	therefore in taking a synthesised perspective this debate asks what government policies are needed.
Non-Argumentative	 two key relationships are introduced: the relation between migration and development; and that of migration and rights.
Non-Argumentative	 a free labour market is defined as a market sphere which enables liberty, and freedom, between buyers and sellers, to exchange, trade, and mobilise.
Non-Argumentative	 in this case, the labour market is referred to in three contexts: internal (synthesising rural and urban markets), crossborders, and regional.
Non-Argumentative	 the question remains, by encouraging a laissez-faire approach to the movement of people, goods, and services, can a solution be found to underlying issues across africa?
Non-Argumentative	in debating the relevance of a free labour market, and migration, across africa this debate centres on why it remains important in contemporary africa; and to what extent the policy will have desirable practical effects.
Argumentative	 can the rights of migrants be met; and what opportunities does migration raise?
Argumentative	a free labour market provides a space for sharing , knowledge , ideas , and socio-cultural traditions , competing , and sustaining efficiency in development .
Argumentative	 as neoliberal theory advocates a laissez-faire approach is fundamental for growth .
Argumentative	 a free labour market will enhance economic productivity .
Argumentative	 free labour movement enables access to new employment opportunities and markets .
Argumentative	 within the east african community the common market protocol , cmp ,  has removed barriers towards the movement of people , services , capital , and goods .
Argumentative	 free regional movement is granted to citizens of any member state in order to aid economic growth .
Argumentative	 free movement is providing solutions to regional poverty by expanding the employment opportunities available , enabling faster and efficient movement for labour , and reducing the risk of migration for labour .
Argumentative	 similar to initial justifications of europe 's labour market , a central idea is to promote labour productivity within the region .
Argumentative	 recent reports by the hdr  and wdr  have shown migration is a means of development -- free movement has the power to alleviate poverty , enable markets , and connectivity .
Argumentative	 taking recent evidence concerning worldwide remittance flows , the developmental nature of free movement is shown .
Argumentative	 in, it is estimated , through international migration , $ 414bn were remitted back to developing countries .
Argumentative	 remittance flows into africa , from within and internationally , accounted for $ 40bn in, accounting for an increasing percentage of gdp , afdb ,; ifad  .
Argumentative	 northern africa articulated the largest total of remittances received .
Argumentative	 remittances remain beneficial for supporting livelihoods .
Argumentative	 the influx of remittances to households provides security , an additional income for support , enables household consumption , and investment in alternative assets , such as education and land , of which present crucial benefits in reducing poverty .
Argumentative	 although the geography of remittances remains uneven , and currently barriers remain to sending and receiving money , the developmental potential of remittances from african diasporas , both outside and within africa , is now recognised .
Argumentative	 national borders are a result of africa 's colonial history .
Argumentative	 the boundaries constructed do not reflect meaning or unite ethnic groups across the continent .
Argumentative	 the border between togo and ghana alone divides the dagomba , akposso , konkomba and ewe peoples .
Argumentative	 therefore encouraging freedom of movement across africa will erase a vital component of africa 's colonial history .
Argumentative	 the erasing of boundaries , for labour markets , will have significant impacts for rebuilding a sense of unity , and reducing xenophobic fears , of which have been politically constructed .
Argumentative	 a sense of unity will motivate citizens to reduce disparities and inequalities of poverty .
Argumentative	 even without the implementation of a free labour market , migration will continue informally ; therefore policies introducing free movement and providing appropriate travel documents provides a method to manage migration .
Argumentative	 in the case of southern africa , the lack of a regional framework enabling migration is articulated through the informal nature of movement and strategic bilateral ties between nation-states .
Argumentative	 several benefits arise from managing migration .
Argumentative	 first , speeding up the emigration process will provide health benefits .
Argumentative	 evidence shows slow , and inefficient , border controls have led to a rise in hiv/aids ; as truck drivers wait in delays sex is offered .
Argumentative	 second , a free labour market can provide national governments with data and information .
Argumentative	 the provision of travel documentation provides migrants with an identity , and as movement is monitored , the big picture of migration can be provided .
Argumentative	 information , evidence , and data , will enable effective policies to be constructed for places of origin and destination , and to enable trade efficiency .
Argumentative	 lastly , today , undocumented migrants are unable to claim their right to health care .
Argumentative	 in africa , availability does not equate to accessibility for new migrants .
Argumentative	 in south africa , migrants fear deportation and harassment , meaning formal health treatment and advice is not sought , human rights watch  .
Argumentative	 therefore documentation and formal approval of movement ensures health is recognised as an equal right .
Argumentative	 mobility is a human right - which needs to be enabled across national spaces and africa .
Argumentative	 obstacles need to be removed .
Argumentative	 mobility enables access to interconnected rights - such as ensuring women their right to move enables empowerment in the political , social and economic spheres .
Argumentative	 taking the case of migration of young people , the process reflects a right of passage , a means of exploring opportunities and identity.
Argumentative	for example the mourides of senegal have established a dense network sustaining informal trading across multiple scales based on a foundation of ` brotherhood ' youths leaving rural areas become integrated into dynamic social networks and educated within the mouride culture .
Argumentative	 as research in tanzania shows although migration is not a priority for all youths , many identify the opportunity as a time to prove yourself and establish your transition into adulthood .
Argumentative	 the process empowers human identity and rights .
