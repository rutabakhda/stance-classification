Non-Argumentative	in many democracies, the legislature consists of two separate ‘chambers’ or ‘houses’.
Non-Argumentative	 this practice is called ‘bicameralism’.
Non-Argumentative	 usually, the lower house is directly elected by the people.
Non-Argumentative	 in the past, membership of the upper house was hereditary, like the house of lords in the united kingdom, which today still had hereditary seats, or japan’s house of peers, which untilwas hereditary.
Non-Argumentative	 nowadays the upper house is usually either appointed by another governing body, or indirectly elected.
Non-Argumentative	an example of an appointed upper house is the senate of canada.
Non-Argumentative	 in this system, each major area in canada hasseats.
Non-Argumentative	 members are appointed by the governor general (a largely ceremonial function) on the ‘advice’ the prime minister (so, practically the prime minister appoints the members) and remain in their seats until they reach the age of 75.
Non-Argumentative	an example of an indirectly elected upper house is the dutch ‘eerste kamer’.
Non-Argumentative	 in this system,  each province has an allotted number of seats based on their respective population sizes.
Non-Argumentative	 members for the seats are then chosen via election by the provincial legislatures and remain in their seats until the next provincial elections, after which the renewed provincial legislatures will hold a new election for the upper house.
Non-Argumentative	this case argues that the upper house should be directly elected by the people, just as the lower house, but via a different voting system.
Non-Argumentative	 an example of this is the united states senate (upper house) vis-à-vis the united states house of representatives (lower house).
Non-Argumentative	 whereas in the house of representatives each state has seats apportioned according to their population size, in the senate each state is represented by two senators, regardless of their population size.
Non-Argumentative	 because the direct election system for both the lower and upper house can vary in different legislatures, i am not going to specify which exact voting system the upper house will be using – i only assume that it is a direct voting system different from the direct voting system for the lower house.
Non-Argumentative	the upper house and lower house can also differ in the amount of legislative power they have.
Non-Argumentative	 usually, in so-called presidential systems, where the executive is directly elected, the upper house has equal legislative powers as the lower house.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, the united states senate is generally equal to, and in some special cases even more powerful than, the house of representatives.
Non-Argumentative	 in many parliamentary systems, where the executive is derived from the lower house, the upper house usually has less powers then the lower house.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, the senate of canada, unlike the house of canada, can’t force the prime minister to resign.
Non-Argumentative	 the dutch ‘eerste kamer’ can’t initiate legislation whereas the ‘tweede kamer’ can.
Argumentative	this case also makes no choice as to what the exact division of powers should be between the separate houses and focuses only on the question whether it should be directly elected by the people or not.
Argumentative	democracy means self-governance by the people , wherein citizens have the fundamental right to decide how they are to be governed and by whom .
Argumentative	 an appointed or indirectly elected upper house violates this principle , because allows a group of individuals to exercise power without having to explain or justify themselves to the public .
Argumentative	 when an upper house is directly elected , it will be perceived to be more legitimate by the public , because the public sees their political views directly translated into a legislative branch , albeit in a different way than the lower house .
Argumentative	 this enhanced legitimacy will help the upper house in performing their constitutional duties : whenever the upper house disagrees with either the lower house or the executive , the upper house can now strengthen their position by pointing to the public support it has .
Argumentative	 politicians who elect or appoint the members of the upper house have an incentive to put their friends an allies there , because this will make their decision making easier .
Argumentative	 this is patronage pure and simple : the public will have a hard time sending them away when , if ever , a scandal breaks because the members of the upper house do n't depend on public opinion to remain in their seats .
Argumentative	 an example is the case of a senator in the netherlands , sam pormes .
Argumentative	 after an opinion magazine revealed he once had partaken in terrorist activities , it took almost a year and several mediation attempts to get him removed from parliament .
