Non-Argumentative	inturkey’s prime minister recep tayyip erdogan visited germany, surprisingly for a national leader visiting a country with a large number of turkish migrants he declared assimilation a “crime against humanity” and argued that turks in germany should study in their mother tongue, the language of one’s parents which is usually that learned from birth in the home, in schools and universities.
Non-Argumentative	large immigrant groups can be found all over the world.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states and canada are particularly known as immigrant nations but immigrants go elsewhere as well and there are many countries that are net recipients of migrants such the european union and it is not restricted to richer states, oman and malaysia were among countries with more immigrants than emigrants from 2008-12.
Non-Argumentative	 examples relevant to this debate are hispanics of mexican origin that reside in the united states, the turkish and polish population that is currently living in germany or austria and also large asian communities living in canada.
Non-Argumentative	the form of stimulating (or subsidizing) mother tongue education for large immigrant groups taken in this debate is allocating money from the national education budget to permit foreign parents that are part of such a group to build and implement school programs taught in their native language.
Non-Argumentative	a different model of implementation would change the line of reason, the advantages and disadvantages of the motion and therefore the debate.
Non-Argumentative	 ideas will still be valid if they are the consequence of your proposed policy.
Non-Argumentative	it is difficult to generalise about the situation of mother-tongue learning among immigrant groups.
Non-Argumentative	 some countries demand more integrated than others.
Non-Argumentative	 in europe migrants are often perceived as forming closed-circle societies with low and sometimes no interaction with people who are not immigrants, in the united states the opposite is the case and it is assumed a migrant will integrate.
Non-Argumentative	 in reality almost all states are somewhere between the two poles.
Non-Argumentative	 parents that are the first and sometimes the second generation of immigrants understandably choose to talk to their children and within the family in their mother tongue.
Non-Argumentative	 this phenomenon leads most of the times in children who are struggling to get education and achieve a better integration with the local people.
Argumentative	 everyone should have the right to communicate in their own mother tongue so enabling them to maintain their roots with their mother country .
Argumentative	 in a world of change , where people are able to move their residence from a country to another country , protecting minority rights becomes necessary .
Argumentative	 some migrations are historically and economically driven , take place over decades , and involve large numbers .
Argumentative	 for example , an estimated 33.7 million hispanics of mexican origin live in the united states , with 11.4 million immigrants born in mexico , accounting for almost 3.5 % of the us population .
Argumentative	 in europe , a lot of migration there have been successive waves of migration , as a result of world war ii , the end of empires , economic boom and the european union .
Argumentative	 to take germany first there was an influx from lands germany lost as a result of the war , of turks to help power the economic miracle meaning that now more that 2.6 million turks live in germany , and recently there has been an influx from eastern and southern europe as germany 's economy has held up in the economic crisis .
Argumentative	 each wave , or group of immigrants , forms a distinct community within their host nation .
Argumentative	 there is no reason why these groups should be forced to entirely give up their old identity as they embrace a new identity as a part of their host nation .
Argumentative	 just as every human has rights so does every immigrant .
Argumentative	 part of these rights should be education in the mother tongue .
Argumentative	 language is what connects people and makes them able to communicate their feelings , emotions and ideas .
Argumentative	 a person should be able to communicate and express ideas in its own mother tongue in order to be able to create a connection with their family and the immigrant community that they live in .
Argumentative	 because parents that are immigrants teach their kids only the mother tongue , at the age in which they should go to school they barely know the local language .
Argumentative	 their parents sometimes do n't know the language of the country that they live in and other times they choose not to use it at home .
Argumentative	 therefore , at the age when children have to go to school , they have little or no interaction with the language of the country they live in .
Argumentative	 in the united states ,% of immigrant families speak a language other than english at home and% live in households where no one has a strong command of the english language .
Argumentative	 this simply hands over the problem of language to the school damaging education across all subjects .
Argumentative	 this is because the children will not be able to communicate with other kids in school or understand what the teacher is saying .
Argumentative	 because of the exclusion that the immigrants feel when going to school and the fact that they are not able to understand much of what is taught , they choose to leave school early .
Argumentative	 70 % of turkish children in germany have no general certificate of secondary education ; as they leave before completing secondary school .
Argumentative	 by far the most sensible way to solve this problem is to send these children to a school where they do understand the language in which they are being taught .
Argumentative	 being able to learn and teach in our own language will preserve the culture of large immigrant groups as part of another state , this is both good for that community and for the nation .
Argumentative	 for the community and the individual speaking and learning their own language will give immigrants a sense of belonging .
Argumentative	 they are part of a community that they know and understand because it speaks the same language even before they come to know the rest of the country .
Argumentative	 this provides security , belonging , and close contact with relatives .
Argumentative	 for the community it means keeping their own customs and identity alive , in a few cases this may actually be contributing to conserving a language .
Argumentative	 for the country as a whole this does not represent a threat as there can be many different levels of identity that all intermix .
Argumentative	 instead it provides an opportunity ; it diversifies the country .
Argumentative	 it gains the benefit of a different perspective on problems and new ideas as people who speak different languages think about things in different ways so it is useful for innovation to have many different communities brought up in different languages interacting .
Argumentative	 it also gains from having another culture add diversity to its own ; there are new festivals , concerts , art , and perhaps most commonly encountered a greater diversity of cuisines to be sampled through restaurants .
Argumentative	 if the government decides to promote mother tongue education for large immigrant groups it will be enhancing mutual understanding between its own population and another nation as the immigrants provide a go between .
Argumentative	 the state will send a positive message towards the large immigrant groups by allowing them to study in their first language .
Argumentative	 it will acknowledge the importance of such groups in the national society by providing this additional opportunity .
Argumentative	 the importance of cooperation between immigrant groups and the state is often recognized , for example in combating extremism , this kind of measure encourages such cooperation as it brings with it the good will of the immigrant community .
Argumentative	 on the other hand , promoting diversity will promote understanding between countries .
Argumentative	 a favorable treatment towards the large immigrant groups will be seen positively by the country the immigrants come from .
Argumentative	 having migrants creates a link between the two countries .
Argumentative	 this may produce clear advantages for both parties , in the form of collaboration , diplomacy and trade .
Argumentative	 the effect of migrants on trade is often ignored but studies have shown that in the case of spain from 1995-2008 exports are boosted by having immigrant communities ; `` doubling the number of immigrants from a certain country in a province leads to an increase of the export values from the destination province to the country of the immigrants ' origin by around% . ''
Argumentative	 the reason was because new exporting firms are created -- immigrants know the conditions in their own country so can access that market , something that would be impossible without a native understanding of the language .
