Non-Argumentative	despite ongoing debates about cause and effect, the protest movements that began in tunisia and spread throughout the arab world have had one clear vehicle: freedom of assembly and expression.
Non-Argumentative	 the crowds of arab youth that have assembled in cities, towns and villages have forced authoritarian rulers to recognise them, their right to protest the status quo and their right to demand change.
Non-Argumentative	 while in some countries winning this right has been accomplished relatively easily and quickly, in other countries it has been difficult, dangerous and deadly.
Non-Argumentative	 yet protesters have continued to demand the right to voice their grievances against the powers that be.
Non-Argumentative	while demands have largely been aired using traditional means like word of mouth, demonstrations, marches and sit-ins and broadcast via satellite television channels, we have also seen an explosion of creative ideas and creative solutions.
Non-Argumentative	 from the use of colourful graffiti in libya to new and social media in egypt and syria, young arabs have made their voices heard through a variety of new platforms.
Non-Argumentative	yet one tool the majority of arab protesters have not used is radio.
Non-Argumentative	like many other traditional media tools, radio has been declared dead numerous times only to see its revival and novel usage in new settings and contexts.
Non-Argumentative	 but while the rest of the world, including many semi-closed regimes, has been tolerant of private and community radio, the arab world, including some relatively open societies, has limited radio licences to government organisations or the elite business entities that circulate within their orbit.
Non-Argumentative	there are historic reasons for this anti-radio policy.
Non-Argumentative	 as radio was experiencing its golden age, the post-colonial arab world witnessed repeated revolutions and coups in which military generals took over national radio stations along with presidential palaces.
Non-Argumentative	 the first communiqué announcing a new ruler was usually broadcast over radio, and all other government organs quickly fell in line.
Non-Argumentative	 these military dictators who took power by capturing the radio network would naturally oppose others using it to challenge their power.
Non-Argumentative	 in the arab world, the buildings that housed radio stations, and later television stations, often became the most heavily guarded pieces of real estate in the country.
Non-Argumentative	 media outlets were effectively turned into military installations with multiple forms of identification and body searches required for entrance.
Non-Argumentative	the programming broadcast by these stations was also entirely controlled by central governments.
Non-Argumentative	 a direct telephone line would connect the office of the radio or television director to the palace of the president or king.
Non-Argumentative	 even with the proliferation of satellite television and the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, radio licences remained limited to rulers’ most loyal and trusted friends.
Non-Argumentative	 when private licences were granted, station owners were given clear instructions not to deal with politics and news.
Non-Argumentative	 this system ensured that news coverage was sanitised of anything that might disturb or question the prevailing government narrative.
Non-Argumentative	 the stark absence of local news ensured that the public’s attention was diverted from pressing social, economic and political issues in their communities.
Non-Argumentative	this control over media sources was so entrenched that even when the arab uprisings managed to unseat ruling powers, little was done to change the prevailing media structures.
Non-Argumentative	 it became clear that changing rulers was easier than changing the media regulatory framework that had been built up over decades.
Non-Argumentative	the millions of protesters in tahrir square, alexandria and suez who succeeded in creating geographical zones free of security and police control were unable to even think about—let alone work towards—creating an equivalent on local radio stations through which they could propagate their revolutionary vision.
Non-Argumentative	 transmitter equipment was nowhere to be found and electrical engineers were not called on to create simple transmission systems.
Non-Argumentative	 decades of government intimidation had clearly had its effect on the psyche of everyday egyptians, tunisians and yemenis, leaving the airwaves uncontested by revolutionary voices.
Non-Argumentative	autocratic arab rulers who enforced national unity by the power of the gun were certainly not interested in media that encouraged and empowered local communities to celebrate their specific ethnicity, language, culture or religion.
Non-Argumentative	 to deny this basic communication capacity ensures that these populations remain forever ignorant, unable to educate themselves and therefore unable to fight for their rights.
Non-Argumentative	some powers wrongly claim that community-based media will exacerbate tensions between various ethnic and national communities, contribute to the break-up of countries and even spread civil war across the middle east.
Non-Argumentative	 the fact is that people living in the various countries that make up the arab league are diverse in a multitude of ways.
Non-Argumentative	 instead of denying this diversity and forcing people of different backgrounds to conform to a single cultural and national identity, a more humane approach would be to allow these diverse flowers to bloom within their national garden.
Non-Argumentative	 by embracing and empowering these different groups, the arab world’s new rulers will be planting the seeds for stable governing bodies that will better withstand both internal and external threats.
Non-Argumentative	 community radio would therefore be a saviour for these new regimes rather than an obstacle.communities, especially those outside the main metropolitan capitals of the arab world, have largely been ignored by autocratic powers.
Non-Argumentative	 now that these totalitarian power structures are being replaced by democratically elected governments, one would hope that new leaders will change their policies towards these communities for the better.
Non-Argumentative	 allowing community radio to thrive costs governments nothing and produces amazing results in communities, and therefore in nations.
Argumentative	 creating a welcoming administrative and legal environment for community radio in the arab world should be a “no-brainer”—provided we have leaders that genuinely care about their communities.
Argumentative	the events of the arab spring , and previous events such as the revolutions of, have shown that effective means of communicating are vital .
Argumentative	 in a country where people have heard only one perspective , anything that can break the monopoly is to be welcomed .
Argumentative	 as orwell put it , ` in an age of universal deceit , to tell the truth is a subversive act ' .
Argumentative	 community radio can both encourage an initial outpouring of democracy and , just as importantly , ensure that a diversity of opinions means that one autocratic regime is not just replaced by another .
Argumentative	 community radio relies on the power of its ideas and the thirst for those ideas among its audience .
Argumentative	 it accepts the notion that it is the exchange of information and views , freely given and received , that is more important than the ideas themselves .
Argumentative	 it does n't require massive budgets and radio waves can be received on equipment that costs pennies ; more importantly it can be shared .
Argumentative	 autocracy has , at its root , the premise that only one perspective , or group of perspectives is legitimate .
Argumentative	 certain assumptions are unquestionable , certain rules inviolable and , more often than not , certain voices unchallengeable .
Argumentative	 it 's all too easy for that state of affairs to be normalised .
Argumentative	 community radio offers another voice .
Argumentative	 more to the point it offers many .
Argumentative	 as well as the value of the messages themselves , the very fact that they are there and broadcast is a powerful statement against autocratic assumptions .
Argumentative	 the process of establishing and running a community radio station is , in and of itself , a powerful fillip for community cohesion .
