Non-Argumentative	three days after the broadcast, radio producer antony pitts resigned, saying the bbc had flouted its own guidelines and brushed off complaints.
Non-Argumentative	 bbc director-general mark thompson stood by the corporation’s decision: “i am a practicing christian, but there is nothing in this which i believe to be blasphemous.”
Non-Argumentative	one organisation, christian voice, failed in its efforts to sue the bbc for blasphemous libel after two high court judges ruled that broadcasters and theatres could not be prosecuted under this offence.
Non-Argumentative	 they added that as a parody of jerry springer, the us chat show, and not of christianity, the programme could not be deemed blasphemous.
Argumentative	- maryam omiditherefore , those who watched it made a choice to do so -- and it seems reasonable to consider that an informed choice .
Argumentative	 a free society is predicated on the fact that adults have the right to make choices .
Argumentative	 in turn that is based on the shared understanding that those choices have consequences ; which may , potentially , cause some degree of harm to the person making that choice .
Argumentative	 having been warned that watching the broadcast may cause them offence , viewers still chose to and some , it seems , were duly offended .
Argumentative	 it seems reasonable , therefore , to assume that the shock was either feigned or a matter of pretence .
Argumentative	 which leaves the matter of blasphemy ; an offence against a belief system .
Argumentative	 there was no secret that religious issues were likely to feature in the broadcast and no secret was made of the fact that those views were likely to be both critical and forthright .
Argumentative	 tuning in , specifically to be offended by something that the viewer had been warned they might find offensive seems perverse .
Argumentative	 by contrast , art lovers who wished to see the production - which had received four lawrence olivier awards among other tributes -- had the opportunity to experience a theatrical work they would have had a limited opportunity to witness had it not been broadcast nationally .
Argumentative	 many perceive commonly held positions in the mainstream churches -- let alone more extreme sects -- to be offensive or reactionary and , in some cases , a cover for homophobic , illiberal or sexist opinions .
Argumentative	 if religious opinion is to be granted this airtime for the benefit of a small , if vocal , minority then it seems both unfair and unprofessional for that broadcaster to be constrained by that groups views in relation to the rest of its output .
Argumentative	 the bbc , like most major broadcasters , meets the challenge of divergent or conflicting views by providing some output that is considered likely to be of interest to each viewpoint .
Argumentative	 the bbc is in an unusual position , simply because of its funding structure , to promote new or challenging works of art .
Argumentative	 the licence fee means that it is freed of many of the pressures brought to bear by either commercial or political masters .
Argumentative	 although it has never taken that to mean it has a carte blanche , it does allow for opportunities simply not available to many broadcasters in terms showcasing new works of art and encouraging creative development .
Argumentative	 it seems reasonable to suggest that many of those millions follow the bbc because they trust the corporation 's approach of providing the widest possible range of output and opinion .
Argumentative	 for such an organisation to capitulate to a prudish group -- who were outside bbc venues at the time so could n't have seen the broadcast -- would be a huge betrayal of that trust .
Argumentative	 the bbc would quickly be left with a content either devoid of interest or of content were it to allow such a veto to become normative .
Argumentative	 especially were it , as appears to be the case here , to offer such a veto to people who did n't watch the programme .
Argumentative	 as a result , although some of the responsibility for avoiding offence lies with the broadcaster at least an equal share must lie with the viewer .
Argumentative	 even at the more basic level of ` will i like this ' , responsibility lies with both parties .
Argumentative	 the bbc undertakes to provide a diverse range of programming so that there is a reasonable chance that the overwhelming majority should be able to find something of interest but does so on the assumption that people will watch what they find interesting .
Argumentative	 likewise , it is reasonable to assume that people will not go out of their way to watch things that they already expect to find offensive .
