Non-Argumentative	affirmative action (or positive discrimination) is the use of different standards for assessing different groups of people, so as to help a group that has historically been at a disadvantage.
Non-Argumentative	 in an education context, the relevant type of affirmative action is that used for admission to universities.
Non-Argumentative	 in particular, universities may wish to use affirmative action to raise the presence of poor students or students from ethnic minorities.
Non-Argumentative	 there are several affirmative action policies which occur around the world from new zealand where the maori minority is favoured to south africa where the legacy of apartheid aims to be corrected to the united states where black and hispanic students may be given preferential treatment in admission procedures.
Non-Argumentative	 such discrimination is a controversial issue, notably in the united states, where asupreme court decision ruled that universities are allowed to use the practice.
Non-Argumentative	 debates may either be about permitting universities to use positive discrimination (where it is currently illegal), or about the state requiring them to do so.
Non-Argumentative	 the mechanism could be one of two types: either using quotas to determine the outcome of the admissions process (e.g. requiring universities to admit a certain percentage of students from minority groups, deprived areas, or non-private schools), or by using different admissions criteria that take race, poverty or school-background into account.
Argumentative	Â affirmative action is required for equality of opportunity .
Argumentative	 under the status quo , it is easier for students who go to better schools to get into university .
Argumentative	 this is reflected in data from the uk - oxford and cambridge universities , the top academic institutions , take more than% of their students from private schools , despite% of uk schoolchildren state educated .
Argumentative	 in addition , there is a clear underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in these universities .
Argumentative	 a similar story is evident with regards to ethnic minorities in the usa - white students are more likely to graduate from high school and go to college than black and hispanic ones .
Argumentative	 these examples reflect the opportunities granted to wealthier children from particular socioeconomic and racial groups , whose superior education and less disruptive home lives give them a leg-up .
Argumentative	 it is unfair that such random aspects , which have nothing to do with talent or hard work , have such a determining influence on one 's life chances .
Argumentative	 moreover , it undermines meritocracy -- by allowing the rich to be advantaged , we create a society in which wealth , rather than ability , is rewarded .
Argumentative	 affirmative action is required to overcome existing prejudice in universities ' admissions procedures .
Argumentative	 there is clear prejudice in the job market , as shown in a study by marianne bertrand , an associate professor at the university of chicago graduate school of business , and sendhil mullainathan of massachusetts institute of technology .
Argumentative	 following this line of thinking , it is therefore not a far-fetched idea that admissions departments in top universities are likely to be discriminating against applicants from minority backgrounds , even if this process is not deliberate .
Argumentative	 a senior academic will look to see in applicants qualities they see in themselves , so , given the overwhelmingly white , affluent , male makeup of the academic community , minorities are at a disadvantage even if the admissions officer is not intending to discriminate against them .
Argumentative	 prejudice towards certain types of applicants is blatantly unfair , and also undermines meritocracy , as explained above .
Argumentative	 since we do not expect applicants from minority backgrounds to actually be worse applicants , it makes sense to require universities to take more of them , so as to protect the system from any bias that may exist .
Argumentative	 affirmative action is required to change negative perceptions of university life .
Argumentative	 in the status quo , many talented potential students are put off applying for top universities , or university at all , because of their negative perceptions of elite institutions .
Argumentative	 this perception exists in part because of the makeup of the student population -- black high school students may see a university filled overwhelmingly with white lecturers and students as not being a welcoming environment for them , and may even perceive it as racist .
Argumentative	 the only way to overcome this unfortunate stereotype of university is to change the student population , but this is impossible to do ` organically ' while so few people from minority backgrounds apply .
Argumentative	 therefore , it is necessary to use quotas and other forms of affirmative action , to change the student body in the short term , and encourage applications from more disadvantaged students in the long term .
Argumentative	 college admission processes are impersonal and favourably biased towards white , affluent students -- therefore , quotas specifically for minority students need to be established .
Argumentative	 college admissions processes are as such because they heavily rely on standard tests or college admission exams .
Argumentative	 this has caused countries such as brazil to create quotas for brown , mixed , and black students in most universities .
Argumentative	 these students can not afford the better education enjoyed by their rich , white counterparts , and therefore do not perform well in college exams and do not gain admission into university .
Argumentative	 quotas are needed to make the admission process a little bit fairer and increase the number of minorities in university campuses .
