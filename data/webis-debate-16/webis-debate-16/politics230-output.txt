Non-Argumentative	the relationship between the media and democracy is controversial.
Non-Argumentative	 the media always claim they just “inform the public” whilst critics claim they actually shape public opinion, thereby “controlling” democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 one possible way in which this happens is through opinion polls.
Non-Argumentative	 in an opinion poll, an organization, such as a political party, a research company or a media company, questions a representative panel of citizens (usually about 1000) about their opinions on a political subject or about candidates.
Non-Argumentative	 very often polls ask people how they would vote if there were an election today, and the media uses the results to project the share of the national vote that different parties would achieve.
Non-Argumentative	 such polls are very common in the period of an election campaign, when five or more different surveys may be published in a week, and the results are picked over in detail by political commentators.
Non-Argumentative	different countries take different attitudes to the role of opinion polls in a democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 many impose no limitations on the publication of polls in the media, but some, including france, south korea, mexico and taiwan, ban the publication of opinion polls in the days running up to a national election.
Non-Argumentative	 in france, for example, the media cannot publish opinion polls of voting intention in the week before each round of national voting.
Non-Argumentative	 the issue of opinion polls is particularly controversial in india where the election commission used to ban the publication of opinion polls in the days before and during national elections which are conducted over a period of some twenty days in five regional days of voting.
Non-Argumentative	 in 1999, the indian supreme court overturned this rule following a challenge brought by a newspaper.
Non-Argumentative	 however, today the main political parties have joined with the election commission in an attempt to reintroduce the ban.
Non-Argumentative	 a similar situation exists in canada where restrictions on the publication of opinion polls were overturned in its supreme court in 1998.
Non-Argumentative	it might be useful to focus the debate by determining what type of opinion polls are harming the democratic process: opinion polls about general subjects, polls projecting the outcome of elections before election-day, or exit-polls (which ask actual voters how they have cast their ballot) on election-day.
Non-Argumentative	 there could be a variety of choices for a particular plan and the debate which follows only offers one possible method.
Non-Argumentative	   likewise, the debate could occur primarily at the value level addressing the general influence of opinion polls on the democratic process.
Non-Argumentative	   the democratic process could include a variety of ways that citizens participate or are informed prior to the selection of policies and candidates.
Non-Argumentative	  in particular, harm to the democratic process should be addressed with some specificity if it is argued that harm occurs.
Non-Argumentative	  with the proliferation of public messages and the increased use of various media to carry those messages, the relationship of public opinion polls to democratic dialogue challenges the exploration of voter choices and the information on which those choices are made.
Argumentative	 in democratic nations public opinion matters as it is the public who ultimately decides who wins office and opinion polls measure that opinion .
Argumentative	 as a result politicians have become obsessed with the shifting whims of public opinion upon which the media focuses forcing politicians also focus on popular opinion even between elections .
Argumentative	 since the media carries the news , the active use of opinion polls by the media drives the policy agenda .
Argumentative	 lack of information on critical issues is likely to result as politicians focus only on areas where the opinion polls highlight .
Argumentative	 democracy is also harmed by the publication of opinion polls as subsequent citizen voter behaviour can be influenced .
Argumentative	 when , for example , an opinion poll portrays a huge majority for a certain subject , or for a particular party , its opponents might be less vocal since they feel `` outnumbered '' or that decisions have already been made thus diminishing democratic dialogue .
Argumentative	 undecided voters may be apathetic toward the election process since they appear to be a foregone conclusion .
Argumentative	 the potential influence on voters choices is the reason the france forbids opinion polls shortly before an election .
Argumentative	 since opinion polls are the products of research , they can also be heavily manipulated by the organization performing or commissioning the poll in question .
Argumentative	 a bias can easily be created by selecting a certain target group , such as aap opinion poll which asked more democrats than republicans , or more usually through asking certain questions or phrasing them in a particular way .
Argumentative	 for example it has been found that americans are more likely to support spending for the ` poor ' than for ` welfare ' .
Argumentative	 this information can generate false information and untrue or exaggerated claims .
Argumentative	 even if the research is done with an objective mindset , the research technique or reporting method can skew the results .
Argumentative	 for example , the opinion polls seldom report the measure of uncertainty of the conclusions , by for example reporting standards deviations from means , sample size , etc, these measures are usually not published .
Argumentative	 reporting the results of opinion polls without further statistical information leads to more misinformation .
Argumentative	 one such example comes from the exit polls of theu.
Argumentative	s. presidential election .
Argumentative	 many of the election polls predicted a win for kerry , but did n't consider the fact that republicans were less likely to respond to an exit poll leading to inaccurate conclusions about what would occur .
Argumentative	 thus , opinion polls are not necessarily trustworthy sources of information on which voters can make good decisions .
Argumentative	 tactical voting is the purposeful casting of votes to sway an outcome .
Argumentative	 when the outcome is predicted in an opinion poll , it can influence voters to possibly cast a ballot differently than had that poll information not existed .
Argumentative	 this means that the votes are being cast based upon inaccurate assumptions .
Argumentative	 for instance , in theu.
Argumentative	k. elections all polls predicted a labour victory .
Argumentative	 however , against all expectations , the conservatives won .
Argumentative	 it is wholly possible that many people , ensured of a seeming labour victory , then decided to vote for the conservatives tactically to ensure that there would be a balance in the house of commons -- or even out of sympathy , the ` underdog effect ' .
Argumentative	 or decided to vote for their first preference minor party , such as the liberal democrats , because they believed the conservatives would be voted out without their needing to cast their votes tactically for labour .
Argumentative	 thus , it is possible that the voters did n't accomplish the government they actually wanted , as they cast votes based on opinion polls .
Argumentative	 the unintended outcomes are a result of these opinion polls and tactical voting .
Argumentative	 this would ensure a more democratic discussion immediately prior to the decision making process of voting .
Argumentative	 this does not harm free expression because it is serving a specific purpose at a specific time .
Argumentative	 for instance , during times of national security or disaster certain citizen behaviour is restricted .
Argumentative	 since there is information on public opinion in all of the other weeks of the year , this two week moratorium would solve some of the harms of published opinion polls .
Argumentative	 there would be less stifling of discussion , voters would not be subjected to possibly biased information or misused statistics at this critical time of thinking and making a wise choice .
Argumentative	 tactical voting is likely to be used less , and minority voices are not as likely to be overshadowed by popularly `` claimed '' opinions .
Argumentative	 therefore , we propose that opinion polls not be publishedweeks prior to an election .
Argumentative	 when opinion polls become the constant focus of the media , politicians are forced to pander to an ever-changing public marketplace instead of developing a consistent party or personal philosophy .
Argumentative	 candidates become overly involved in defending and explaining poll data .
Argumentative	 voters become the consumers of political marketing .
Argumentative	 the democratic process is diminished when changing opinion polls interrupts substantive dialogue .
Argumentative	 without the excessive use of poll data , a candidate 's message can be more than an advertisement .
Argumentative	 rather than the marketing of a person , important political ideas and public policy discussion occur .
Argumentative	 even though poll data would be available during the earlier election season , a plan to control opinion polls would begin to diminish such a focus .
Argumentative	 the advantage would be less political marketing and room for better democratic discussion .
