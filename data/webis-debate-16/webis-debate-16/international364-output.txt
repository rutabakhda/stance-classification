Non-Argumentative	the war in the democratic republic of congo has been called ‘africa’s first world war’.
Non-Argumentative	 dr congo is a vast country in central africa, often mentioned as being ‘the size of western europe’ torn by civil war and subject to repeated intervention by neighbouring states in the period 1997-2003.
Non-Argumentative	 it has really been a succession of wars with the first congo war being fought to overthrow the dictator mobutu sese seko in 1996/7.
Non-Argumentative	 a second war involving angola, chad, namibia, zimbabwe, uganda, rwanda, and burundi, as well as possibly sudan, and aboutdifferent armed groups lasted fromto 2003.
Non-Argumentative	 there have also been several ongoing conflicts that have not yet fully ended; one comparatively minor conflict in the north west at dongo and another in the west in kivu.
Non-Argumentative	 the total number of deaths was estimated as being at least 3.5 million inwhile init was being reported that the conflict was continuing to kill about 45,000 each month, mostly children.
Non-Argumentative	as a conflict that has been ongoing for such a long time the congolese wars have been a severe test for the united nations and its peacekeeping system as they have clearly failed in either creating, or keeping the peace.
Non-Argumentative	 the mandate of the un mission has changed more than six times since novemberwhile trying to match political aims with the needs on the ground.
Non-Argumentative	 the mission now has slightly over000 troops, close to the total authorised inof 22,000, but this force is trying to police a huge area.
Non-Argumentative	 it also has a diverse mission to provide stability, protection for civilians and to support “the consolidation of state authority throughout the territory”.
Non-Argumentative	it now seems that the united nations may be on the brink of success.
Non-Argumentative	 peacekeepers usually stand back and attempt to keep the peace, they are not meant to go on the offensive, although they will fight back if fired on, however this changed in early 2013.
Non-Argumentative	 un security council resolution“decides to extend the mandate of monusco in the drc untilmarch 2014, [to] include an “intervention brigade”… with the responsibility of neutralizing armed groups… and the objective of contributing to reducing the threat posed by armed groups to state authority and civilian security in eastern drc and to make space for stabilization activities”.
Non-Argumentative	 the un was for the first time to go on the offensive.
Non-Argumentative	now it seems that this might have been a successful strategy.
Non-Argumentative	 the rebel group that the un and the congolese army were targeting is m23, the biggest remaining rebel force who succeeded in taking the city of goma in november 2012, which the government now claims they have defeated.
Non-Argumentative	 a government spokesperson has said "we can say that it's finished.
Non-Argumentative	 but you never know.
Non-Argumentative	 those who escaped can come with hit-and-run operations so we have to end everything politically so that we are sure our people can sleep quietly without any threat."
Non-Argumentative	 m23 has said that it will now adopt “purely political means” to achieve its goals.
Non-Argumentative	 this gives the government the opportunity to demand that other groups give up – and threaten to disarm them by force if they don’t.
Non-Argumentative	the us special envoy, russell feingold, says “in a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction.”
Non-Argumentative	 but will it actually be the end?
Non-Argumentative	 clearly there are more rebels in eastern congo and feingold himself is suggesting that the next target should be the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda (fdlr) and we have seen before that conflict can flare up again in this volatile country.
Non-Argumentative	even if the conflict has been won it can be questioned whether the un mission has been a success.
Non-Argumentative	 success means more than just defeating a rebellion in battle; it also has to mean creating a sustainable climate that will enable peace to continue and the un mission to be withdrawn.
