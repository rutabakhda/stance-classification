Non-Argumentative	the exchange of personal sexual services for economic rewards has a long history.
Non-Argumentative	 it is important to distinguish different kinds of markets in sexual services in order to determine the appropriate societal response.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, markets in sexual services that involve coerced sex, children, fraud and deception, and, in general, non-consensual and egregiously exploitative sexual or labor practices, are immoral and should be restricted.
Non-Argumentative	 theorists often use the terms “human trafficking,” “sex trafficking,” or “sexual slavery” to describe such practices, and the service providers in these practices have the status of a victim or slave.
Non-Argumentative	there are markets in sexual services that do not appear to involve forced labor or sex, and in which the workers seem reasonably well compensated.
Non-Argumentative	 debates over prostitution often focus on the issue of whether genuinely voluntary markets can exist or whether markets in sexual services are inherently coercive, oppressive, and harmful to the individuals who participate, as well as to non-involved third parties.
Non-Argumentative	prostitutes are highly stigmatized for the work they do, and those who condemn this work believe that it is shameful and immoral, and has no place in a just social order.
Non-Argumentative	 others believe it is a necessary evil, in that if men (primarily) could not satisfy their sexual urges through some form of commoditized sexual service, these urges would find a more socially disruptive outlet.
Non-Argumentative	  some feminists argue that prostitution is a relic from older patriarchal societies in which men’s access to the bodies of subordinates was a privilege and expression of men’s social power.
Non-Argumentative	 many contemporary “sex workers” (a term coined by prostitutes’ rights activists) report that their clients have various motives, but primarily to seek relief from loneliness or to have uncomplicated sex.
Non-Argumentative	 these sex workers believe that they are providing a valuable and morally permissible service to their clients and, by earning a living doing valuable work, they are making a contribution to their societies.
Non-Argumentative	 in short, women (and men) who offer their labor in various types of sex trades believe that the stigma that attaches to them and their work is unfair and undeserved.
Non-Argumentative	the appropriate societal response to human trafficking and slavery is abolition.
Non-Argumentative	 the abolitionist approach criminalizes only the activities of the client and others who profit from sex trafficking, but not the provider of sexual services.
Non-Argumentative	 providers are treated as victims whom others exploit by luring them into sex trades.
Non-Argumentative	 for sex markets not involving forced labor or sex, there are three standard approaches: prohibition, legalisation, and decriminalisation.
Non-Argumentative	 the prohibitionist approach criminalizes the activities of the provider, client, and other persons who profit from sex market transactions.
Non-Argumentative	 the legalization approach tolerates sex markets and businesses, but restricts them in ways that are specific to this industry.
Non-Argumentative	 regulations may include mandatory std testing or condom use, zoning restrictions, special licencing requirements for businesses, government registration of workers, restrictions on advertising, and minimum age restrictions for providers and customers.
Non-Argumentative	 the decriminalization approach seeks to remove both criminal and special regulatory restrictions and to regulate markets in sex in ways that are common for non-sex businesses.
Non-Argumentative	the abolitionist approach collapses sex trafficking and prostitution together, as proponents generally believe that few workers enter sex markets voluntarily, and those who do are not acting in their best interest.
Non-Argumentative	  the decriminalization approach typically recognizes the need for some special regulation (at least those appropriate to adult businesses, such as liquor stores), but proponents often oppose the regulatory schemes currently in use (especially, registration and mandatory health exams for workers).
Non-Argumentative	  for the sake of argument, this debate assumes that some service providers enter sex markets voluntarily and with a rational assessment of their interests, and that some special regulation is necessary even if we have not yet come up with the best scheme.
Argumentative	  therefore this debate will focus on legalization verses prohibition.
Argumentative	criminalizing the acts of selling and buying sexual services does not protect those who sell or buy such services , but rather pushes these activities underground .
Argumentative	 while market exchanges of sexual services involve some risk-taking , the risks are increased and compounded when such markets are prohibited .
Argumentative	 when selling and buying sex is illegal , those participating in these exchanges can not , or simply do not , seek the protection of the law when their rights are violated .
Argumentative	 because crimes against sex workers or their clients are often unreported , and when reported often not investigated , predators and rights violators can take advantage of others without fear of arrest and punishment .
Argumentative	 moreover , because criminalization forces sex work into remote and invisible corners of society , sellers and buyers are less able to insure their safety and protection .
Argumentative	 for these reasons , laws criminalizing sex markets amplify the risks sellers and buyers face when they participate in sex market transactions .
Argumentative	 the main purpose of criminalizing sex markets is to protect those who enter such markets from harm .
Argumentative	 yet the harms of paying or accepting money for a good that can be legally exchanged for free are far less than the harms that result from the rights violations that often occur , robbery , battery , sexual assault , murder , when sex markets are pushed underground .
Argumentative	 while many societies have attempted to restrict sex to marriage , few , if any , have succeeded .
Argumentative	 in contemporary , secular liberal societies , adults are no longer punished for pursuing sex outside of marriage .
Argumentative	 many adults find non-marital sex satisfying , healthy , and fulfilling , whether it occurs in the context of an ongoing romantic relationship , a casual friendship , or a market exchange .
Argumentative	 while many people will never seek the services of a sex worker , those who do are often seeking sensual comfort , companionship , entertainment , and fantasy fulfilment .
Argumentative	 while the latter goods are often obtainable in non-market relationships , some people prefer the convenience and efficiency of market mechanisms for securing these goods .
Argumentative	 in a liberal society , individuals are free to pursue their own vision of happiness , as long as they respect the moral and civil rights of others .
Argumentative	 markets that provide sexual services enable some individuals to secure goods essential to their happiness .
Argumentative	 those who provide services to these individuals can do so in a manner that respects their rights and dignity , if the markets are legal and well regulated .
Argumentative	 sexual autonomy means being able to control when , where , and with whom one has sexual relations .
Argumentative	 it also means that , at any moment , one may withdraw from a sexual relationship or encounter .
Argumentative	 spouses , lovers , and also strangers have the right to sexual autonomy .
Argumentative	 if an adult chooses to engage in sex with other adults who offer material benefits , her right to sexual autonomy is respected as long as she has control over when , where , and with which clients she has sexual relations , and as long as she is mentally competent and is allowed to terminate the agreement at any time .
Argumentative	 if markets in sex were to become legal , the rights of providers , and clients , to sexual autonomy would need to be respected .
Argumentative	 this means that sex workers would maintain the right to refuse service to any customer , and to discontinue service or employment at any time and for any reason .
Argumentative	 like other workers , sexual service providers would have the right to a safe and healthy work place .
Argumentative	 workers who are drug dependent , or otherwise incompetent or highly vulnerable in the work place , would need to be provided treatment and time off work until they were capable of protecting themselves and others .
Argumentative	 removing criminal penalties from the sale or purchase of sexual services , and regulating sex markets so that they protect participants and non-involved third parties , would be socially beneficial .
Argumentative	 in particular , sex enterprises and businesses could be made safer for workers , clients , and the communities in which they operated .
Argumentative	 by allowing sex businesses to operate openly , providers , clients , and business owners can become law-abiding , productive citizens , who contribute to their communities .
Argumentative	 sex businesses and workers would pay taxes , and other licensing fees .
Argumentative	 business owners would be expected to comply with standard business laws and regulations .
Argumentative	 moreover , the government could enact special regulations appropriate to this industry , such as age restrictions on workers and clients , and mandatory condom use .
Argumentative	 the resources that are currently allocated to arrest , prosecute , and incarcerate sex workers and clients could be reallocated for better uses .
Argumentative	 for example , these resources could be used to better address the sexual abuse of minors , sexual assault , substance abuse , mental health problems , and the many public and individual needs that go unmet .
Argumentative	 some markets in sex should be blocked .
Argumentative	 markets that involve child labor , forced labor or sex , and forced migration and detention , should be stopped and those who organize and profit from such markets should be prosecuted .
Argumentative	 as with any service , it is critically important that no one is forced to work or to continue working , either through the threat of harm or through fraud and deception .
Argumentative	 it is also critically important that children are protected from sexual predators , and are excluded from all aspects of sex businesses .
Argumentative	 forced labor and child sexual abuse involve violations of basic human rights that all societies are expected to protect .
Argumentative	 voluntary , adult sex work is significantly different from trafficking , and law enforcers need to distinguish market exchanges involving consensual sex among adults from market exchanges involving forced sex among adults or involving minors .
Argumentative	 by legalizing voluntary , adult sex work , law enforcers and rights protectors could focus their efforts on eliminating markets that involve the sexual abuse of adults or children .
Argumentative	 additionally , clients of sex business would have the choice of patronizing legal business , and therefore would be less likely to patronize inadvertently a business that relies on forced or child labor .
