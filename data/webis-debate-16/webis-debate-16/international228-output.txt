Non-Argumentative	the role that the developed world should play on the international stage has been a constant battle throughout its history between those that favour isolationism and those that favour a more engaged overseas policy.
Non-Argumentative	 from the early nineteenth-century european powers set out an imperialist project to 'humanise' the 'less advanced' peripheral countries of africa, asia and south america1.
Non-Argumentative	 by way of contrast, 'splendid isolation' was the policy adopted by imperial britain in the late nineteenth-century under the government of disraeli and the marquis of salisbury whereby they did not intervene in the affairs of other countries unless it absolutely involved great britain; this inevitably meant a withdrawal from the practice of promoting the 'humanising' political system, at least in europe2.
Non-Argumentative	 these two policies embody the different attitudes to foreign policy among world powers.
Non-Argumentative	in the new millennium however, what democracy promotion means and implies is a very important issue with many far reaching consequences.
Non-Argumentative	 traditionally developed countries have supported democracy promotion through aid programs and development assistance.
Non-Argumentative	 as key stakeholders in multilateral institutions such as the world bank, imf and world trade organization, developed countries are in a strong position (some say too strong a position) to attach democratic conditions to aid and trade deals, should it so wish.
Non-Argumentative	 propaganda and other such soft, persuasive methods are more popular as they are seen as being less intrusive.
Non-Argumentative	 however, with the recent wars in iraq, afghanistan and libya the use of military force to promote democracy has entered into the debate as well.
Non-Argumentative	the question is, should countries be pressured to conform to what is simply the current predominant mode of government in the western world?
Argumentative	 or is democracy an inherently superior system that we should strive to see implemented across the globe?
Argumentative	the primary justification for democracy promotion is the democratic peace theory .
Argumentative	 the theory of the democratic peace goes back to immanuel kant 's essay ` perpetual peace ' , which he published in; perpetual peace refers to a state of affairs where peace is permanently established over a certain area , as the roman and british empires attempted to do during their respective periods of dominance in history .
Argumentative	 kant 's theory was that the majority of people would never go to war , unless in self-defence2 .
Argumentative	 democracies tend not to go to war as often as other countries because their military is more directly under civilian control .
Argumentative	 authoritarian governments or those heavily underpinned by their respective armies , by contrast , have no such barriers to whimsical invasions of other countries , nor the use of the national army to suppress their own people in a bid to solidify power .
Argumentative	 communist north korea is just one example of a country whose foreign policy is extremely aggressive as a direct result of its political inclinations3 .
Argumentative	 therefore if all countries were democracies there would be no wars as there would be no aggressors .
Argumentative	 given the peaceful nature of democratic states , it is clearly in the interest of the usa to promote democratic change worldwide .
Argumentative	 democracy is a universal value which knows no cultural boundaries .
Argumentative	 the universal declaration of human rights states that `` everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ``.
Argumentative	 it is a fallacy to suggest that we should excuse countries from this clause because their culture seems to preach otherwise .
Argumentative	 the principles of democracy are something that everyone is entitled to simply because they are right and fair .
Argumentative	 democracy should not be reserved as a privilege for those who happen to be born in a culture that already supports it ; we must endeavour to make all countries believe in the veracity of this declaration .
Argumentative	 democracy is good for the worldwide economy , as its values of openness and accountability promote the rule of law and good governance in the people 's interest .
Argumentative	 the threat that the electorate will not re-elect them at the next election forces governments to adopt social and economic policies which will make their citizens richer and more secure .
Argumentative	 in practice this means creating open markets friendly to inward investment and eager for trade , while reining in corruption , military spending and aggressive foreign policies .
Argumentative	 china is a good example here .
Argumentative	 of course it is by no means democratic , but in order to continue its economic boom it has over the last ten years had to open up its business practices to the world .
Argumentative	 integration into the world economy , for example , joining the wto , has led to greater transparency1 .
Argumentative	 because encouraging such policies is clearly in the economic interests of all current democracies , they should actively seek to promote democracy abroad as the best way to achieve wealth .
Argumentative	 `` everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person ``, `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ``and `` everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country , directly or through freely chosen representatives ``are three of the most fundamental tenets of democratic society .
Argumentative	 the vote ensures that public expression can take place peacefully , instead of violently .
Argumentative	 free speech provides a legitimate avenue through which to address the government and ease tensions in society that could potentially turn violent .
Argumentative	 for these reasons , democracies tend not to suppress their people using violence , as in the case of the tiananmen square incident in communist china4 or with the `` tulip revolution '' in authoritarian kyrgystan5 .
Argumentative	 in fact , democracies tend to have constitutions , which ensure the government can not violently suppress peaceful dissent , and must always honour the beliefs of the majority of its people .
Argumentative	 everyone should have a right to live without fear of suppression and with the ability to voice their opinions and beliefs .
Argumentative	 because such values are written deep within the heart of the democracies , our governments should seek to export them wherever possible abroad .
Argumentative	 if western democracies are to live up to their calling as `` shining beacons '' for all mankind , it should seek to promote democratization as the best means of improving human well-being around the world .
