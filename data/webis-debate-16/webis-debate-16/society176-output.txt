Non-Argumentative	despite launching as recently asfacebook has quickly become the biggest social network on the internet.
Non-Argumentative	 it has more than a billion members of whom half log in daily.
Non-Argumentative	 it is one of the biggest companies in the world with its market value passing $100 billion in the summer of 2013.
Non-Argumentative	(1) without any doubt, is has had a tremendous effect upon its users, the question is if itâ€™s beneficial or not.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents argue that it enhances socialization and serves as a platform to spread information among numerous individuals while opponents believe its very existence is detrimental to children making them more prone to anxiety and depression.
Non-Argumentative	 early in 2013, reports suggested that facebook lost nine million active monthly users in the u.s and two million in britain, showing that many think that facebook now has too much of a negative impact on their lives.
Argumentative	with facebook being the social network of choice for so many and having an immense amount of influence over how we interact the question of whether the social network is beneficial is of vital importance.
Argumentative	one of the most crucial elements in any child 's development is the ability to socialize with peers .
Argumentative	 by having a large circle of friends to talk to and share interests , the child gains trust , self-esteem and self-confidence .
Argumentative	 if you have people to talk to when you have a problem , it is much easier to overcome any problems .
Argumentative	 facebook and social networks in general help teenagers on multiple levels to maintain and expand their circle of friends .
Argumentative	 firstly , it lets you remain in touch with friends even if you are very far apart .
Argumentative	 as we live in an increasingly globalized world , friend circles tend to be broken up very easily .
Argumentative	 as a result , individuals need to be able to keep in touch in spite of the physical distance .
Argumentative	 facebook enables them to do that .
Argumentative	  secondly , by allowing people with shared opinions , hobbies or interests to gather , social networks allow users to expand their circle of friends , something that is more applicable the bigger the social network .
Argumentative	 thirdly , it allows young people to spend more time with the friends and people they already know through chat conversations , shared photos or status updates .
Argumentative	 as a result , people who are engaged on these social networks have more self esteem , more confidence in them , feel more appreciated and tend to be happier in general due to their wide circle of friends .
Argumentative	  undoubtedly , one of the most important aspects which will influence your efforts to improve your life is your ability to take advantage of every opportunity which comes up .
Argumentative	 obviously , one of the , if not the , best way to do this is to stay connected with the world around you , this enables you to be able to quickly find out about job opportunities , sporting competitions or social events in your area .
Argumentative	 facebook created and developed an efficient , extremely widely visited platform on which millions of users can get in touch with each other .
Argumentative	 this can prove to be an extremely useful tool both for companies or event planners and direct customers .
Argumentative	 no matter if we are talking about google 's new hiring policy or toyota 's new discount , an upcoming music festival or a football tournament for amateur players , facebook is informing the individuals about these events , keeping them connected with their community .
Argumentative	 social networks are more efficient to serving this purpose than other more conventional means like tv commercials because it is free .
Argumentative	 a very good example of this is the konycampaign , which informed the people about the atrocities that happened in uganda at the time , mainly relying only on social media .
Argumentative	 the youtube video telling its story has more thanmillion views and also there were more posts on facebook about kony on march 6th and 7th than even apple 's new ipad or tv releases .
Argumentative	  no matter if we talk about tv ads , radio commercials or billboards , the price that has to be paid in order to promote an event is a big drawback for anyone who wants to inform the population .
Argumentative	 as a result , facebook as with other social media is the online , cheap , efficient equivalent to an info point .
Argumentative	 social networks aid our society on multiple levels , one of them being the democratic process .
Argumentative	 this happens both in autocracies , where the democratic process is basically nonexistent and in western liberal democracies where facebook acts as a megaphone for the will of the population .
Argumentative	 firstly , when talking about oppressive regimes , facebook allows the population to organize themselves in massive protests which can , in time , overthrow the government .
Argumentative	 this is of particular importance as the population can not organize protests `` offline '' in the real world , because government forces would quickly find them and stop the protests before they even started .
Argumentative	 these people need a safe house , where government intervention is minimized , so that they can spread the news and organize the protests .
Argumentative	 the online environment is the best options .
Argumentative	 we have seen this happening in the arab spring  , brazil  , turkey  as well as for protests in democracies as in wisconsin  for western liberal democracies too facebook plays a very important role in aiding the democratic process .
Argumentative	 even in a democracy the government often engages in unpopular policies .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , as we are talking about countries with tens of millions of people , citizens often feel they ca n't make a difference .
Argumentative	 luckily , here 's where facebook comes in .
Argumentative	 it connects all the people who share the same disapproval of government actions , removing the feeling that you can do nothing as there is no one backing you .
Argumentative	 millions can come together to voice their opinions .
Argumentative	 therefore there is more likely to be dissent .
Argumentative	 moreover , the internet allowed individuals to start massive campaigns of online petition gathering , which they will later use as an irrefutable argument to the government showing the desire for change .
Argumentative	 there are a lot of sites , one of the biggest being avaaz.org which facilitates this process , which use facebook as a medium through which the petition is shared and so grows .
