Non-Argumentative	the united states has suffered from racial disparity even before it was a nation, and the lasting effects of institutions of racism are still apparent in society today.
Non-Argumentative	 in 1954, the supreme court ruled that segregated public schools are unconstitutional because they disadvantage african-american students.
Non-Argumentative	 today, however, the education system continues to fail to properly serve black students, who consistently perform lower and are more likely to drop out than their white peers.1 some in the education community have argued that african-american males might be better served by one-race, one-sex schools.
Non-Argumentative	 they argue that racial separation is not racist if it is carefully designed to benefit a disadvantaged minority.
Argumentative	 opponents argue that, while intentions might be good, this is simply another form of the segregation that has done american society so much damage.1 sharon lewis, candace simon, renatauzzell, amanda horwitz, michael casserly, "a call for change: the social and educational factors contributing to the outcomes of black males in urban schools," the council of the great city schools, october 2010, 3.
Argumentative	schools in the us focus primarily on european history and a version of american history that does not adequately cover african-american history .
Argumentative	 a few experimental schools with all black students have incorporated an `` afrocentric '' curriculum , which focuses more on african history than european history and places a greater emphasis on the role of african-americans in united states history .1 when students learn history as something that includes them , rather than the story of some other people , they are more likely to be engaged in the subject matter as they have a personal connection to the history , they will be learning their own history not someone else 's .1 ibid ,.
Argumentative	 even though the state requires mandatory education , the constitution respects the right of free choice and free association : catholics , for example , are free to attend schools with all-catholic populations , and girls can go to schools that serve only girls .
Argumentative	 the result is that students are allowed to attend the schools that serve them best .
Argumentative	 but this should not be a privilege given only to those who can afford private schooling .
Argumentative	 public school students , too , deserve options that serve them - and those options should include single-sex , single-race schools .
Argumentative	 equality under the law does not mean sameness .
Argumentative	 in mainstream schools which track students by ability , as many as 1/3 of black male students are incorrectly placed in slower classes .1 these lower-end classes are often assigned the worst teachers , reserving the better teachers for a school 's honor classes .2 consequently , black males are often prevented from receiving an equal education in integrated schools .
Argumentative	 allowing black males to be educated in an environment isolated from racial tensions and inequalities eliminates the psychological impact of `` tracking '' in integrated public schools .

Argumentative	 despite almost sixty years of integration , black students lag behind whites , and the difference is even greater for males .1 onlypercent of black fourth-grade boys are proficient in reading , compared withpercent of white boys , and onlypercent of black eighth-grade boys are proficient in math , compared withpercent of white boys .2 figures that are not explained just by poverty .
Argumentative	 the idyllic image of integrated schools does not line up to reality ; black males are still at great risk for dropping out of school , being imprisoned and murdered at rates several times higher than young white men .
Argumentative	 there is evidence to show that this alternative school system may benefit its students ; educators should not reject the opportunity without giving it a fair chance .

Argumentative	 2gabriel ,in the us , black males are at a higher risk for murder , drug use , and imprisonment than any other group - they are 6.5 times more likely to be imprisoned than white males .1 they are disproportionately affected by drug use , violence , single parenting , poverty , racial profiling , and other factors that alienate them from society .2 education specialists argue that because black males currently perform worse than any other group in school , teachers assume their black male students will be low performers and treat them differently .3 this treatment causes these students to accept defeat before they have been given a chance to show their potential .
Argumentative	 an educational environment that is specially designed to push black male students to succeed and take pride in their identity would eliminate the feeling of inferiority which integrated schools often impose .
Argumentative	 this means that all-black , all-male schools which are publicly funded are needed in order to directly address the needs of african-american male students in modern society .
Argumentative	 this does not mean that black males should be compelled to attend these schools , and , while this argument focuses on black males , the proposition is amenable to schools which address the needs of other minorities and minority females .
