Non-Argumentative	the way that the rushdie issue has been handled by the indian government is shameful, and is representative of how all political parties in india pander to right-wing religious agendas just before any election (in this case, the up state elections starting in mid-february).
Non-Argumentative	 however, i feel that if a battle has to be fought for the right to freedom of expression, then the soldiers fighting that battle need to display some more courage than rushdie and the organisers of the festival managed to muster.
Non-Argumentative	 it was clear from the very outset that there was no credible threat to rushdie’s life, and that the security needed for his personal safety could have easily been arranged.
Non-Argumentative	 even though there was a real risk of the festival being disrupted by protesters, this was a risk which the organisers and rushdie should have taken in order to defend the sanctity of the right to freedom of speech.
Non-Argumentative	 by cancelling not just the visit, but also the video link, the organisers and rushdie have further emboldened the fanatical elements in india and sent them the message that these kind of scare tactics are indeed an effective way of pressurising people into silence.
Non-Argumentative	this issue is said to have ‘divided muslims from westerners along the fault line of culture’ and pits the western value of freedom of expression against the view of many muslims that nobody should be permitted to insult or malign the muslim faith.
Argumentative	 society has a right to choose and structure its values as it sees fit and there is no reason why the western construction of values is right or should take priority over any other .
Argumentative	 in muslim countries faith may be a more important aspect of life that it might be in western countries and it is entirely legitimate that those societies might choose to value protecting the dignity of their faith over absolute freedom of speech .
Argumentative	 india 's post-independence history is one of partition along religious grounds with pakistan and then open warfare with that state over territory .
Argumentative	 there is still a large muslim minority in india and there are deep underlying social tensions within the country on this basis , along with frosty relations with a nuclear-capable pakistan .
Argumentative	 in this context , india 's leaders have a special reason to pay attention to the sensibilities of their minority populations .
Argumentative	 if allowing the publication of the satanic verses would result in social unrest then on the balance of harms it is a rational choice to make a limited restriction on freedom of speech rather than see potential millions having their property and lives threatened .
