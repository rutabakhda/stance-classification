Non-Argumentative	the drive to control all references to the olympic games is part of a global creep of intellectual property law that has led to a "right of association", writes teresa scassa.
Non-Argumentative	it is not surprising that the uk laws are among the most sweeping seen thus far; there is a general trend towards broader and more extensive anti-ambush marketing legislation from one olympic event to the next.
Non-Argumentative	 it is worth noting that when the law was debated in parliament, the minister for sport expressly admitted that the “right of association” was drafted in the broadest possible terms because there was no consensus as to what type of conduct it was meant to catch and because the future demands of the ioc for a legal response might change.
Non-Argumentative	major event organisers will insist that anti-ambush marketing laws are necessary to ensure fiscal success.
Non-Argumentative	 complex events such as the olympics have elaborate sponsorship regimes ranging from top sponsors to a web of official suppliers of particular wares or services.
Non-Argumentative	 top sponsors pay millions of dollars for sponsorship rights, and organisers maintain that these revenues are essential to properly fund the event.
Non-Argumentative	 the sponsor who pays such substantial sums of money wants a guarantee that the exclusivity they have paid for is respected; they do not want their competitors to be able to leverage the public excitement or interest around the event for their own purposes and without paying for the right to do so.
Non-Argumentative	“ambush marketing” is a term developed in business circles to describe a range of opportunistic marketing practices that have long been a major irritant for event sponsors.
Non-Argumentative	 an ambush marketer runs an advertising campaign that creates an association between their product and the major event.
Non-Argumentative	 it is not necessary for the advertiser to create confusion as to their status as a sponsor; it is the mental association the consumer makes with an event that is considered problematic.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, when visa was the sponsor of the barcelona olympics, a rival credit card company launched a series of ads that exhorted consumers to remember “that you don’t need a visa to visit spain”.
Non-Argumentative	 ambush marketing has been difficult to stop using traditional ip laws because ambushers are careful not to use the trademarks of either their rivals or the event itself.
Non-Argumentative	 although some argue that there is an unfair competition dimension to such activities, the actual harm is elusive.
Non-Argumentative	 it is not clear that consumers are confused about who is a sponsor and who is not; nor is it clear that consumers make choices based on sponsorship status.
Non-Argumentative	 it is also difficult to establish that the value of sponsorships is tied to the existence of this kind of legislative protection.
Non-Argumentative	 by contrast, research suggests that the value of a sponsorship is more closely tied to the sponsor’s own efforts to leverage the association for which they have paid through effective advertising campaigns.
Non-Argumentative	yet in spite of the existence of anti-ambush marketing laws, ambush marketing by the major competitors of event sponsors remains common.
Non-Argumentative	 major corporations have easy access to legal departments that can find the loopholes to effectively exploit in advertising campaigns.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, in the case of the vancouverwinter olympics, competitors of major sponsors determined that the legislation against ambush marketing did not limit displays of national pride.
Non-Argumentative	 they launched high profile advertising campaigns that played on this theme (go canada!)
Non-Argumentative	 to get their piece of the olympic spotlight.
Non-Argumentative	 while major corporations will find ways around legislation, it is the small and local businesses that are most directly affected.
Non-Argumentative	 the local restaurant that offers gold, silver or bronze breakfast specials during the olympics will be among those least able to fight the cease and desist letter they will inevitably receive.
Non-Argumentative	by creating property-like rights in major events, governments have further shrunk the already embattled public domain and have contributed once again to the creeping propertisation of just about anything.
Non-Argumentative	 major events are multi-stakeholder public spectacles.
Non-Argumentative	 there is something fundamentally important about the ability of these stakeholders – governments, community members, local businesses, taxpayers, citizens, athletes and amateur sporting organisations – to make reference to a public event that involves and impacts them in various ways.
Argumentative	 by aiming to control event-related narratives in public and commercial spaces, ambush marketing legislation places a chill upon expression that extends far beyond what is genuinely needed to protect the value of sponsorships.
Argumentative	nobody would challenge the right of sponsors to proudly promote their bought association with an event they are sponsoring and to use all of the means at their disposal to declare that association to the world , which they have done .
Argumentative	 however , there is a world of difference between the positive right to proclaim a particular association and the negative right to prevent anyone else from proclaiming theirs .
Argumentative	 of course sponsorship should provide bragging rights and privileged access but that is a world away from buying the silence of others .
Argumentative	 smaller businesses and other organisations see their freedom of expression worst hit by laws that prevent them from associating themselves in any way with major events , to the detriment of their communities .
Argumentative	 free speech is not relative or conditional and certainly should not be determined on the basis of the thickness of someone 's chequebook .
Argumentative	 in this regard , freedom of information is a very real issue .
Argumentative	 those organisations without access to huge legal departments are hardest hit , further disadvantaging them against corporations who can already outspend them on advertising .
Argumentative	 free speech means that in the world of words and ideas , at least , there is an even playing field and undermining that runs against a sense of natural justice .
Argumentative	 sponsors are simply using this to increase an already fairly unfair advantage ; many people supported britain 's bid for the games on the basis that it would offer great benefits to local businesses , legislation restricting their ability to use their geographical and cultural association with the event make that pledge look extremely hollow .
Argumentative	 the major sponsors already went into this situation with massive advantages over small traders who had the sole advantage of the geographical proximity to the events .
Argumentative	 the idea that , for example , coca cola can prevent street vendors in the olympic village from selling pepsi is absurd .
Argumentative	 coke is n't planning to make their money back on direct sales of their product around venues but on the prestige it brings them as a global brand .
Argumentative	 the idea that corporations can , effectively , buy words and phrases set a pernicious precedent similar to their ability to own genes .
Argumentative	 there are certain things that , self-evidently , are the property of the people .
Argumentative	 they are held in common and in trust for future generations .
Argumentative	 they can not be sold because they are not owned .
Argumentative	 attempts to evade that reality have , generally , been seen as pernicious by history -- even where they have not been rectified .
Argumentative	 european settlers laying claim to land used by indigenous people would be one example .
Argumentative	 who can reasonably be said to own , for example , the phrase `` london'' ?
Argumentative	 if anybody could make such a claim , londoners living in the city inwould seem to be the obvious answer .
Argumentative	 however , there is a far more satisfying answer that nobody does .
Argumentative	 the fact that this is happening in relation to the olympics makes the precedent particularly troubling as the idea that the games are for all mankind is at the heart of the olympic ideal .
Argumentative	 it is an aspiration of our common humanity and all that entails .
Argumentative	 if chunks of that are for sale then it raises very real concerns about what else could go under the hammer .
