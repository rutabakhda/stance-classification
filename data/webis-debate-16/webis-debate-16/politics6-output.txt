Non-Argumentative	 because of the deep seriousness of this guarantee, new members can only join nato if they are prepared to fully commit to collective security, and if all the existing member states vote to extend the guarantee to them.
Non-Argumentative	by the collapse of communism in the late 1980s most of the western european democracies and turkey had joined nato, although some including ireland, switzerland, sweden and finland remain neutral to this day.
Non-Argumentative	 the end of the cold war brought the collapse of both the warsaw pact and of communism, and the future of nato in the absence of these former threats seemed uncertain.
Non-Argumentative	 the alliance continued, however, intervening in the balkans in the 1990s and undertaking a peacekeeping role in afghanistan following thecampaign against the taliban.
Non-Argumentative	 it also continued to expand, taking in newly democratic former warsaw pact members such as poland, hungary and romania.
Non-Argumentative	 this expansion led nato into friction with moscow, which resented its former client states becoming american allies, in spite of informal western promises to gorbachev not to expand nato to these states,  and hosting advanced weapons systems which it feared could be turned against russia.
Non-Argumentative	 most offensive to russia, however, was theentry into nato of latvia, lithuania and estonia, three baltic states which had once been part of the soviet union itself.
Non-Argumentative	 despite russian protests the baltic countries were accepted into nato and their forces integrated into its military structure.
Non-Argumentative	nato membership greatly appeals to the newly democratic states of central and eastern europe, who remain wary of russia and keen to associate themselves with western democracy and prosperity.

Non-Argumentative	 in most of georgia opinion is more united, but two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia have resisted rule from tbilisi and managed their own affairs under russian patronage.
Non-Argumentative	at its bucharest conference in the spring of 2008, the united states urged its allies to offer georgia and ukraine membership action plans (maps) but was unable to persuade all of its european partners to do so.
Non-Argumentative	 georgia and ukraine were, however, given assurances that they would one day be welcomed into nato; assurances which went down badly in moscow.
Non-Argumentative	 in augustevents came to a head when georgia took military action in south ossetia and russia quickly sent troops into the enclave.
Non-Argumentative	 the american-trained georgian army was rapidly routed and russia gained military control of both breakaway regions, and abkhazia and south ossetia declared their independence.
Non-Argumentative	 although few other states have recognised their independence, the episode raised fears of a new cold war and called into question the wisdom of offering georgia and ukraine nato membership.
Non-Argumentative	sincethere has been no progress in bringing georgia and ukraine into nato.
Non-Argumentative	 ukraine made a turn towards russia inwhen it elected president yanukovych leading the country to no longer pursue nato membership while in georgia too there have been attempts to reestablish friendships with russia.
Non-Argumentative	 however inyanukovych was ousted in a pro-western revolution.
Non-Argumentative	 russia occupied crimea in events that are superficially very similar to theevents in georgia.
Non-Argumentative	 such action show the threat that russia poses to ukraine and potentially reopens the question of whether ukraine should join nato.

Argumentative	 in georgia a non-binding referendum on whether to join nato showed% of voters in favor of joining .
Argumentative	 polls show that some% of ukrainians insaid that would support ukraine 's membership in nato if a referendum on this issue were held .
Argumentative	 both states are at risk of being pushed around by russia , partly because their desire to adopt `` western '' democratic values is at odds with the more autocratic values of russia 's leadership .
Argumentative	 they also fear that russia has designs on their territory and sovereignty , knowing that many in the russian elite have never fully accepted the collapse of the old soviet union .
Argumentative	 these fears have been realised with russian forces in south ossetia , abkhazia , and crimea .
Argumentative	 joining nato offers georgia and ukraine the protection of a proven alliance and a clear route to european union membership that has already been travelled by other former soviet states .
Argumentative	 ukraine and georgia as european states have a right to join nato if they would satisfy all criteria for nato membership .
Argumentative	 expansion to include georgia and ukraine is in the interests of nato .
Argumentative	 after more than a decade without a clear role , the alliance now once again stands for the principle of solidarity between western liberal democracies .

Argumentative	 russia once again poses a threat to europe and needs to be contained or at least shown that nato has not forgotten about it .
Argumentative	 this is shown by president putin 's continuing lashing out at foreign countries for funding ngos and plans to boost defense spending .
Argumentative	 extending nato up to russia 's southern border will signal the west 's strength and determination and force russia to respect the alliance and its members .
Argumentative	 there is a strong precedent for letting ukraine and georgia join nato .
Argumentative	 latvia , lithuania and estonia are also former soviet states , and russia objected to their entry into nato quite as much as it objects today about its black sea neighbours .
Argumentative	 yet russia was not allowed a veto over their futures , and it soon got over its annoyance , continuing to participate in joint forums with nato and to cooperate with the usa over afghanistan , north korea and nuclear non-proliferation .
Argumentative	 so nato is already committed to the defence of states in russia 's near-abroad , and should not fear further expansion .
