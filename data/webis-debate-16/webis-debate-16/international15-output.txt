Non-Argumentative	 a nation that spreads over a territory ofmillion square miles with a diverse historical background and with a population of even more diverse cultural backgrounds, russia is by no means an easy state to manage.

Non-Argumentative	 a former kgb officer who had kept a fairly low profile in post-communist russian politics, putin emerged as a quiet yet powerful leader who was not afraid to make bold statements and take swift actions.
Non-Argumentative	 riding on a platform of fighting corruption, secession and terrorist threats, putin won the hearts and minds of disillusioned russians.
Non-Argumentative	 however, his political actions and powerful character risk turning him into more of an authoritarian leader than the elected leader of a democratic country.
Non-Argumentative	 inputin completed his second term in office, swapping roles with his former prime minister dmitry medvedev.

Argumentative	since the fall of communism , russia has plunged into a deep economic recession .
Argumentative	 the introduction of market reforms and privatization has led to a swift increase in inequalities coupled with an increase in corruption .
Argumentative	 the chaos of economic and political reform , along with the chaos of the break-up of former ussr , has left the majority of the population both disillusioned and distrustful of their government .
Argumentative	 in a period of such chaos , stability seems to be much more important than reform .
Argumentative	 a strong leader is the only solution to providing such stability , setting a clear direction and pulling a country at risk of falling apart together again .
Argumentative	 this is also proven from various polls among the russian population -- `` ... the most eye-catching statistic is the overwhelming majority of respondents who say that order is more important for russia than democracy --per cent , withper cent responding conversely . ''

Argumentative	 russia is too big , too diverse and too thinly-populated for western systems of representative democracy to be applied .

Argumentative	 without such a ruler russia is likely to fragment with local strongmen grabbing power in the regions , religious fundamentalism dominating much of the caucasus and central asia , and economic stagnation .
