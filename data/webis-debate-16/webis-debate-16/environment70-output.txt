Non-Argumentative	dams have probably existed for about as long as humans have had agriculture, to control water flow and to use the hydraulic energy for a water mill.
Non-Argumentative	 since the 19th century, dams have also been used to convert the hydraulic energy into electricity.
Non-Argumentative	 there are several methods, but they all rely on the dam (in jargon called a hydroelectric power station) converting the energy of flowing water into electricity through a turbine and generator.
Non-Argumentative	there are all sizes of hydroelectric power stations, varying from ‘pico hydro’, which is usually just a few pipes diverting water from a river instead of a dam, to large and specialized industrial facilities.
Non-Argumentative	 the large dams generate a lot of energy but have also drawn a lot of criticism because they involve large-scale landscape restructuring.
Non-Argumentative	 this casefile takes a closer look into that debate, and ignores issues that might come into play around the smaller scale hydroelectric power stations.
Non-Argumentative	the largest hydroelectric power stations in operation as ofare the three gorges dam in china, itaipu, shared by brazil and paraguay, huri in venezuela, tcuruí in brazil and the grand coulee in the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 power from hydroelectric power stations inwas about 15% of total power production and is by far the largest renewable energy source in use, providing between 80% - 85% of total renewable energy production.
Argumentative	 hydroelectric dams burn no fossil fuels so emit no greenhouse gasses at all in producing energy .
Argumentative	 suppose we replace all coal fired power stations with hydroelectric power stations .
Argumentative	 in, over% of global electricity production was produced through coal , accounting for over% of global carbon dioxide emissions .
Argumentative	 since there is more than enough potential capacity for hydropower , we could hypothetically completely replace coal and even other fossil fuels for electricity , thus helping cut down greenhouse gas emissions massively .
Argumentative	 in, about 1.4 billion people had no access to electricity .
Argumentative	 hydropower provides a source of energy that is cheaper even than conventional coal .
Argumentative	 large dams can last for over a hundred years and are easy to switch on and off according to demand , making them very cost-effective .
Argumentative	 given that having no access to electricity makes work and study nearly impossible , alleviating global poverty by giving access to electricity is an important step to take .
Argumentative	 the large water reservoirs created by hydroelectric dams can provide facilities for water sports and can become tourist attractions themselves .
Argumentative	 the reservoirs can be used for irrigation to help farmers and can be a means for flood control .
Argumentative	 a prime example of this is the tennessee valley authority , an organisation responsible for flood control , electricity generation , economic development and even fertilizer generation in the tennessee valley in the u.s. , spanning parts of alabama , mississippi , kentucky , georgia , north carolina and virginia .
