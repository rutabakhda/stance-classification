Non-Argumentative	at the end of the cold war, believing that the nuclear threat had finally receded, much of the world breathed a collective sigh of relief.
Non-Argumentative	 victory in the cold war, however, sowed the seeds of a new threat: that of nuclear proliferation (the spread of nuclear weapons).
Non-Argumentative	 in recent years this topic has never been far from the headlines.
Non-Argumentative	 in 2003, iraq's nuclear program was given as one justification for the second gulf war.
Non-Argumentative	 in theus presidential election campaign, both president bush and senator kerry identified nuclear proliferation as the single biggest security threat facing the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 inthe international body set up to prevent proliferation, the international atomic energy authority (iaea) and its director, mohamed elbaradei, were awarded the nobel peace prize in recognition of their work.
Non-Argumentative	 the cornerstone of the international law concerning nuclear weapons is the non-proliferation treaty (npt).
Non-Argumentative	 every state in the world except india, israel, pakistan and north korea are signatories.
Non-Argumentative	 north korea was a member but withdrew in 2003.
Non-Argumentative	 under the npt, five states (china, france, russia, the uk and the us) are recognized as having the right to possess nuclear weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 these states are known as the nuclear weapon states (nws).
Non-Argumentative	 the other states, the non-nuclear weapon states (nnws), have promised not to acquire nuclear weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 in return, they have 'the inalienable right' to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Non-Argumentative	 one cause of proliferation is that civilian nuclear programs can be used to make the fuel for a nuclear bomb (the hardest part of any nuclear weapons program).
Non-Argumentative	 specifically, there are two routes for making reactor fuel: uranium enrichment (in which uranium ore is refined) and plutonium reprocessing (in which plutonium is separated from used reactor fuel).
Non-Argumentative	 however, exactly the same processes can be used to refine the product still further and make weapons-grade material.
Non-Argumentative	 the iaea was set up to monitor civilian nuclear programs and ensure that they are used for legitimate purposes.
Non-Argumentative	 the iaea inspects nuclear facilities and, if it believes that a state is using them to build a nuclear weapon, then it must report this to the united nations security council.
Non-Argumentative	 the usual objection to iaea effectiveness is its inability to access states that haven’t signed the npt.
Non-Argumentative	 the us has recently become frustrated with iaea efforts and has started to work outside the framework of the ntp.
Non-Argumentative	 in particular, president bush had proposed that enrichment and reprocessing facilities should be denied to states that do already possess them.
Non-Argumentative	 he has also started the proliferation security initiative, an informal arrangement between the us and its allies to share intelligence and intercept suspect cargoes at sea.
Non-Argumentative	 note that the us essentially views these actions as a supplement, rather than an alternative, to the npt and iaea.
Non-Argumentative	 nobody would deny that the iaea has had some successes, and few in the us are keen to abandon the npt entirely; rather this debate is about whether it is effective for the us to take additional action to prevent nuclear proliferation.
Argumentative	 a very current issue is the question of iran and the chances of it acquiring nuclear weapons, where iaea sanctions and warnings have been ignored by iran or considered ineffective by some countries, like the usa.
Argumentative	states can legally acquire the capacity to build a nuclear bomb and then withdraw from the treaty .
Argumentative	 the essential problem is that uranium and plutonium are used as fuel for both nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs .
Argumentative	 the processes by which these materials are manufactured , uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing , are permitted because they have legitimate applications in civilian nuclear programs .
Argumentative	 on its website it is stated : `` the iaea verifies through its inspection system that states comply with their commitments , under the non-proliferation treaty and other non-proliferation agreements , to use nuclear material and facilities only for peaceful purposes . ''
Argumentative	 providing a state ` plays along ' with the iaea and allows inspections , it can legally acquire these technologies .
Argumentative	 then , once it is in a position to produce material suitable for use in a weapon , it can simply leave the npt .
Argumentative	 all a state then has to do to leave the npt is givemonths ' notice ; the iaea is then left powerless .
Argumentative	 indeed , this is precisely what north korea did , and what it is feared that iran will do .
Argumentative	 north korea is known to have reprocessing technology , and it probably has an enrichment capability too .
Argumentative	 init withdrew from the npt , following the breakdown of an agreement with the us , placing its facilities out of the reach of the iaea .
Argumentative	 although international law has succeeded in preventing proliferation in some cases , its ` optional ' nature means that to be truly effective it must sometimes be bolstered by american unilateral action .
Argumentative	 the iaea 's approach to non-proliferation , monitoring nuclear facilities , focuses , almost entirely , on what is known as the demand side .
Argumentative	 america can supplement this with a counter-proliferation strategy that focuses on preventing supply .
Argumentative	 a us-led coalition has , for example , started the proliferation security initiative , psi .
Argumentative	 states within the psi have agreed to share intelligence about unlawful shipments of nuclear materials and then intercept these cargoes at sea .
Argumentative	 this strategy enables the us to prevent proliferation to organizations which are outside of the iaea 's reach , namely terrorist organizations and states which are not party to , or ignore , the npt .
Argumentative	 although exact details are kept secret , a number of illegal shipments have been stopped and seized under psi .
Argumentative	 a second example of america 's supply-side approach is the proposal to stop the spread of reprocessing and enrichment .
Argumentative	 clearly , preventing potential proliferators from buying the technology to produce nuclear weapons in the first place is a more effective strategy than monitoring it once it is in the hands of states which may abuse it .
Argumentative	 unlike the iaea , the usa is able to take fast , decisive action against a potential proliferator .
Argumentative	 in contrast , the united states can act quickly and decisively .
Argumentative	 quickly because there is usually consensus between the president and congress about proliferation issues .
Argumentative	 decisively because of the massive diplomatic , economic and , in extreme cases , military power at the usa 's disposal .
Argumentative	 this power can not only be used to stop a potential proliferator in its tracks but is also an effective deterrent to states trying to go nuclear .
Argumentative	 in an example , the us was able to take decisive action in kosovo when the rest of the world was dealing with bureaucracy , instead of helping the people there .
