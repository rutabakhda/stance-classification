Non-Argumentative	climate change and global warming are the result of massive emissions of ‘greenhouse gases’ such as co2, cfcs and nitrous oxide.
Non-Argumentative	 this has been a problem due to the exponential increase in the burning of fossil fuels throughout the industrial revolution which began in the 19th century.
Non-Argumentative	 climate change is a phenomenon which will have a global impact, although of course nations will be affected to different degrees.
Non-Argumentative	 although the problem is a global one, developed nations who are heavily industrialised usually release more greenhouse gases per capita than developing ones.
Non-Argumentative	 in attempting to address and solve global warming, many have asked whether developed nations - which led the industrial revolution and are responsible for most of the greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere - should bear a greater responsibility for combating climate change.
Non-Argumentative	this has been stimulated in large part by the kyoto protocol signed in 1992, which exempted developing nations such as china and india, from the same emissions-reductions obligations as developed countries.
Non-Argumentative	 the principle underlying kyoto is known as "common but differentiated responsibilities", which continues as a centerpiece principle for those calling on developed countries to assume a greater responsibility.
Non-Argumentative	 china, india, and other developing countries call for recognition of this principle, while many developed countries argue that conditions have changed as developing countries have begun to industrialize and pollute more rapidly in recent years.
Non-Argumentative	 there are many questions involved in this public debate.
Non-Argumentative	 the question of who should bear the burden of cutting emissions in order to prevent climate change has been a central reason for there being no new major binding agreement along similar lines to the original kyoto treaty.
Non-Argumentative	 the united nations climate change conferences at copenhagen and cancun did not live up to their billing and did not result in a renewal of kyoto or the creation of a replacement with agreements being in more minor areas such as creating a ‘green climate fund’ at cancun.
Non-Argumentative	 the most recent united nations climate change conference in durban was slightly more successful with agreement that kyoto would continue until a new agreement is finalized although not all original parties to the agreement are willing to sign up, canada for example has left the treaty.
Non-Argumentative	 more importantly there was agreement on the ‘durban platform’ from developing countries like china and india that they will be a part of a legally binding treaty to be negotiated by 2015.
Non-Argumentative	 this therefore opens the door to developing countries taking more responsibility to combat climate change.
Argumentative	 it is the developed world that has the capability to combat climate change .
Argumentative	 it is they that have most to cut per capita .
Argumentative	 more importantly it is these developed countries that have the research capabilities to come up with the necessary technology to make the economy greener , to produce renewable energy , to mitigate against the effects of disasters .
Argumentative	 moreover these same places are the countries that have the finance available to fund these activities ; not only funding the research into the solutions but also the financial resources to put them into action all around the world .
Argumentative	 poor countries turn to the powerful financial centres such as london and new york to finance large projects , the same will be the case with projects to mitigate climate change .
Argumentative	 finally these countries have the expertise to put these new inventions and projects into practice ; they have the experts to work out the best places to build , to advise on building , and make sure the project does not have unintended side effects .
Argumentative	 as the nations with the greatest capability , developed nations have an increased responsibility to act .
Argumentative	 the most developed nations are also the most powerful in the international community ; they have a duty to lead by example .
Argumentative	 even if india and china are rapidly rising the developed countries between them are still the most powerful economies .
Argumentative	 if developing nations perceive that more developed ones are not acting to combat climate change , they will have no imperative to act .
Argumentative	 this is because some developing countries such as china or india want to maximize their development capacity in order to compete with developed countries .
Argumentative	 they are only likely to cut carbon emissions if those developed nations they compete with do so first -- that way their attempt to compete is not jeopardised .
Argumentative	 the climate change talks that have achieved relatively little have shown this to be the case -- china has only shown willing to do a deal if the united states commits itself first .
Argumentative	 it is through heavy industrialisation that developed countries are developed -- since they contributed more to climate change , they have a greater obligation to resolve it .
Argumentative	 climate change has largely been caused by long-term emissions by developed countries .
Argumentative	 while china is now the world 's biggest co2 emitter and other developing countries emissions are rapidly rising historically the vast majority of emissions have been from developed nations .
Argumentative	 fromtothe united states produced 314,772 million metric tonnes of co2 compared to china 's 89,243 million metric tonnes and while india now produces more co2 germany over the same period emitted three times as much .
Argumentative	 as co2 can remain in the atmosphere for a long time , about% will be removed withinyears , but% or more may remain for thousands of years , the history of emissions is as relevant as current emissions .
Argumentative	 since they contribute more of the damage , and since each nation has a responsibility for the harm it has caused , developed nations have an increased obligation to combat climate change .
Argumentative	 developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita , inthe us emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to china 's 5.3 tons per person , and therefore a reduction from these nations is both easier and has a greater impact than from developing nations .
Argumentative	 countries with high co2 emissions can reduce these emissions through lifestyle changes that do not reduce citizens quality of life , for example simply by reducing the amount they drive -- walking or going by bike when only going a short distance -- whereas for developing nations reductions either have to work out ways of doing things more efficiently or accept that living standards will be affected as most people 's lifestyles are already low carbon , the challenge is to keep it that way while improving quality of life .
Argumentative	 developing nations need to be allowed to develop without the burden of emission restrictions .
Argumentative	 developed nations have been allowed to industrialize at whatever pace they wished , and through industrialization produce emissions .
Argumentative	 despite having been polluting the atmosphere as a result of industrialization since the early 19th century developed nations only began comprehensively limiting pollution after world war ii in order to reduce smog through regulation such as theair pollution control act andclean air act in the united states and many developed countries have yet to regulate their co2 emissions .
Argumentative	 having had free reign to develop foryears the developed nations need to take responsibility for thoseyears of irresponsibility while giving the developing world longer to clean up its act .
Argumentative	 the developing world at the same time has higher responsibilities that come first , for example to ensure that there is no one living in poverty .
Argumentative	 in indiamillion people live on under $ 1.25 per day , it is absurd to suggest that india despite having higher co2 emissions than japan , indeed almost double , should have to reduce its emissions by a similar amount and at the same time industrialise to pull these millions out of poverty .
