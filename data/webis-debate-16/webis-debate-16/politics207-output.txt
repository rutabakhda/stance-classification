Non-Argumentative	the comprehensive test ban treaty (ctbt) outlaws the testing of nuclear weapons (united nations, 1996).
Non-Argumentative	 so far,countries signed the treaty, but it cannot become a binding international law until it has been ratified by all states capable of developing nuclear weapons, of which there arespecified in the treaty.
Non-Argumentative	 of these states, three (india, pakistan and north korea) have not signed the treaty, and a further six (china, egypt, israel, iran, and the united states) are yet to ratify it (preparatory commission, 2010).
Non-Argumentative	 the united states signed the treaty in 1996, as soon as the language was agreed upon, but the senate rejected it by a tiny margin.
Non-Argumentative	 while the idea of the ctbt is quite simple, implementation is immensely complex.
Non-Argumentative	 one of the greatest concerns of the treaty, and of the international community, is with monitoring countries so as to verify their compliance with the ban.
Non-Argumentative	 to this end the treaty sets up the international monitoring system (ims), a network of hundreds of scientific facilities spread across the globe which monitor seismic activity, radioactive fallout, atmospheric noise and oceanic waves to pick up evidence of a nuclear explosion.
Non-Argumentative	 if the ims detects a suspected nuclear test then an on-site inspection can follow.
Non-Argumentative	 the treaty does not detail the action that would be taken against a state that has broken the treaty, but the charter of the united nations does empower the security council to take "appropriate steps".
Non-Argumentative	 although the treaty has not yet come into force, most of the ims is now in place and working.
Argumentative	 debates about the ctbt revolve around the efficacy of the treaty to prevent nuclear testing, and whether it is in the interest of nuclear-capable, and would-be nuclear-capable, states to agree to it.
Argumentative	nuclear weapons tests release vast quantities of radiation into the atmosphere , contaminating water supplies , soil , and harming human , plant , and animal health irreparably .
Argumentative	 the bomb tests conducted by the united states betweenand, for example , releasedtimes the radioactivity of the chernobyl disaster1 .
Argumentative	 radioactivity released by russian tests in the 1950s and 1960s are estimated to have released even greater amounts of radiation .
Argumentative	 it is estimated that 2.4 million people currently living will die due to cancers caused by radioactivity generated by nuclear testing .
Argumentative	 the genetic damage created by nuclear tests has killed , and will kill many innocent people .
Argumentative	 accidents can also occur , as in the united states when an accident insaw inhabitants of towns near a test site blanketed in the radioactive plume .
Argumentative	 such horrors can not be allowed to continue , but would be all the more likely in poorer countries trying to test weapons .
Argumentative	 furthermore , nuclear testing has done untold damage to the environment and ecosystems around the world .
Argumentative	 in the pacific , for example , hydrogen bomb testing destroyed whole ecologies .
Argumentative	 even when tested underground nuclear weapons are dangerous to the environment , with radiation seeping out of test sites at half of all such tests2 .
Argumentative	 it is imperative that the environmentally devastating effects of these weapons not be allowed to continue through testing .
