Non-Argumentative	on the 30th june 2012, egypt welcomed its first democratically elected government and first elected president; mohamed morsi.
Non-Argumentative	 their election was the result of months of protest against the previous president hosni mubarak, who had ruled over the country for the past thirty years.
Non-Argumentative	 there was a great sense of optimism in both the domestic and international community for the first democratically elected president and parliament.
Non-Argumentative	 it was expected that they would reverse the economic and democratic injustice which egypt had suffered in recent years.
Non-Argumentative	 this was not to be the case, however.
Non-Argumentative	 several policies and actions taken by morsi were poorly received by many in egypt.
Non-Argumentative	 when mohamed morsi announced in novemberthat he was enacting a declaration which made him immune from judicial interference.
Non-Argumentative	 this was perceived by many to be a return to dictatorship, which led to widespread protests.
Non-Argumentative	 both anti and pro morsi supporters took to the street and the egyptian army gave the presidenthours to resolve the crisis.
Non-Argumentative	 when morsi failed to do so, he was ousted from power on the 3rd july 2013.
Non-Argumentative	 an interim government was put in place with the support of the army.
Non-Argumentative	this action received a mixed response, some welcomed it stating that morsi was undermining democratic institutions.
Non-Argumentative	 others were less enthusiastic, however, pointing to morsi’s elected position and the authoritarian way in which the army acted.
Argumentative	  separation of powers is a key democratic principle which morsi undermined with the novemberdeclaration .
Argumentative	 the underlying idea of the separation of powers is that one branch of government should not have undue power over any other .
Argumentative	 that is why there are a number of checks and balances set out which allows each branch to constrain the actions of the others to prevent them acting illegally .
Argumentative	 morsi 's declaration that he would remove the checks and balances which the judiciary held over the presidency violated this principle .
Argumentative	 this led many to fear that morsi was returning the country to a dictatorship where he could force through the muslim brotherhood 's agenda , undoing the work of the arab spring .
Argumentative	 the army 's intercession was welcomed by many as maintaining democracy .
Argumentative	 the official line of argument for the egyptian army 's intervention was that morsi 's administration was failing to grasp control of a worsening situation .
Argumentative	 the response to morsi 's judicial immunity had been largely negative , with tens of thousands taking to the streets to protest .
Argumentative	 soon after , pro-morsi protestors began their own protests .
Argumentative	 muslim brotherhood supporters were called to defend the palace and the resulting clashes left ten dead .
Argumentative	 on the 1st julymillions of protestors gathered in tahrir square , as well as in alexandria , port said and suez and the egyptian army stated it would intervene if the government did not ` meet the demands of the people ' by restructuring the government to appease protestors .
Argumentative	 the protestors did not disperse , and there were several ministers who resigned from government .
Argumentative	 with no clear policy change in sight , morsi had evidently failed to take control of the situation .
Argumentative	 general el-sisi , leader of the coup , claimed that they ` could not stay silent and blind to the call of the egyptian masses ' .
Argumentative	 the intervention was necessary as egypt had become ungovernable .
Argumentative	 morsi 's inability to tackle the main issues which faced egypt was another issue which caused the large-scale protests leading to his removal .
Argumentative	 one of the major reasons for egypt 's lotus revolution was the lack of economic reform .
Argumentative	 rising living costs , unemployment and wage levels were causes of grievance for the majority of egyptians .
Argumentative	 the egyptian population hoped that , once the corruption of the mubarak regime was replaced by a democratic system , their economic condition would improve .
Argumentative	 this was not to be the case .
Argumentative	 the morsi government planned to reduce its fuel subsidies to entitle the country to a $ 4.8 billion loan from the international monetary fund , raising the living costs of the average citizens .
Argumentative	 in conjunction with the subsidy cuts , the government failed to tackle unemployment .
Argumentative	 at the time of morsi 's ouster from government there were 3.6 million unemployed , an increase of one million since.
Argumentative	 analysts linked the lack of jobs to the security of the state claiming that unemployment would lead to greater numbers of rioters and furthering instability .
Argumentative	 in a poll assessing the egyptians ' attitude toward their government and their future ,% felt they were worse off than five years ago .
Argumentative	 this dissatisfaction then led to dissent .
Argumentative	 another major concern of the anti-morsi protestors on whose behalf the egyptian army intervened was the islamist nature of morsi .
Argumentative	 while many supported the islamic nature of the muslim brotherhood , there were equally many liberals and coptic christians who were afraid of egypt transforming in to an islamic state .
Argumentative	 mubarak had managed to secure popularity within these groups by exploiting this fear that , should his regime be overthrown , extreme islamists such as the muslim brotherhood would take control and deprive them of their rights .
Argumentative	 the morsi government 's constitution was thus perceived as a threat to minority and secular rights , and thus a security issue .
Argumentative	 even if this was not the case , morsi should have done more to calm the population 's fear rather than allowing discord to materialise .
