Non-Argumentative	we all want and should eat better.
Non-Argumentative	 and each of us has different definitions and priorities when it comes to “good food”.
Non-Argumentative	for some good equals healthy, low in fat and sugar.
Non-Argumentative	 not at all a bad idea in a world with more thanbillion overweight andmillion obese individuals where energy-dense, fat and sugar laden food takes most of the blame.
Non-Argumentative	for others the goal is to eat sustainably and for many that means eating food that was produced locally.
Non-Argumentative	 kaiser permamente discovered that it can reduce its carbon footprint by more thanpercent by using local produce in their menus.
Non-Argumentative	this could also mean eating food that is ‘fair trade’ that makes sure that a decent amount of the money spent by the consumer goes to the farmer who produces the food.
Non-Argumentative	lastly, and perhaps most controversially, some will refuse to eat genetically modified food, for fears they’re both unhealthy and unsustainable.
Non-Argumentative	underlying all those very diverse goals is labeling – specifically labeling food products with their fat and sugar content, origin, way of production and possibly gmo content.
Non-Argumentative	 but is this really a way to give the consumer the information she needs to reach her goals of health, sustainability and advocacy or will labeling foods fall short of its promise, leaving tax payers and companies to pay for the failed experiment?
Non-Argumentative	because this is such a broad topic, we’ll be looking at the combined issues of different labeling schemes, focusing on the gda-system and the traffic light system, which have been introduced in the uk and elsewhere in the eu and labeling foods containing gmos, allowed on a voluntary basis in the us.
Non-Argumentative	 thus the government in today’s debate stands for all sorts of food labeling: all contents, gda and traffic lights, origin and gmo content.
Argumentative	 it is a basic right for us as consumers to know what it is we eat .
Argumentative	 today more and more foods that we buy are processed , they include many harmful additives , causing conditions such as hyperactivity in children , or are advertised as health food , but are in reality loaded with sugar or salt .
Argumentative	 it is therefore necessary for consumers to be made aware of all their food contains in order to make safe and healthy choices for themselves and their families .
Argumentative	 given that there is a global trend of increasing numbers of overweight and obese people , food that is fattening and therefore contributes to this problem needs to be clearly labeled so people can avoid them .
Argumentative	 research shows that having this nutritional information helps people make better choices .
Argumentative	 up to% of consumers reconsider buying a food item after reading the food label and finding out what 's inside .
Argumentative	 another study points out that there were `` significant differences in mean nutrient intake of total calories , total fat , saturated fat , cholesterol , sodium , dietary fiber , and sugars '' when people could go ahead and use the information about the food they were considering buying .
Argumentative	 it is therefore clear that making more information about food available , especially in the form of readily available food labels , helps people make choices that will help the fight against obesity .
Argumentative	 innovation is inevitable .
Argumentative	 that holds true for food industry as much as any other industry -- and the food companies want to share their progress with the consumer to benefit from it .
Argumentative	 with the impact food labeling has on consumer choices , companies turned the issue on its head , producing food that is more in tune with what the people want and using labels to tell us about it .
Argumentative	 an example is pepsico 's `` smart spot '' program that is intended to help consumers identify healthier products -- products the company developed as a consequence of consumer pressure for healthier drinks that contain less sugar .
Argumentative	 what is more , the strategy proved very profitable for the company , with the smart spot products sales increasingpercent or three times as fast as the rest of the business .
Argumentative	 we see that companies were able to adapt to the pressure labeling created with excellent products , in tune with consumer values , and make a profit as well .
