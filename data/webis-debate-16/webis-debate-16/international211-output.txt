Non-Argumentative	the security council is the key organ of the united nations with primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.
Non-Argumentative	 it has the power to establish peacekeeping missions, impose international sanctions, and can authorise military action against a sovereign state.
Non-Argumentative	 currently it consist of fifteen members, five of them (uk, usa, france, russia and china) are permanent members that hold a special veto power over all non-procedural decisions in the council.
Non-Argumentative	 the other ten are elected for two-year terms.
Non-Argumentative	 directly after world warthe security council had eleven members; after the amendment of the un charter inthe number of non-permanent members was increased from six to ten but no other substantial changes were made.
Non-Argumentative	 since the first reform in the sixties no other reforms have been made, although the world today has changed drastically from the world just after second world war.
Non-Argumentative	the question of equitable representation in the security council has been on the general assembly agenda since 1979, when a number of mostly developing countries raised the issue of under-representation of developing and non-aligned countries in the security council.
Non-Argumentative	 although the topic of the reform of the security council was opened already in the late seventies there was no extensive debate until the 1990s.
Non-Argumentative	 the 1980s were still an era marked by antagonism between east and west and due to the large economic problems of developing countries their influence and that of the non-aligned movement decreased.
Non-Argumentative	 at that time there was no general support for major reform, since all the permanent members, except for china, opposed any expansion vigorously.
Non-Argumentative	while the 1980s were perhaps still an inconvenient time for the discussion, the atmosphere dramatically changed in the nineties.
Non-Argumentative	 the security council has become much more active after the end of the cold war and has therefore attracted more attention and consequently also criticism.
Non-Argumentative	 today it seems to be universally acknowledged that some sort of reform is needed and urgent but there is no consensus on what this reform should look like.
Non-Argumentative	 there are several models debated, some of them propose expansion only in the non-permanent category, others a third category of members that would have longer terms but no veto power.
Non-Argumentative	 the most supported models envisage increases in both the permanent and non-permanent categories.
Non-Argumentative	 one of them is the so-called razali proposal that addspermanent (germany, japan, one from africa, one from asia, one from latin america) andnon-permanent seats (one for asia, latin america, africa and eastern europe) to the existing council, increasing the total number of members to 24.
Non-Argumentative	 this proposal enjoys the widest support, yet it has not gained the sufficient number of votes required by the un charter (two-thirds of un members, including all five permanent members are needed for any charter amendments).
Non-Argumentative	 the arguments below discuss the pros and cons of a plan to expand membership in both permanent and non-permanent categories.
Non-Argumentative	furthermore due to the increased activity of the eu in foreign policy areas, the question has arisen, triggering new debates, whether the eu should get a permanent seat on the unsc, replacing france and the uk who would lose their permanent seats.
Argumentative	 the possible changes in the un security council and the eventual consequences of them are object of the current debate.
Argumentative	the current security council does n't reflect the economic reality of the 21st century .
Argumentative	 france and great britain have clearly lost their position among the most powerful nations and their role was long ago taken over by germany and japan .
Argumentative	 they are the 3rd and 4th world economies .
Argumentative	 furthermore these two countries are the second and third largest contributors to the un budget and deserve a permanent seat in the council .
Argumentative	 moreover , as permanent members pay an extra share for their seat , japan and germany 's contributions would bring considerable amounts to the un budget -- `` the three largest contributors to the united nations , the us , 22.000 % of the un budget , japan , 12.530 % , and germany , 8.018 % , thus together finance some% of the entire un budget . ''
Argumentative	  meanwhile brazil and india have emerged as major economies and stable democracies over the past decade , and deserve recognition for their global importance .
Argumentative	 at the moment many countries are not heard in the council and some states may never gain a chance of being elected to the security council .
Argumentative	 this leaves billions of the world 's population without representation in the world 's highest body .
Argumentative	 how can india with over a sixth of the world 's population be left out ?
Argumentative	 security council expansion would make the un much more democratic as there would be more participants representing more of the people of the world present in closed meetings and informal consultations .
Argumentative	 expansion would increase the transparency and therefore the accountability of the council -- something that even countries sometimes considered to be against democracy believe is necessary `` he , seyed mohammad ali mottaghi nejad , said iran believed that the links between the issues comprised the `` basic objective '' of a comprehensive reform towards a council that was more democratic , inclusive , equitably representative , transparent , effective and accountable .
Argumentative	 ``  inthere were onlyun members , so eleven council members were adequately representing all voices .
Argumentative	 today the un membership has risen to almost four times the number of the original one , yet there are only fifteen voices in the council .
Argumentative	 this means that there are many countries who do not have anyone on the security council that has similar priorities to them , their views may well be unrepresented .
Argumentative	 there is a growing imbalance between developing and developed countries representation in the council .
Argumentative	 four out of five permanent members are industrialized and four out of five are `` european '' .
Argumentative	 the four-fifths of humankind that live in developing countries have only one spokesman among the permanent five .
Argumentative	 giving africa , asia and latin america a permanent seat is a step forward in north-south balance -- `` currently , four out of five veto-bearing members are industrialized countries and the fifth , china , is rapidly approaching industrialized status .
Argumentative	 many in the rest of the world seethe at their exclusion from this elite group .
Argumentative	 africa , latin america , and the islamic world , for example , have no permanent voice on the council .
Argumentative	 without a voice , it is understandable why many countries are unwilling to send troops or aid whenever the security council demands it .
Argumentative	 this imbalance , highlighted by the iraq war , has made security council reform a hot topic of debate . ''
Argumentative	  the eu is one of the world 's largest trade blocs , has the world 's largest gdp , and represents almost half a billion people .
Argumentative	 a permanent seat for the eu would reflect those new power dimensions .
Argumentative	 the permanent seats for france and the uk are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of world war ii .
Argumentative	 however , the global balance of powers has shifted significantly since then : france and the uk have declined and at the same time , the eu has emerged as a major player in the international arena .
