Non-Argumentative	clinical trials1,2 have four phases, which proceed sequentially.
Non-Argumentative	 not all drugs make it to the end of the process (if a drug ‘fails’ a phasetrial, there is little point in running it through phase 2!)
Non-Argumentative	.
Non-Argumentative	preclinical trials: these happen in a lab, and whilst they almost invariably involve testing on animals, do not involve human testing.
Non-Argumentative	 the purpose of these trials is to establish whether the drug is safe and effective.
Non-Argumentative	phasetrials:the purpose of phasetrials is to discover possible side-effects, establish efficacy in humans and calculate what dosage is needed.
Non-Argumentative	these trials are the first to involve humans, and so involve a degree of risk.
Non-Argumentative	 to minimise this, researchers test on small groups (normally giving progressively greater doses to successive groups) using small doses.
Non-Argumentative	 sometimes healthy volunteers are used in these trials, and other times people who are very ill are recruited (e.g. the trial of a new cancer drug).
Non-Argumentative	 whether healthy or unwell volunteers are used depends on factors like whether the treatment involves a level of risk unacceptable to the healthy (e.g. a new form of chemotherapy would normally be trialled in an advanced cancer patient, because the level of risk and severity of expected side-effects are not acceptable to those who have nothing to gain.
Non-Argumentative	 further relevant factors include whether or not the treatment is feasible in a healthy volunteer.
Non-Argumentative	phasetrials:phasetrials test the treatment on larger groups of people with the relevant illness.
Non-Argumentative	 the purpose is to find out more about the efficacy of the drug (including which specific thing it treats best, e.g. a new form of chemotherapy might work better on some forms of cancer than others) and more about side-effects.
Non-Argumentative	these trials are tested against a placebo (e.g. an identical pill that doesn’t contain any medication).
Non-Argumentative	 that is, those recruited into the trial will be split into two groups, one of which receives the medicine, the other of which receives a placebo.
Non-Argumentative	 these are normally conducted under ‘double blind’ conditions: whilst everyone involved knows that there is the possibility of receiving a placebo, neither the patient nor the doctor giving the pill knows who is receiving what (obviously who gets what is nevertheless recorded).
Non-Argumentative	 the purpose of this is to find out whether the effect the treatment has is due to the drug, or whether it’s just due to the expectation of getting better (placebo effect).
Non-Argumentative	phasetrials:the purpose of phasetrials is to determine whether or not the new drug/treatment is better than the best currently available treatment.
Non-Argumentative	because this is a difficult thing to test, and may involve the measurement of small differences between treatments, a large sample size is needed (many people must be tested on).
Non-Argumentative	 for example, if we were testing a new drug for cancer (let’s call it newafex) we would get a big group of people, give half of them newafex, and the other half would receive the best current treatement (whatever drug they would have had if newafex didn’t exist; let’s call it oldafex).
Non-Argumentative	 then we look at remission rates (the percentage of people who get a bit better) and compare.
Non-Argumentative	a new drug is unlikely to get a license if it is not more effective than other drugs, although there are exceptions (if, for example, the side-effects are less severe, or variety is needed).
Non-Argumentative	phasetrials:these occur after a drug has been granted a licence (and is allowed to be prescribed by doctors).
Non-Argumentative	 their purpose is to determine the long term risks and benefits of the treatment, and monitor its performance when used more widely.
Non-Argumentative	 these go on for many years (and severe long term side-effects are rare), and it would consequently be impractical to perform this sort of long term testing before licensinggetting on to a clinical trial: patients who may benefit from a treatment that is being trialled can be referred to that trial by their doctors; the company trialling the drug will have criteria that that patient must meet in order to qualify for the trail and it is ultimately at their discretion, not the doctor’s, whether someone is accepted.
Non-Argumentative	healthy volunteers participating in phasetrials tend to be recruited through adverts, and are normally paid well for their participation.
Argumentative	some countries do already allow the provision of unapproved drugs that are still going through trials on compassionate grounds through programs such as expanded access to investigational drugs for treatment use (united states), special access program (canada), and temporary authorisation for use (france).3we live in a free society , and accept that people have the right to do as they please ; including exposing themselves to risk , as long as in so doing they do not harm others , mill 's harm principle .1 to deny people the right to choose to take drugs that are still undergoing testing that , whilst they are risky , may save their lives , is a violation of this principle : in choosing to expose themselves to that risk , no-one else is harmed and indeed in the long run others may be saved as a result of the tests .
Argumentative	 further , with the assistance of medical professionals and other support , the decision to take this risk can easily be well-informed and consensual .
Argumentative	 at a point when all ordinary medical avenues have been expended , and the outcome appears bleak , new treatments still undergoing trials can be seen as the last hope .
Argumentative	 people are often aware of the existence of currently experimental drugs , they are likely to research into possible cures , and indeed there may have been attempts by their doctor to get the patient onto the trial .
Argumentative	 however , not everyone who could benefit from treatment is accepted onto a clinical trial : some trials , at some stages , restrict their recruitment to , for example , patients with no complicating factors or other illnesses .
Argumentative	 it is unethical and cruel to make people live out their last days knowing that there was something that could have helped , but to which access was restricted through no fault of their own : thus , you should allow anyone with a terminal illness access to such treatments .
Argumentative	 under the status quo , someone with a terminal illness is offered two choices : death , or to join a trial , where such trials exist .
Argumentative	 however , when they join a trial they face the possibility that they will be given a placebo , not the drug .
Argumentative	 whilst this is probably in the best interest of future patients , a good clinical trial will determine the efficacy of the new treatment , it rides roughshod over the rights of the current patients , not to be sacrificed for future generations , and the duty of physicians to act in the best interests of their present patients .
Argumentative	 there are two consequences here : the first is that it is morally dubious to use the present patients as mere means to an end , rather than acting in their own best interests , especially where , if randomized to the placebo arm the outcome of death is a certainty .
Argumentative	 the second consequence is a practical one : compliance with the trial is lessened at the point at which patients can take alternative measures to increase their chance of survival .
Argumentative	 this was best documented during the early stages of the aids crisis in the 1980s , where there was evidence of ` cheating ' during the trials1 .
Argumentative	 people lied or bribed their way into clinical studies ; and shared drugs to dilute the ` risk ' of being on placebo .
Argumentative	 this has the obvious impact of casting doubt on the scientific results of the trials : you can no longer be sure who has taken what , and what other conditions they may have .
Argumentative	 testing new drugs is a very expensive process , inthe average cost was estimated at aroundmillion for the large scale phase iii tests1 however this is contested and it could be much higher it represents% of pharmaceutical companies r&d expenditures , which since a recent estimated the development cost of a drug can be up to $ 5.8 billion , due to including failures , the cost of trials would in some cases then be $ 2billion ,2 which is currently funded by pharmaceutical companies .
Argumentative	 they fund these tests because it is either impossible , very difficult or very risky to access large markets before testing has been completed , e.g. in the usa companies are only allowed to sell new drugs `` off-study '' , i.e. during trials , at cost3 , if you allow all terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs , you reduce the incentive for companies to continue testing their products : they will have access to a large market prior to the completion of testing , and will therefore have no incentive to complete trials , which are expensive and risk finding the product ineffective .
