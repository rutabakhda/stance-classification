Non-Argumentative	conscription refers to the compulsory enrolment of citizens to national service.
Non-Argumentative	 national service does not always include military service but traditionally revolves around the prospect or existence of a state of war.
Non-Argumentative	 the object of conscription is to permit the mass recruitment of young men and women, in times of need, to come to the aid of the state.
Non-Argumentative	 of the contemporary examples of conscription being used, the vietnam is perhaps most infamous for its popular images of american conscientious objectors burning their draft cards in objection to the war's justifications.
Non-Argumentative	 conscription was subsequently abolished in the united states in 1973, but it remains in many states, such as finland and austria in the developed world and mexico and thailand in the developing world, as a bulwark against potential aggression.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents also argue that conscription benefits the citizens enlisted, encouraging their patriotism and teaching them invaluable life skills.
Argumentative	 opponents respond that the lives of one's citizens cannot be used as property to use in times of war and that regardless, there are economic disincentives to conscription.
Argumentative	national service helps to promote patriotism and a sense of nationhood .
Argumentative	 in many countries national pride is at an all-time low in the wake of recent the financial crash and resulting austerity budgets and this gives us the chance to rally around a shared cause , no matter what race or culture you come from .
Argumentative	 the individual has a duty to put something back into society and national service allows this .
Argumentative	 whether it be through protecting the country or helping with social or environmental projects , this encourages the idea of working as a community instead of merely for selfish ends .
Argumentative	 even when not in active service , the mere knowledge that one is trained and , at a moment 's notice , deployable to the front line in the protection of one 's society and way of life promotes a wonderful togetherness .
Argumentative	 an example of this is the irish in world war i. although they were only recruited as volunteers even nationalists signed up .
Argumentative	 a nationalist mp john redmond described it as ' a distinctively irish army , composed of irishmen , led by irishmen and trained at home in ireland ' ` the achievements of that irish army have covered ireland with glory before the world ' , this was in stark contrast to the disillusionment and risings nationalists back in ireland were participating in .
Argumentative	  a volunteer army , often separated from society at large and operating as a ` state within a state ' , does not serve such purposes so easily .
Argumentative	 in the military , young men acquire many skills for everyday life .
Argumentative	 these include personality traits like self-discipline , teamwork and leadership and practical skills like first aid , driving an ambulance , extra practice for surgeons , swimming , etc. that might be beneficial either to their own careers or , in cases of emergency , to everyone as these skills are transferable .
Argumentative	 as william james once wrote about national service , ` our gilded youths would be drafted off to get the childishness knocked out of them , and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas ' .
Argumentative	  furthermore it acts as a test of manhood .
Argumentative	 as ann marlowe points out , ` if we showed all of our young people a closer look at danger , if we forced them into some form of self-testing , perhaps we would not only give them a sense of greater purpose , but also strip the false glamour from depictions of cruelty and destructruction .
Argumentative	  we accept the need for national service in wartime and this is just an extension of this .
Argumentative	 conscription during peacetime would mean that the country was prepared for emergencies when they happened , rather than having to prepare after the fact .
Argumentative	 as us congressman charles rangel has argued , the fairest way of ensuring that all share in the sacrifice is a military draft , poutvaara & wagener  p..
Argumentative	  it would ensure that at the time of a military conflict the state has enough trained troops , therefore the security of that state is enhanced - a benefit every citizen can enjoy .
Argumentative	 the philosopher john rawls believed similarly , arguing ` conscription is permissible only if it is demanded for the defence of liberty itself ' , carter  p..
Argumentative	  furthermore , it also acts as a potential deterrent against aggressive action , for the existence of a large pool of well-trained reserves is in principle little different to the existence of a large , well-trained standing army .
Argumentative	 the cause of peace is well-served by a policy of conscription .
Argumentative	  carter , a.  .
Argumentative	 liberalism and the obligation to military service .
Argumentative	 political studies , 68-81 .
Argumentative	 conscription permits the state to raise , both cheaply and quickly , a large , able-bodied force ready for combat .
Argumentative	 states with conscription-based armed services are able to prepare for combat without the expense of housing a large volunteer force .
Argumentative	 furthermore , in the context of surprise attacks , conscription permits the instantaneous raising of a large , competent army .
Argumentative	 a volunteer force faced with a sudden and extreme threat would not be able to raise , equip and prepare a sufficiently-powerful force within a similar time .
Argumentative	 in, when faced with the threat of an arab alliance led by general nasser , israel was reliant on the swift mobilization of its conscripts in order to first deter and then repel the arab forces .
Argumentative	 a volunteer force would likely have been slower to respond , less able to deter and incapable of repelling .
Argumentative	 without conscription , a state leaves itself at the mercy of an enemy able to conceal its intentions and strike rapidly .
