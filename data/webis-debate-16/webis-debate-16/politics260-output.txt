Non-Argumentative	the alternative vote (av) electoral system is currently used to elect representatives to australia's house of representatives.
Non-Argumentative	 it is sometimes called the instant run-off system (in america) or preferential voting (in australia).
Non-Argumentative	 many of those who are dissatisfied with the first past the post (fptp) electoral system used in the uk and usa argue for a change to av.
Non-Argumentative	 the uk labour party advocated av in their manifesto for thegeneral election, and the conservative-lib dem coalition held a referendum on changing the voting system for the uk house of commons to av on may 5th 2011.
Non-Argumentative	like the fptp system used in the usa and the uk, under av each constituency or electoral district elects one representative to the legislature (parliament, assembly or congress).
Non-Argumentative	 but fptp simply asks people to put a mark against the person they prefer.
Non-Argumentative	 for a candidate to win under fptp, they have to get more votes than any other candidate, meaning one may be declared the winner with less than 50% of the votes.
Non-Argumentative	 the alternative vote system differs by ensuring that the winner of each constituency has to have the support of over half the voters – for this reason it is classed as a majoritarian system.
Non-Argumentative	 av achieves this by asking each voter to rank the candidates in order of preference.
Non-Argumentative	 first preference votes are then counted and if one candidate has over 50% of votes cast, they are automatically declared the winner.
Non-Argumentative	 if no one has over half the votes cast, then the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated, and their votes given to the second-choice candidate on their voters’ ballot papers.
Non-Argumentative	 if after adding these redistributed votes one candidate now has over 50% of the votes, then they are declared the winner; if not, the remaining candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their ballot papers redistributed, and so on.
Argumentative	 eventually one candidate must end up with the support of over half the voters, and so will represent that constituency/district in the legislature.
Argumentative	under fptp , party representatives can focus on the concerns of% or so of citizens on whose vote they rely on for re-election .
Argumentative	 this results in tribal politics .
Argumentative	 av , in forcing mps to gain% of votes , forces them to consider those outside their core voters .
Argumentative	 also , according to the jenkins report , see bibliography , av would be likely to create more marginal seats ; this is good for democracy .
Argumentative	 parties currently place more extreme candidates in safe seats to ensure they get elected .
Argumentative	 decreasing the number of safe seats is another way of ensuring that candidates have to address all members of their population and be accountable to all constituents .
Argumentative	 the political studies association suggests that `` evidence from the uk and elsewhere suggests that mps in marginal seats do focus on servicing their constituency more than those in safe seats . ''
Argumentative	 the current fptp system is undemocratic ; currently a majority government can be created with a minority of the vote , because mps are elected with less than% of the vote , lending their decisions little legitimacy .
Argumentative	 `` according to figures from the electoral reform society ,mps , of, received less thanper cent of the vote '' at thegeneral election1 which means the majority of their constituents did not vote for them .
Argumentative	 av ensures that elected representatives have the support the majority of their candidates because they have to get more than% of the vote .
Argumentative	 this gives a stronger democratic mandate to those who are elected .
Argumentative	 under the fptp electoral system , supporters of minority parties either waste their vote to support their ideals , or decide which of the leading parties they dislike lease and vote accordingly .
Argumentative	 research reported by the british academy indicates that% of people voted for a party other than their most preferred in thegeneral election .1 this leaves voters unhappy at having to vote for the lesser of two evils .
Argumentative	 this also perpetuates the tradition two-party politics in the uk , as it makes it hard for a third party to gain enough votes to break through nationally .
Argumentative	 `` under av there would be no technical reason for voting tactically for your most preferred candidate .
Argumentative	 ``av allows voters to express their preferences honestly , as their first preference vote can be a protest vote for a minority party ; when that is inevitably eliminated , their mainstream vote will still contribute to the result .
Argumentative	 av encourages positive voting .
Argumentative	 this also means that voters feel that all votes matter .
Argumentative	 fptp disenfranchises many who do not vote for the two main parties .
Argumentative	 it is still one person one vote , it is just that some people 's vote may be for different candidates in different rounds if their first preference has been eliminated .
Argumentative	 everyone has a say in the final outcome .
Argumentative	 unlike other proportional representation systems the alternative vote is easy to implement when changing from first past the post .
Argumentative	 this is because av does not represent a very large change in terms of how the voting system would work .
Argumentative	 av keeps the same constituencies so mps and candidates would be competing for the same votes they have always done .
Argumentative	 voters would remain in the same constituency so preventing any confusion that would be involved in a fully proportional system .
Argumentative	 the relative small change and therefore the ease to implement can be shown by the relatively small changes had thegeneral election been fought under av .
Argumentative	 labour would have won ten fewer seats , the conservatives twenty three less and liberal democrats thirty two more .1 nobody disputes the fact that extreme right and left parties should be allowed representation if they can gain the support of a large enough section of the voting public .
Argumentative	 irrespective of their views , parties must all be given an equal chance of representation .
Argumentative	 ` better ' democracy must include extremism .
Argumentative	 however , av makes it much less likely that extremist parties will be elected , as they are unlikely to get the required% support , instead of the 25-30 % they currently need if support for opposing parties is split .
