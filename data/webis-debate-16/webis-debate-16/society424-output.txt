Non-Argumentative	feminism is relatively difficult to define, both because of the breadth of the movement, which includes a wide diversity of views and some vigorous internal debate, and because it is so frequently caricatured by its opponents.
Non-Argumentative	 a fair description might be that it is a movement committed to the pursuit of equality, notably but not exclusively sexual equality.
Non-Argumentative	 it is based on an analysis of inequality rooted in the social transformation of sex (the real, biological differences between men and women) into gender (the various ways in which men and women are perceived as having different abilities and social roles), and the ways in which gender is implicated in unequal power relationships between men and women in many areas of life.
Non-Argumentative	feminism assumes that such treatment is cultural and thus possible to change and not simply "the way the world is and must be".
Non-Argumentative	 feminism looks to a different culture as possible, and values moving towards that culture.
Non-Argumentative	 it consists of activism, individually and in groups, to make personal and social change towards that more desirable culture.
Non-Argumentative	 important topics for feminist theory and politics include: the body, class and work, disability, the family, globalization, human rights, popular culture, race and racism, reproduction, science, the self, sex work, human trafficking, and sexuality.
Non-Argumentative	for years women have fought for their rights.
Non-Argumentative	 once women gained rights in society (including the right to vote invia the representation of the people act 1928, in america inwith the passage of the nineteenth amendment to the united states constitution and in australia in 1902) they were no longer willing to be treated as second class citizens in the home or in the work place.
Non-Argumentative	 but almost a century later has this feminist movement achieved its end goal of complete equality, or are there still battles to be fought by the feminist movement?
Argumentative	Â feminism is still of relevance today , and is indeed needed .
Argumentative	 in the uk , one in four women suffers domestic violence , and an increase in the reporting of rape in the last thirty years has gone alongside a threefold drop in conviction rates .
Argumentative	 in countries such as ireland and malta abortion is still not legal for all women , this can be seen as an important part of equality for woman that has not been achieved yet and needs to be fought for .
Argumentative	 if we take feminism as a global movement then the movement is still of huge importance .
Argumentative	 that 's because u.s. women still earned onlycents on the male dollar in, according to the latest census statistics .
Argumentative	 , that number drops to% for african-american women and% for latinas .
Argumentative	 , these are all real problems , on which feminists continue to campaign - as they should .
Argumentative	 out of overcountries , only a few are currently headed by women .
Argumentative	 women still account for only about% of members of parliament worldwide in.
Argumentative	 some argue that gender quotas should be established to ensure equal input of men and women in parliament .
Argumentative	 therefore , the feminist movement is still needed to fight this battle .
Argumentative	 woman still hold lower position in business , the legal profession and in the world of politics .
Argumentative	 it is therefore hard to argue that the glass ceiling has disintegrated .
Argumentative	 until women hold higher positions in these fields the feminist cause has still not achieved its goals - in seeking to create a world where , amongst other things women can advance up the ladder in their career without being blocked by a glass ceiling and held back in lower positions .
Argumentative	 employers worry when they hire young/middle aged women .
Argumentative	 they fear that after hiring a woman , she will only cost the company money by getting pregnant and going on maternity leave .
Argumentative	 to combat this attitude , maternity and paternity leave should be equal .
Argumentative	 currently , paternity leave is a maximum of two consecutive weeks .
Argumentative	 these two weeks must be taken withindays of the child 's birth .
Argumentative	 this can be contrasted with the long maternity leave that is allowed for .
Argumentative	 women are entitled toweeks of maternity leave from day one of employment .
Argumentative	 women are entitled to maternity pay forweeks if they have been working for their employer forweeks .
Argumentative	 father 's also do not have the right to take time off work to attend antenatal classes , this allowance is for pregnant employees only .
Argumentative	 the feminist cause still has this issue to resolve .
Argumentative	 until paternity leave is offered an employer can safely assume that a woman will be the partner to burden the care of the child and the employer will be the one to bear these costs of maternity leave .
Argumentative	 this gives men an unfair advantage in the workplace as they are a `` safer bet '' for employment .
