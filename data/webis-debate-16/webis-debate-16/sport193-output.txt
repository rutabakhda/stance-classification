Non-Argumentative	major league baseball (mlb), often referred to as “america’s national pastime,” differs from some other team sports—such as american football, rugby, and ice hockey—in largely seeking to avoid forceful physical contact between players.
Non-Argumentative	  the rules of baseball largely prohibit players from attempting to crash into or otherwise physically incapacitate opponents.
Non-Argumentative	  there is, however, one notable exception: collisions at home plate.
Non-Argumentative	these collisions occur when a runner attempts to score by reaching home plate before the catcher (the defensive player responsible for covering home) receives a throw from elsewhere on the field and tags the runner out.
Non-Argumentative	  a catcher is permitted to block the path of the runner trying to score if the catcher has the baseball in his possession or if he is about to receive a throw.
Non-Argumentative	  (otherwise, the catcher may not block home plate.)
Non-Argumentative	  runners, in turn, are permitted to collide with the catcher in order to reach home plate, or to jar the ball loose from the catcher’s possession; either of those outcomes would allow the runner to score.
Non-Argumentative	catchers wear protective gear, including a chest protector, helmet, and shin guards (though they tend to remove their face mask when receiving throws, supposedly because it limits their range of vision).
Non-Argumentative	  runners have only a helmet, though they tend to be running at top speed at the time of a collision, whereas the catcher is stationary and sometimes is unable to observe the runner’s approach because his attention is focused on receiving the throw.
Non-Argumentative	these collisions at home plate have occasionally resulted in serious injury.
Non-Argumentative	  when injuries occur, they are usually—though not always—to the catcher.
Non-Argumentative	  famously, hall of fame player pete rose barrelled into catcher ray fosse in theall star game.
Non-Argumentative	  fosse was injured and was never the same player again, but the collision allowed rose to score the winning run.
Non-Argumentative	  more recently, in may 2011, the san francisco giants’ star catcher buster posey suffered a gruesome, season-ending leg injury when he was hit by scott cousins of the florida marlins.
Non-Argumentative	  cousins scored, helping the marlins win the game.
Non-Argumentative	  but the images of posey’s injury sparked a debate about whether such collisions should be permitted.
Non-Argumentative	those who oppose crashes differ in precisely how they would change the rules, but the most common proposal is to require the runner to slide, just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases.
Non-Argumentative	  another option is to disallow catchers to block runners’ paths.
Non-Argumentative	  most of the arguments in this debate do not depend on the specific proposal.
Argumentative	 baseball is a form of entertainment , and few plays are as entertaining as bang-bang plays , a close call on whether the runner is thrown out , at the plate .
Argumentative	 as a sport that 's often criticized for being too slow and boring -- `` baseball has no clock , '' the saying goes -- it 's important that it hold onto perhaps the most dramatic , vivid play it has to offer .
Argumentative	 one columnist described it this way : `` when , collisions , do occur , they 're exciting .
Argumentative	 we watch to see how well the catcher blocks the plate , how hard the runner slides , and whether the catcher can hold the ball .
Argumentative	 as dangerous as that play may be , it 's exciting to watch . ''
Argumentative	 other sports -- like american football , ice hockey , and rugby -- feature plenty of violent hits .
Argumentative	 baseball has so few of them that when they do happen , they are doubly entertaining .
Argumentative	 it is just not necessary for baseball to prohibit a small dose of something that is extremely common in other sports .
Argumentative	 first , collisions are part of the tradition of baseball .
Argumentative	 they have been part of the game for a very long time .
Argumentative	 fans , players , and managers all expect home plate hits to occur from time to time .
Argumentative	 `` some things are part of the game .
Argumentative	 there 's not a whole lot you can do , '' said red sox catcher jason varitek , who has been on the receiving end of numerous crashes in his career .
Argumentative	 varitek 's manager at the time , terry francona , agreed : `` nobody wants to see anybody get hurt , but you got to play the game . ''
Argumentative	 and former catcher brad ausmus , who had also been hit multiple times in his career , echoed the sentiment : `` , i , t 's part of the game .
Argumentative	 ... when you put on the shin guards and chest protector , you know that if there 's a play at the plate and you 're blocking the plate , you could take a hit at any moment . ''
Argumentative	 as the associated press put it , many people believe `` home plate collisions are as much a part of baseball tradition as peanuts and cracker jacks and the seventh-inning stretch . ''
Argumentative	 second , home plate hits are an essential element of playing the game hard .
Argumentative	 without them , baseball would be much less deserving of its nickname `` hardball . ''
Argumentative	 one commentator notes , `` , an injury is , extremely unfortunate , but it 's the result of a hard-nosed play that is as old as the game itself .
Argumentative	 to take away the potential for a high-intensity , physical play in an otherwise non-physical sport would be a mistake . ''
Argumentative	 in that vein , collisions are also part of the dynamic between the offense and defense that , once removed , will make the game much poorer : `` a baserunner wants to get there at all costs , whereas a catcher wants to protect it at all costs .
Argumentative	 the mutual discomfort that 's evoked in both the catcher and the baserunner as a play at the plate develops is one of the intriguing peculiarities that makes the game of baseball so great . ''
Argumentative	 some hits lead to injury , but the vast majority do not .
Argumentative	 one commentator challenged proponents of a rule change `` to name as many as five mlb catchers in the lastyears who have had their careers ended or shortened as a result of a home plate collision .
Argumentative	 personally , i ca n't think of one . ''
Argumentative	 in posing some -- though not a substantial -- risk , home plate collisions are very much like other aspects of the sport .
Argumentative	 every time a pitcher throws a pitch , the batter could get struck and hurt .
Argumentative	 every time two outfielders converge on a fly ball , there 's a risk of injury .
Argumentative	 baseball , as with many other sports , inherently involves the risk of injury .
Argumentative	 it makes little sense to focus on this play , which does n't often result in significant injury .
Argumentative	 moreover , catchers are trained to position their bodies in ways that minimize the injury risk from crashes .
Argumentative	 if catchers do as they 're trained , they 're very unlikely to get hurt .
Argumentative	 there are two often-discussed ways to change the rules : require the runner to slide , just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases ; or disallow catchers to block runners ' paths .
Argumentative	 each results in an imbalance between the catcher and runner .
Argumentative	 a commentator describes this dynamic very well : `` if major league baseball was to employ a rule stating that runners must avoid contact with the catcher -- similar to the ` slide or avoid ' rule employed in amateur baseball -- it would give the advantage to the catcher .
Argumentative	 the catcher would have the benefit of dictating the course of action that a baserunner must take , and would -- perhaps more importantly -- have peace of mind knowing that there is no chance of an ensuing collision .
Argumentative	 if major league baseball was to make a rule stating that the catcher can not block the plate , the advantage would certainly go to the baserunner , who would enjoy the luxury of a straight path to the most sacred ground on a baseball diamond . ''
Argumentative	 allowing collisions is the fairest , most even match between the catcher and runner .
