Argumentative	Â the union has now passed its 300th birthday and throughout that time scotland has maintained as distinct role and identity .
Argumentative	 this is grounded in a tradition and history that is quite different from that south of the border and includes legal and education systems that have always been separate .
Argumentative	 that has manifested itself in a distinct policy agenda since devolution and areas such as free care for the elderly and the abolition of student tuition fees .
Argumentative	 not only has the policy agenda been different in scotland but so has the model of politics .
Argumentative	 it has seen the emergence of new political parties and a better representation of the diversity within existing ones .
Argumentative	 the contrast between the coalition governments at holyrood , the scottish parliament , where scottish labour and the scottish liberal democrats were allied betweenand, and the internecine warfare going on between conservative and liberal members of the current westminster coalition could not be more stark .
Argumentative	 many of scotland 's problems are grounded in the fact that its potential has consistently been held back .
Argumentative	 because the focus for economic development from a westminster perspective has focused for generations on north sea oil and the coal fields of lanarkshire , huge opportunities were missed and the best and the brightest tended be dragged down south for jobs worthy of their skills .
