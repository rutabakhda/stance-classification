Non-Argumentative	loosely speaking, "smoking bans" mean it is illegal in that country to smoke tobacco in workplaces and other public places, e.g., in hospitals or hotels, to prevent the health problems that can arise as a result of accidentally inhaling other people's cigarette smoke.
Non-Argumentative	 however, of the countries that have smoking bans, there is wide variation in what public places are actually included.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, smoking is banned in all restaurants in berlin, but in austria large establishments are allowed to have separate rooms for smokers1.
Non-Argumentative	 in japan, only some companies (like mcdonald's) ban smoking in their buildings2, whereas in china a ban introduced inmeans smoking is illegal in all enclosed public spaces3.
Non-Argumentative	as well as these differences between countries that do have smoking bans, there are some countries where there are not yet any restrictions on smoking in public places.
Non-Argumentative	 these countries include costa rica4 and jamaica5, where bans are still only in consideration.
Non-Argumentative	because of this variation across the globe, it is important to discuss the reasons for and against having smoking banned in public places, and what kinds of places should be included.
Argumentative	 however, for simplicity's sake, this debate will discuss whether smoking should be banned in all enclosed public places.
Argumentative	the universal declaration of human rights , a list of rights to which the united nations has declared that all human beings should be entitled , states that `` everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family ``.
Argumentative	 more thanstudies carried out worldwide have found that people are at an increased risk of lung cancer if they work or live with somebody who smokes2 .
Argumentative	 given these very serious health risks , it goes against people 's human rights to be exposed to second-hand smoke when they have not chosen to breathe it in .
Argumentative	 to avoid this happening , smoking should be banned in public places , so that non-smokers can be sure that they will not have to breathe in second-hand smoke .
Argumentative	 the health problems that smokers experience cost taxpayers , where healthcare is provided by the government , or the individual , for private healthcare , a lot of money .
Argumentative	 decreasing the number of smokers -- as a result of a reduction in both `` social smokers '' , those who smoke when out with friends , and `` passive smokers '' , those who do not smoke themselves but are exposed to the second-hand smoke of others , -- will lead to a decrease in these healthcare costs .
Argumentative	 this has been reported -- for example -- in arizona , where a study found that hospital admissions due to diagnoses for which there is evidence for a cause by smoking have decreased since the statewide smoking ban , and that costs have thus decreased .
Argumentative	 not being able to smoke in public will make it more difficult for smokers to keep up with their habit .
Argumentative	 for example , if they are no longer able to smoke in the pub , smokers would have to go outside -- possibly in the rain or other uncomfortable weather -- and be away from their non-smoking friends every time they wanted to have a cigarette .
Argumentative	 so , a smoking ban would encourage smokers to smoke less frequently and maybe even give up .
Argumentative	 this can be seen in countries already with smoking bans .
Argumentative	 for example , a study in england found that in the nine months after the smoking ban was introduced , there was a 5.5 % fall in the number of smokers in the country , compared to the much lower fall of 1.6 % in the nine months before the ban .
Argumentative	 this can only be a good thing , since giving up smoking decreases the risk of death , even for those suffering from early stage lung cancer .
Argumentative	 a ban in all public places would be no more difficult to introduce than existing bans preventing smoking in only some public places .
Argumentative	 as long as people are given plenty of notice of changes , as was done in airports in saudi arabia , and the rules are made clear and readily available1 there should be few difficulties in introducing this ban .
