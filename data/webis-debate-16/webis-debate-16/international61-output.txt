Non-Argumentative	africa’s large animals are well documented in history.
Non-Argumentative	 elephants were a source of great fear in the ancient african armies and they became a source of fascination for europeans.
Non-Argumentative	 when they began to explore and colonise the continent, the hides, horns, tusks and pelts of africa’s wildlife became valuable trophies.
Non-Argumentative	unfortunately, hunting and destruction of their environments has led to the extinction of many species, such as the quagga and the western black rhinoceros, and has left others critically endangered.
Non-Argumentative	 there are overcritically endangered species in africa, including african elephants, lions and rhinoceroses.
Non-Argumentative	 to ensure the survival of these animals, nature reserves were established as early as 1898.
Non-Argumentative	 with a focus on conservation, it became illegal to hunt or destroy the environment of the endangered species which lived on the reserve.
Non-Argumentative	 hunting of these animals was officially recognised as ‘poaching’, making it a punishable activity.
Non-Argumentative	 since the beginning of the 21st century however, the numbers of these animals has nosedived.
Non-Argumentative	 tanzania’s elephant population has decreased from 109,419 elephants into 13,084 in 2014.
Non-Argumentative	 this has led to increased calls for a tougher approach towards the protection of endangered animals.
Non-Argumentative	 this mainly suggests a militarised response, but can also include higher levels of passive protection (fencing areas off) and increased punishment in the justice system.
Non-Argumentative	  whether or not a tougher approach will work has become an issue of contention, illustrated by the responses to tanzanian minister khamis kagaski’s call to execute poachers “on the spot”.
Argumentative	 a tougher approach to the protection of animals is needed to prevent their natural habitats from being destroyed by locals .
Argumentative	 as humans expand their agricultural activity in africa they are destroying the environments of endangered animals and pushing others towards being endangered .
Argumentative	 due to an increase in large scale cotton plantations and food crops , the west african lion has seen a marked decrease in population ; numbering less thanin early.
Argumentative	 tougher protection , such as fencing off areas from human activity , has been suggested and has seen success in south africa .
Argumentative	 a stronger , militarised approach is needed as poaching is becoming far more advanced .
Argumentative	 poachers now operate with high-calibre rifles , night vision scopes , silencers and use helicopters to hunt their prey .
Argumentative	 these methods are used particularly against rhinoceroses in south africa , whose horns have become extremely valuable on the asian market for their supposed medical properties .
Argumentative	 in response to this , south african rangers are being given specialised training and use their own aerial surveillance to track poachers down with success , supporting the argument for a militarised response to protect endangered animals .
Argumentative	 endangered animals warrant a tougher degree of protection in africa as they have notable cultural significance .
Argumentative	 some groups believe that african elephants have mystic powers attached to them and have coveted them for centuries .
Argumentative	 african lions have been depicted on the coat of arms for states and institutions both past and present .
Argumentative	 they are intrinsically linked with africa 's past and its identity .
Argumentative	 the extinction of these animals , therefore , would have a negative cultural impact and should be prevented .
Argumentative	 stronger protection of animals should be implemented to reduce the funding for terrorist groups .
Argumentative	 certain terrorist organisations use the illegal ivory and horn trade as funding for their operations .
Argumentative	 al-shabaab , the lord 's resistance army , lra , and the sudanese janjaweed all use the illicit trade as a source of income , with the former using the trade for% of its expenditure .
Argumentative	 this enables them to carry out attacks such as thewestgate siege in kenya .
Argumentative	 tougher protection of endangered animals would reduce the ability of these groups to fund themselves .
Argumentative	 in turn , this would decrease their operational capability , increasing stability in africa .
Argumentative	 a major failing in current anti-poaching operations is that the poachers are rarely prosecuted .
Argumentative	 african legal systems rarely prioritise poaching as a serious crime , with offenders usually receiving trivial fines1 .
Argumentative	 one of the major reasons for the western black rhinoceros ' extinction inwas the complete lack of sentencing for any of the poachers who were captured .
Argumentative	 the system also fails to prosecute the brains behind many of the operations due to poor investigative methods .
Argumentative	 this creates an impression in the minds of the poachers that they can operate with impunity .
