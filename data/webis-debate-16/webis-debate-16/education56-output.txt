Non-Argumentative	the question of the best way to raise children is one which is widely debated in all liberal democracies.
Non-Argumentative	 it is also commonly believed that decisions regarding childcare should be left to parents in the private sphere of the home.
Non-Argumentative	 typically, states become involved in questions concerning parenting only when there have been serious failings on the part of parents - such as cases of abuse or neglect.
Non-Argumentative	 however, given the increasing concern over bad behaviour in schools, youth crime, substance abuse and a perceived lack of respect for society on behalf of young people, questions may be raised as to whether unaided parents have the competence required to raise children and whether they should enjoy absolute freedom when raising their children.
Non-Argumentative	 a radical proposal is to require that people who want to become parents obtain a licence (just as they do before if they want to drive a car).
Non-Argumentative	 how this measure would be implemented in the case of natural reproduction (as opposed to adoption, custody, or assisted reproduction) is controversial.
Non-Argumentative	parenting classes are a possible solution to assist new parents and parents who encounter difficulties in raising their children.
Non-Argumentative	 should classes be offered on a voluntary basis or made compulsory for all prospective parents?
Non-Argumentative	 is the state justified in using preventive measures or should it intervene only when problems occur?
Non-Argumentative	 at present no state requires compulsory classes for all would-be parents, but the british government has shown interest in “early intervention” strategies including parenting classes for families where children are thought likely to grow up posing problems for society.
Non-Argumentative	 one interesting proposal is that the state can offer parenting classes to all children in school as part of their compulsory education.
Non-Argumentative	 this measure would make people aware at a very early stage of their education of the skills and knowledge base required to deal effectively with children.
Argumentative	the arguments below concern the proposal to make parenting classes compulsory to all would-be parents, and the proposal to offer specific parenting classes to parents who experience problems in raising their children.
Argumentative	parenting classes would need to be compulsory for a number of reasons .
Argumentative	 firstly - for all of the subjectivity regarding parenting -- there are clearly some cases where bad parenting is responsible for some of the child 's failings .
Argumentative	 a morbidly obeseyear old with a criminal record , no school qualifications and poor health has , almost certainly , been let down by his or her parents .
Argumentative	 however the state has no way of knowing in advance as to which parents will struggle in this manner -- hence it is better if the classes are for everyone .
Argumentative	 furthermore , it seems fair to assume that parents who are somehow socially excluded , wilfully ignorant or suffering some other acute difficulty in raising children , would probably be less likely to take the active step of attending voluntary classes in the first place .
Argumentative	 according to a report on uk children 's services referral to get help tends to be self-referral by those who have less need whereas those with higher needs have to be referred by others before they will accept the helpthus voluntary classes may actually be structurally biased to miss the cases in which they are most needed .
Argumentative	 a compulsory system is likely to offer far better outcomes across society the state has a strong moral , practical and financial interest in the raising of its future citizens .
Argumentative	 this is why most liberal democracies offer extensive and costly child support systems , including child-support payments , free nursery care , parental leave arrangements , to aid parents in raising young people who can be active and respectful members of society .
Argumentative	 louise casey , government respect co-ordinator , argues that the best results come from preventative action : `` i think we have got to do everything to make sure we are tackling not just anti-social behaviour today , but preventing the next generation of people growing up with signs of anti-social behaviour in the future . ''
Argumentative	 1 compulsory parenting classes could be a means to ensure the cohesion and prosperity of its future generations by raising the standard of parenting they receive .
Argumentative	 in our times , when contraception is widely available and affordable , reproduction should be an active and responsible choice on the part of individuals .
Argumentative	 parenting classes would be instrumental in ensuring that people reflect upon their decision to have children and understand the implications of their choice.
Argumentative	moreover , if the ` lifestyle choice ' of having children is supported by the state , through tax breaks , benefits and entitlements , then it would seem that the state is justified in applying some minimal conditions to people who wish to benefit from its support .
Argumentative	 so parenting classes would be a means for the state to safeguard its interest in having responsible citizens .1 currently , information about parenting is scarce , patchy and inconsistent .
Argumentative	 it would benefit all if up-to-date parenting information provided by medical staff , psychologists , nutritionists , educators and so on , were made accessible and standardised : all parents would receive the same basic and essential information .
Argumentative	 and information is always valuable and often appreciated by those who receive it .
Argumentative	 the charity barnardo 's argues that those who attended their classes ` were unanimously positive about the impact of courses and were clear that attending them provided them with new skills and confidence in their parenting ability . '
Argumentative	 1parenting classes would provide up-to-date and standardized information useful to guide prospective parents ' behaviour and it would not amount to imposing one model of parenting on all .
