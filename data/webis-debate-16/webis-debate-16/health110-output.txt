Non-Argumentative	teenage pregnancy rates are on the rise, and contraceptives are often hailed as the underlying cause.
Non-Argumentative	 however, few people agree on why contraceptives might be causing an increase in pregnancy rates.
Non-Argumentative	 some believe that a lack of contraceptives has led to more unprotected sex among young girls who choose to take that risk; others claim that the availability of contraceptives encourages young girls to underestimate the emotional and physical impact of having sex at a young age.
Non-Argumentative	 it is very difficult to reach an absolute conclusion either way because of the difficulties of gathering data about whether underage girls have engaged in sexual activity.
Non-Argumentative	 they may refuse to tell, or falsely say that they have been sexually active as a result of peer pressure to have sex.
Non-Argumentative	            a high teenage pregnancy rate damages to the girls’ career or life prospects, and for society it often creates a financial and social burden to support the children and young mothers.
Non-Argumentative	 while doctors are bound by the principles of medical ethics to aid their patients as far as possible, providing contraceptives to under-age girls can be seen as undermining the purpose of the law against under-age intercourse because it provides a ‘safe’ way for them to break that law.
Non-Argumentative	 it can also put doctors in an uncomfortable position if they feel that the girl will have intercourse without contraception if they refuse to prescribe it, at which point they may feel that they are failing to help the patient to avoid physical and mental health issues which could potentially result from unprotected sex.
Non-Argumentative	            the mechanism for this debate is that doctors should be able to prescribe contraception to young girls, even if they have not yet reached the legal age of consent, as long as they satisfy certain conditions already laid out by medical authorities such as the british medical association.
Non-Argumentative	 in this case, under the rules for informed consent, the patient must be ‘aware of’ and have ‘genuinely understood the hazards and benefits of various methods of contraception.’
Non-Argumentative	  doctors must also ‘make sure that patients are able to use the chosen method properly and can recognise and cope with side effects.’
Non-Argumentative	 this mechanism does not impose an absolute limit to contraceptive prescriptions based on age, but rather assesses each patient as an individual to ascertain whether that personally are ready for a sexual relationship.
Non-Argumentative	 this upholds medical ethics in that the doctor’s concern should be ‘the welfare of the patient concerned’ – basing individual prescriptions on individual need – rather than imposing a uniform age restriction.
Argumentative	 refusing to prescribe contraceptives for girls below the age of consent assumes that no under-age girls can make an informed decision to choose a sexual relationship .
Argumentative	 medical advice and prescriptions should be given on an individual , rather than uniform , basis .
Argumentative	 as long as these girls meet the requirements for consent laid out by the relevant medical authority , there should be no reason for contraceptives should be denied to them .
Argumentative	 the decision of whether an individual is ready to engage in a sexual relationship is a purely personal one ; refusing contraceptives places them at unnecessarily medical risk , both physically and mentally , and does not adhere to the duty of care by doctors for their patients .
Argumentative	 although it is almost impossible to absolutely prevent underage sex , as already shown by rising teen pregnancy rates in the us , the uk and across europe , it is possible to encourage safe sex .
Argumentative	 sex education programmes which teach abstinence rarely seem to deter sexual activity or prevent teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections .
Argumentative	 however , studies researching the effect of providing contraceptives in schools have found that there was ` no increase in sexual activity ' .
Argumentative	 if this principle was extended to include the many different types of contraception available by prescription , this could feasibly help to lower high teenage pregnancy rates ; for example , the prescribed pill has a higher efficiency rate than condoms , which are often available in schools or clinics but used inefficiently .
Argumentative	 devices like the iud also remove any problems of girls forgetting to take their pills on time .
Argumentative	 allowing under-age girls to be able to talk to a doctor and receive the form of contraception which is best fitting for them would actively tackle rising teen pregnancy rates .
Argumentative	 the decision to have sex is an incredibly subjective one .
Argumentative	 some girls might be ready at, others may not be ready until they are in their twenties or older .
Argumentative	 in fact , the age where girls enter puberty has become progressively younger ; so , whereasmight be considered an average age to begin puberty , some girls can begin puberty as young asyears old .
Argumentative	 however , in either case or early or of late development , the subjective decision of sexual maturity should not be permitted or outlawed by a system which takes no personal account of the individual ; the only person who can judge if they are ready is the girl herself .
Argumentative	 disallowing doctors to prescribe contraceptives to young girls impedes their duties of medical ethics .
Argumentative	 the principle of beneficence instructs that doctors should do good for their patients .
Argumentative	 if a young girl is in danger of an unplanned pregnancy and the potential medical complications which accompany it , a doctor should not deny her help if she asks for it and is medically suitable for the contraceptives .
Argumentative	 for example , she must be within the parameters for weight and blood pressure to take the combined pill , without undue likelihood of blood clots and other potential risks .
Argumentative	 it is contradictory to give doctors the right to judge their patient 's best interests , but simultaneously prevent them from acting in their professional capacity .
Argumentative	 by visiting the doctor , young girls have more access to information which they might not get from their school sex education .
Argumentative	 given that , in the united states , there is ` no federal mandate to teach sex education ' in public schools , and ` less than half of all public schools ... offer information on how to obtain birth control ' , it is patently clear that the current educational system fails to address the needs of young adolescents in this respect .
Argumentative	 a doctor 's surgery or clinic is a more private environment for young girls to ask for clarification , without intimidation from male or female peers , which encourages education and makes sure that the girls are more fully informed before they have sex .
