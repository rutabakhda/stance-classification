Non-Argumentative	in its preamble, the rome statute of the international criminal court explicitly stated that its objectives were not limited to investigating and punishing those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes of aggression.
Non-Argumentative	 “determined to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes”, the states parties to the statute clearly envisaged the court’s punitive powers to have at least some deterrent effect.
Non-Argumentative	in one obvious sense, successful prosecution of criminals prevents them from committing crimes during the term of their imprisonment.
Non-Argumentative	  however, the court’s power to prosecute perpetrators can be conceived as having potential deterrent effects that are specific or general.
Non-Argumentative	 if a period of imprisonment already imposed on an individual has the effect of deterring that same person from committing any further crimes, this would be a case of quite specific deterrence.
Non-Argumentative	 but when this more limited deterrence also influences the potential for many others to commit similar crimes, deterrence begins to operate in the much more general sense expressed in the rome statute.
Non-Argumentative	 in this general sense, a minimal level of deterrence would be expected to depend on widely publicizing the court’s jurisdictional authority, past and present investigations and successful prosecutions.
Non-Argumentative	  other attempts at more specific deterrence have been evident in occasional warnings issued by the icc prosecutor.
Non-Argumentative	  as the icc functions as a court of ‘last resort’, it only begins proceedings when national or regional authorities have failed to take appropriate action.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore, while the prosecutor may sometimes attempt to directly deter potential crimes by issuing warnings addressed at those already suspected of committing crimes, warnings might also be targeted towards the local authorities.
Non-Argumentative	 an example of this approach occurred in the prosecutor’s press release onjanuary 2013, urging malian authorities to “put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses” by malian forces.
Non-Argumentative	one of the difficulties in this debate centres on the question of the icc’s potential to deter would-be criminals i. e. those who may otherwise have been influenced to join or collaborate with militia groups whose members have been committing atrocities with impunity.
Non-Argumentative	 for practical reasons the icc has intentionally sought to restrict its prosecutions to those “most responsible” for the crimes committed.
Non-Argumentative	  this makes it difficult to gather evidence for or against propositions about the number of persons who may have considered participating in such criminal acts but were ultimately deterred by the threat of icc prosecution.
Argumentative	 while the icc has the power to issue arrest warrants , it does not have the coercive powers to ensure that those warrants are followed .
Argumentative	 despite the fact that states that are parties to the rome statute are obliged to co-operate with the directions of the court , there have been many instances where such states have failed to pursue those indicted .
Argumentative	 cases that have been referred to the icc by the united nations security council allows the court to extend its jurisdiction to include un member states that are not parties to the rome statute .
Argumentative	 this enabled the icc to issue an international warrant for the arrest of sudan 's president al-bashir .
Argumentative	 yet several of these countries obliged to arrest him have refused when the opportunities have arisen .
Argumentative	 since becoming operational in marchthe icc has only had one case resulting in a conviction and it is currently being appealed .
Argumentative	 despite being found guilty of the war crime of recruiting and forcing child soldiers to fight and kill , thomas lubanga was sentenced to justyears imprisonment .
Argumentative	 lubanga was arrested and sent to the court in march.
Argumentative	 this single icc conviction and the light sentence imposed are hardly sufficient to deter other warlords from using child soldiers .
Argumentative	 six years later , in the same country where lubanga 's crimes occurred , thousands of child soldiers are being recruited by various armed groups .
Argumentative	 by prosecuting only those leaders deemed ` most responsible ' for the crimes in question , the icc is effectively allowing lower-ranked perpetrators to commit crimes with impunity .
Argumentative	 these rank and file troops generally have little awareness or understanding of international criminal laws .
Argumentative	 furthermore , just as local domestic laws fail to deter offenders who often commit crimes with little thought of being punished , distant icc threats are even less likely to deter those whose actions are easily manipulated and controlled by militia leaders .
Argumentative	 child soldiers , in particular , have often been drugged before going into combat .
