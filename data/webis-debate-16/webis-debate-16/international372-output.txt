Non-Argumentative	africa is known as a continent in conflict; it is sometimes called ‘the dark continent’.
Non-Argumentative	 the creation of an african union standing army would be one way of attempting to create peace on the continent.
Non-Argumentative	 a standing army is a permanent, often professional, army.
Non-Argumentative	  setting up such a permanent force for the au would be the first permanent force for an international organisation that is not made up of forces seconded from national armies.
Non-Argumentative	 the au constitutive act does not authorise such a creation but does have objectives of achieving “greater unity and solidarity”, accelerating political integration, promoting peace, and a principle to “establishment of a common defence policy for the african continent”.
Non-Argumentative	 however as with any international organisation a core principle is “sovereign equality” and “non-interference” this force is primarily going to be about peacekeeping and peace-making.
Non-Argumentative	 this will be in response to the use of “the right of member states to request intervention from the union in order to restore peace and security” but the union could also “intervene in a member state pursuant to a decision of the assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity”.
Non-Argumentative	the african union has been active in peacekeeping.
Non-Argumentative	 since the end ofthe au’s peace and security council has had responsibility for maintaining peace in africa.
Non-Argumentative	 it is the body that decides on interventions by the au.
Non-Argumentative	 since then the au has been most notably involved in the conflict in somalia but has also been in sudan, burundi and the central african republic.
Non-Argumentative	 also inthe au decided to create the african standby force.
Non-Argumentative	 this consists of five regional brigades of slightly overtroops which should be available for rapid deployment anywhere in africa.
Non-Argumentative	 these however are multinational brigades that remain in their home countries armed forces rather than a permanent au force.
Non-Argumentative	 it has regularly been delayed so it might seem odd to propose something more ambitious.
Non-Argumentative	 an au army would however avoid some of the problems associated with this force of coordinating from numerous different forces and ensuring they all remain up to standard by centralising.
Argumentative	*throughout the debate, the following abbreviations have been used:unsc= united nations security councilunga= united nations general assemblyau= african unionwld= western liberal democracies  it is clear that africa can not rely on the international community to solve its conflicts .
Argumentative	 in order to be more independent , what the african union needs is a standing army , which can intervene whenever there is a crisis .
Argumentative	 first of all , when looking at statistics , having dipped in the 1990s the number of conflicts is growing once more , the most recent events of mali and the algeria serving as a perfect example  .
Argumentative	 `` following a year  that signalled hope for a more peaceful development , the number of conflicts increased by nearlypercent ``  .
Argumentative	 this has served to demonstrate africa 's need for a force to engage in peace keeping and peace making .
Argumentative	 despite the growing need for peacekeeping forces , there is reason to believe that the help coming from the international community will be insufficient .
Argumentative	 the dysfunctional structure of the unsc , the body which approves all major international interventions .
Argumentative	 russia and china , two countries which have a non interventionist approach on foreign policy , have veto power in this body ; which means a lot of possible interventions get vetoed .
Argumentative	 the examples of syria and sudan prove the inability of the international community to intervene in crisis situations   .
Argumentative	 the primary purpose of international organisations is to resolve conflicts between members .
Argumentative	 in the case of the au its first stated objective is `` achieve greater unity and solidarity between the african countries '' .
Argumentative	 the main threat to this unity as well as peace in the continent is rebel groups and internal conflict .
Argumentative	 groups for whom the only goal is wealth or to get into power in their own country .
Argumentative	  an au force 's role would therefore be to defeat these armed groups and to engage in peacekeeping .
Argumentative	 an au force is always going to be better at handling these situations due to its legitimacy in africa .
Argumentative	 in many african countries , the west is perceived as an imperialist power , due to their colonial past and as a result there is a serious lack of trust between the parties .
Argumentative	 an au force will also be better than any local force as a peacekeeper as it will , like the un , be seen as being independent while also being african .
Argumentative	 it would also , like the rebels , be able to cross borders .
Argumentative	 such a force would therefore be able to hunt down rebels like the lords resistance army which has so far evaded destruction by moving between uganda , southern sudan , and dr congo .
Argumentative	 countries desire to have influence among the international community .
Argumentative	 states gain this influence in all sorts of way ; economic wealth , high technology , charismatic leaders , or a military power .
Argumentative	 having an au standing army would help provide africa with influence ; it would show the unity of the continent and its willingness to work together .
Argumentative	 a lot of influence is about perception and this is something that an au army can change ; africa will no longer be a continent that can not act for itself even on its own soil but will instead be taking the burden off more established peacekeeping countries .
Argumentative	 this is an important gain as influence is gained by being able to bring something to the table .
Argumentative	 having an au force means the au will always be able to bring resources and capabilities when there is a crisis in africa .
Argumentative	 the default position will no longer be to look to the un , or even to france and the uk for peacekeepers when there is a crisis in africa but to the au itself .
Argumentative	 but an au army would have other benefits too as the continent would be a better investment opportunity if there is an army guaranteeing security and ensuring peace .
Argumentative	 the continent 's economic influence may also therefore expand as a result .
