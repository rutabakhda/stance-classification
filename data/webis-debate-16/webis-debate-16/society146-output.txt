Non-Argumentative	an amnesty can be defined as ‘a general pardon, esp for offences against a government’.
Non-Argumentative	 in the case of illegal immigrants this would be for the offence of entering and remaining in a country illegally and would in most cases not apply to those who have committed other crimes so there is usually an emphasis that an amnesty would only be for those who are law abiding – except for being in the country illegally.
Non-Argumentative	 amnesties may be granted by the executive or the legislature for a country, in the case of a general amnesty for migrants this would probably need both and would likely be a highly controversial move in any country.
Non-Argumentative	 politics about illegal immigrants are likely to be more highly charged in countries that already have a lot of migrants (whether legal or illegal) which means that migration is considered an social and economic issue that affects much of the electorate.
Non-Argumentative	despite their potential for controversy amnesties for illegal immigrants are not uncommon.
Non-Argumentative	 poland granted an amnesty for illegal immigrants in 2011, newt gingrich has made some kind of amnesty part of his campaign for the republican nomination for the presidency in the united states and it was also a campaign pledge in the in the uk general election by the liberal democrats in 2010.
Non-Argumentative	 while the uk has never granted a general amnesty and the united states has only had one in some countries they are quite common; france and portugal have offered two each, italy five and spain six amnesties.
Non-Argumentative	the proposition in the debate would have to give some idea of what conditions they are attaching to the amnesty and whether there are any limitations on it.
Non-Argumentative	 often more there are proposals for more limited amnesties rather than a general amnesty in order to reduce the political backlash that could result from a more indiscriminate policy.
Argumentative	 amnesty is the only way to deal with the fundamental problem behind immigration ; the developed world much richer and has more jobs available than the developing world .
Argumentative	 for example the usa has a per capita gdp of $ 48,100 by comparison mexico 's is only $ 15,100 using ppp the gap with the central american countries to the south of mexico is even starker with guatemalan gdp/capita at $ 5,000 .
Argumentative	 not surprisingly the usa far outstrips the central american countries in the human development index ; the us is 4th , mexico 57th and guatemala 131st .
Argumentative	 so long as there is such diversity of income and opportunity immigrants will keep coming , and this will continue no matter what the state that is receiving migrants does in an attempt to deter them .
Argumentative	 amnesties will help allow labour to get to where it is needed , through nafta the us is integrating north america but it is specifically excluding labour from this integration while tightening border controls at the mexican border .
Argumentative	 amnesties would help to counter-act the problems caused by leaving labour as the resource that is not allowed to cross borders and so provide benefits to both the host economy and the country of origin for the migrants .
Argumentative	 this is because the migrants will send back remittances that will help to develop their home nation and they themselves may well return after developing new skills that can then be put to use at home .
Argumentative	 migrants , including illegal migrants , are necessary for the economies of rich countries .
Argumentative	 there are schemes run by these countries that allow the migration of skilled workers for jobs where there is a skills shortage in the native population , for example the united kingdom takes in a lot of migrants to work as doctors and migrants .
Argumentative	 however these schemes fail to acknowledge that migrants are also vital for unskilled jobs which native workers are often unwilling to take ; for example jobs in catering , picking crops and cleaning .
Argumentative	 approximately 6.3 million illegal immigrants are working in the usa , and these are benefiting the economy .
Argumentative	 the federal reserve bank of dallas says `` the pace of recent u.s. economic growth would have been impossible without immigration .
Argumentative	 since, immigrants have contributed to job growth in three main ways : they fill an increasing share of jobs overall , they take jobs in labor-scarce regions , and they fill the types of jobs native workers often shun . ''
Argumentative	 amnesties are necessary to ensure the economy keeps benefiting from these workers .
Argumentative	 much of the rich world is aging , and in a few cases is close to having a declining population .
Argumentative	 as a result the size of the available workforce will decrease .
Argumentative	 for example in germany bya third of the population will be over, and over the nextyears will as a result loose five million workers from the current workforce ofmillion .
Argumentative	 while increasing retirement age can mean that these reductions in the size of the workforce come later to maintain the size of the workforce immigration or a rapid increase in birth rate is necessary .
Argumentative	 these countries in order to maintain the size of their economies will therefore either have to rapidly increase productivity , which itself may not be easy as they are already the most productive nations , or else allow migrants to fill the gaps in the labour force .
Argumentative	 at the same time there will be an increase in some jobs that rely on migrants such as care workers to help look after the increasing number of elderly .
