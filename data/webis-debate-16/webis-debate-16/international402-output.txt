Non-Argumentative	the state of bosnia & herzegovina is formally divided into two entities the republika srpska [hereafter referred to as rs] (composed primarily of ethnic serbs) and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina [fbh] (composed primarily of ethnic croats and bosnian muslims or bosniaks).
Non-Argumentative	 this division dates from the time of its independence from yugoslavia induring the yugoslav wars and was designed to end the fighting and promote peace and reconciliation.
Non-Argumentative	 the conflict was ended by the dayton agreement of 21st november 1995.
Non-Argumentative	 the agreement set an inter-ethnic boundary line which closely followed the front lines at the end of the war with a few adjustments particularly in the case of sarajevo.
Non-Argumentative	these two entities are largely self-governing within their own territories, with their own parliaments, presidents, constitutions, police forces and even their own postal systems.
Non-Argumentative	 cooperation between the two parts within federal state structures is limited and characterised by gridlock and division.
Non-Argumentative	many within the republika srpska seek independence from bosnia-herzegovina and potentially even union with serbia.
Argumentative	Â the right to self-determination is a basic human right which underpins the legitimacy of the nation-state .
Argumentative	 where a large group people do not feel represented or accepted by a state and thus do not consent to its rule , the states control over that people becomes illegitimate .
Argumentative	 the right to national self-determination is enshrined with the un charter and formed the basis for the independence of slovenia , croatia , macedonia , kosovo and montenegro .
Argumentative	 kosovo became formally independent from serbia inand montenegro became independent from serbia inas a result of referenda within those territories .
Argumentative	 if these states and the many , many others which previously achieved independence have a right to self-determination why does n't rs ?
Argumentative	 to deny some groups of people access to self-determination is hypocritical and unjust .
Argumentative	 the existing state structure does not work , because it requires agreement between the representatives of rs and the fbh , given the fundamentally divergent aims and opinions of the two sides compromise is almost impossible leading to perpetual gridlock on basic issues such as policing and education .
Argumentative	 this gridlock can be shown by the fifteen months it took for bosnia and herzegovina to form a government , and even then a compromise was only reached due to financial pressure from the imf and eu .
Argumentative	 the constituents peoples , serbs , croats and bosniaks , live almost entirely in separate segregated areas with very little communal intermixing .
Argumentative	 they already essentially live in separate states but without the ability to actually direct their own affairs or receive international recognition .
Argumentative	 it should be remembered that the bosnian serbs have already voted ponce for secession as in a referendum in novemberin areas which were serb ethnic 96.4 % voted for an independent state within the then yugoslav federation .
Argumentative	 where groups of people do not identify with the state they are less likely to be willing to invest in more generous state services since they do feel that peoples with whom they have no affinity will benefit from them .
Argumentative	 conversely , where people feel like the state is mostly composed of people like them , they are more willing to invest in education , healthcare and a welfare state .
Argumentative	 these things will ultimately significantly improve the lives of the people in each new state and lead to stronger states than the one that exists now .
Argumentative	 for example the scandinavian states , norway , denmark , sweden and finland with their largely homogenous societies are also associated with very high levels of social happiness and generous welfare provision .
