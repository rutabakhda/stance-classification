Non-Argumentative	 common agricultural policy (cap) was founded in late 1950s as a mechanism against further food shortages in europe.
Non-Argumentative	 european leaders envisioned the cap as a system of subsidies for damaged agricultural industry still affected by residues of wwii with several main goals stated in the treaty of rome, article:1.
Non-Argumentative	     to increase productivity, by promoting technical progress and ensuring the optimum use of the factors of production, in particular labour;2.
Non-Argumentative	     to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community;3.
Non-Argumentative	     to stabilise markets;4.
Non-Argumentative	     to secure availability of supplies;5.
Non-Argumentative	     to provide consumers with food at reasonable prices.
Non-Argumentative	the ways how to reach these goals varied – several policies ranging from interventions of eu when the price of goods is under certain level to production quotas to avoid overproduction and direct subsidies paid to farmers.
Non-Argumentative	 however, these policies are only one part of cap as whole.
Non-Argumentative	 the second pillar of cap is the rural development programs aimed at improvement of competitiveness of agricultural and forestry sector, improving the environment and the countryside, diversification of rural economy and implementation of local development strategies through public-private partnerships.
Non-Argumentative	.
Non-Argumentative	nonetheless, cap faced a lot of criticism during the years.
Non-Argumentative	 one of the main scandals were so-called mountains of butter and lakes of wine and milk which were in the 80s a result of eu purchasing the goods in order to maintain the reasonable market prices.
Non-Argumentative	 however, in recent years there were signs that the butter mountains can be back.
Non-Argumentative	 among other criticised aspects were the effects of cap on environment, unfairness to new member states of eu, hurting of smaller farms among others.
Non-Argumentative	 the critique escalated to such degree that insweden became first eu country to take position that all eu subsidies should be abolished.
Argumentative	 currently cap costs the european union approx .
Argumentative	 40 % of its whole budget .
Argumentative	 however , this money is used to provide subsidies for industry that only employs less than% of workforce and creates less than% of gdp .
Argumentative	 we can easily assume that nearly half of eu 's budget can be used more effectively and can , instead , be used to support other , more potential industries which can boost the currently sluggish economic growth .
Argumentative	 moreover , the subsidies for european farmers are so high they can contribute up to% of farmers ' pre-tax income .
Argumentative	 no other industry has such privileges -- when european coal and iron industry became uncompetitive and needed to be slimmed down , the european union did not subsidise the industry to such degree even though such action could have saved thousands of jobs .
Argumentative	 not only are the largest recipients of cap western countries -- france , spain and germany - also the payments per hectare of arable lands differ significantly between new and old members of eu .
Argumentative	 the new members of eu with their economies often struggling and more dependent on agriculture , as is the case of poland , bulgaria or romania , need more monetary support compared to their western counterparts to produce food of same quality and be competitive in eu market .
Argumentative	 however , the payments for hectare of land vary from$ in greece to less than$ in latvia .
Argumentative	 these different conditions undermine the eu 's ethos of fairness and equality of countries .
Argumentative	 the current model of cap results in major oversupply of food and beverages .
Argumentative	 inthe stockpiles of cereals rising to810 tons while the surplus of wine was about 2.3 million hectolitres .
Argumentative	 this excess of supply is then often sold to developing countries for prices so low that the local producers can not cope with them .
Argumentative	 the low prices of european food can be attributed to the higher efficiency of producing food because of use of advanced technologies as well as the cap .
Argumentative	 agriculture makes a small fraction of gdp in europe , but in developing countries of africa or asia it is entirely different with large numbers dependent on much smaller plots of land .
Argumentative	 hence , the consequences of cap and high production in the eu can be the rise of unemployment and decline of self-sufficiency of these affected countries .
Argumentative	 the cap as originally proposed was aimed to support small , local , family farmers which have difficulties with sustaining their business in competitive environment .
Argumentative	 the conference in stresa inthat helped define cap 's objectives stated `` given the importance of family structures in european agriculture ... all means should be taken in order to strengthen the economic and competitive capacity of the family enterprise . ''
Argumentative	 however , the current model of cap gives direct payments to farmers according to area of their farms .
Argumentative	 that means that the major recipients of cap are actually the biggest players in agricultural industry .
Argumentative	 according to economist ,% of the subsidies go to% of the richest farmers .
Argumentative	 therefore , the money is spent to support large companies and wealthy landowners who could easily compete in eu market even without such abhorrent support from eu taxpayers .
