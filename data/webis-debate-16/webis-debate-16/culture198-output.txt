Non-Argumentative	the term child performer includes young singers, actors, dancers, gymnasts, etc. these children are exceptions to theconvention concerning minimum age for admission to employment, and so may be paid for their work, as long as they have permits that “limit the number of hours during which and prescribe the conditions in which employment or work is allowed”.
Non-Argumentative	 however, some feel that child performers ought not to be such an exception, and that it should be ensured that no child under the minimum age for admission to employment be allowed to partake in paid work of any kind.
Non-Argumentative	currently, child performers are protected by various laws, for example laws which dictate how many hours the child may work and how much education they must receive (both of which vary by country), or how much of their pay must be reserved for the child themselves (e.g., canada’s “coogan law”).
Non-Argumentative	 yet some believe these laws do not provide adequate protection, and that these child performers represent a group (and a group which is on the increase) whose rights are being undermined.
Non-Argumentative	 a subset believes that the only way to protect these children completely is to ban child performers outright.
Argumentative	 spending so much time either performing or training limits the amount of formal education the child can receive .
Argumentative	 for example , in the uk and other countries , child performers are only required to be educated for three hours each day .
Argumentative	 additionally , the focus on the specialised skill of the child , e.g. , acting , dancing , etc. , may detract from their family 's or their own interest in formal education .
Argumentative	 children are generally considered to be too young to make important decisions for themselves , and so decision-making falls to parents , teachers , etc, for child performers , there are additional decision-makers : their agents .
Argumentative	 since agents benefit financially from the child 's getting a role or doing well in a sporting event , there is a definite risk of exploitation .
Argumentative	 exploitation can also come from parents , as in the famous case of american television child stars jackie coogan and gary coleman , who both sued their parents for spending the money they had earned as children or of macaulay culkin , who blocked his parents from having access to his earnings .
Argumentative	 even experienced adults can find it difficult to deal with stage fright or performance anxiety .
Argumentative	 children , more emotionally vulnerable than adults by nature , should not be exposed to this sort of pressure .
Argumentative	 this is especially true in situations where the child is being paid for their performance , since the added necessity to perform well can lead to even more pressure .
Argumentative	 although suicide among children is rare , it is believed often to occur as a result of the child feeling like she is under too much pressure , or failing to meet the expectations of others .
Argumentative	 there are also consequences that continue long past the child has stopped performing ; former child actors often have the problem as young adults as feeling as having already ` peaked ' and find themselves without a sense of drive or ambition or a coherent adult identity , consequentially they often suffer from substance abuse and addiction children involved at a professional level in sports are at a higher risk than their peers of physical problems like breaking bones .
Argumentative	 in some cases , these physical problems can be fatal ; e.g. , julissa gomez , who died from complications of a vaulting injury contracted when she wasin warm-ups for a gymnastics competition .
Argumentative	 even in careers like acting and dancing there are risks for child performers .
Argumentative	 actors and dancers are usually encouraged to stay thin , often to an unhealthy degree .
Argumentative	 because children are particularly vulnerable , they are more susceptible to the perils of over-exercising for athletes and eating disorders for performers .
Argumentative	 it has been found , for example , that girls who dance in their childhood are more likely than their peers to develop anorexia nervosa in later life .
Argumentative	 lena zavaroni , the childhood winner of ` opportunity knocks ' in the's , struggled with eating disorders for all of her life and died aged.
Argumentative	 with the damage eating disorders can do to a person 's body , it should be illegal to expose children to such risks .
Argumentative	 child performers are exposed to a much higher level of responsibility than their peers , without the maturity to deal with it .
Argumentative	 they may be exposed to sex , drugs , or alcohol , in a context too far removed from a normal life that they do n't learn adequate coping mechanisms .
Argumentative	 it is no surprise that many child performers `` burn out '' by the time they reach adulthood , often experiencing problems long before , as in the case of actress drew barrymore , who entered rehab at the age of.
Argumentative	 children should not be encouraged to enter into these adult worlds of acting , modeling , dancing , etc, michael jackson attributed his obsession with children and childhood as a consequence of having missed out on a childhood himself .
Argumentative	 child performers are currently protected by laws about all sorts of things from the minimum amount of education they may get to their pay and how many hours they can work .
Argumentative	 many of these laws would be much more difficult to enforce than a blanket ban .
Argumentative	 it would be simple to enforce as child performers would in most cases be easy to spot -- as they are performing for the public .
Argumentative	 the government could then bring charges against those who are employing the child and fine them .
