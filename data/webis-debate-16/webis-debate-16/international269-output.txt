Non-Argumentative	on december 19th, 2008, a ceasefire between israel and gaza, under the control of hamas, ended without renewal, and hamas' al-qassam brigade, amongst other militant groups, increased rocket attacks targeted at israel.
Non-Argumentative	 on december 27th, 2008, israel launched an air bombing campaign that allegedly targeted militant bases of operations, which killed hundreds of gazan civilians as well.
Non-Argumentative	 on january 3rd, israel launched a ground invasion of gaza, codenamed operation cast lead.
Non-Argumentative	 on january 5, idf forces began operating in the densely populated urban centers of gaza.
Non-Argumentative	during the last week of the offensive (fromjanuary), israel mostly hit targets it had damaged previously and struck palestinian rocket-launching units.
Non-Argumentative	 hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against southern israel, reaching the major cities of beersheba and ashdod for the first time during the conflict.
Non-Argumentative	 israeli politicians ultimately decided against striking deeper within gaza amidst concerns of higher casualties on both sides and increasing international criticism.
Non-Argumentative	the war ended on january 18, when both israel and hamas called unilateral ceasefires.
Non-Argumentative	 israel completed its withdrawal on january 21.
Non-Argumentative	 throughout this period, around the world, newspapers, leaders, and experts expressed opinions for and against israel's military strikes in gaza.
Non-Argumentative	by the end of the 22-day operation, 1,400 palestinians were dead,of which were children, whileisraelis were killed, many of whom were idf soldiers.
Non-Argumentative	 multiple questions frame the debate: was the military operation necessary and justified as a means of israeli self-defence?
Non-Argumentative	 was hamas justified in using rocket attacks to get back palestinian prisoners?
Non-Argumentative	 did israel have no other choice but to launch a large-scale military assault?
Non-Argumentative	 were diplomatic or economic means available or exhausted?
Non-Argumentative	 did israel's actions dash the hopes of the israeli-palestinian peace process, or did the operation actually improve these prospects?
Non-Argumentative	 was the attack on gaza proportional to the rocket strikes?
Non-Argumentative	  is "proportionality" a fair criteria?
Non-Argumentative	 who is to blame for initiating the conflict?
Non-Argumentative	 was israel's blockade of gaza to blame?
Non-Argumentative	 or was this a just response to gaza's rocket attacks?
Non-Argumentative	 does israel have a responsibility to protect gazans because of its a-symmetry of power and resources?
Argumentative	 the military operations were a legitimate use of the israeli state 's right to defend itself and its citizens : to quote then-president-elect barack obama - `` if somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , i would do everything to stop that , and would expect israel to do the same thing . ''
Argumentative	  prior to israel 's 2008-2009 military operations , hamas had consistently violated the terms of the ceasefire between gaza and israel .
Argumentative	 it launched a total 6,300 rockets during an agreed hiatus in the confrontation , killingand wounding more than.
Argumentative	 hamas refused to extend the truce pastdecemberand subsequently resumed attacks , firing nearlymore missiles , rockets and mortars .
Argumentative	  hamas was the first to actually escalate the conflict after the ceasefire expired , with a systematic increase in rocket attacks to a magnitude of hundreds of rockets fired daily in late december .
Argumentative	  the 250,000 israelis who lived in the southern part of the country were under constant threat , often in bomb shelters , and the economy suffered as a result .
Argumentative	  israel went to great lengths to avoid its military escalation .
Argumentative	 just a few days before israel 's military operations , outgoing israeli prime minister ehud olmert made an appeal on the arab television station al-arabiya asking gaza residents to stop the firing of rockets and mortar shells so that a military response could be avoided .
Argumentative	  this appeal was apparently ignored by hamas and the other militant groups in gaza , and so israel proceeded to respond militarily to remove the capacity of gaza to launch rocket and mortar attacks -- israel was left with no other way to ensure that the inhabitants of the country 's southern regions would not have to live in fear of rocket fire .
Argumentative	 gaza was also a test case , intended to prove that israel remained a legitimate and authoritative actor in the region .
Argumentative	 much more was at stake than merely the military outcome of israel 's operation .
Argumentative	 the issue , rather , was israel 's ability to restore its deterrence power and uphold the principle that its citizens can not be targeted with impunity .
Argumentative	  israel 's military operations were a good tool to fulfill this need for self-defense and did so effectively .
Argumentative	 the israeli strikes hit their targets precisely enough to do significant damage to hamas forces , both to its leadership and to the tunnels from gaza to egypt that hamas uses to smuggle in weapons and build its growing army .
Argumentative	  doing this damage was necessary as israel could never be safe with a strong terrorist regime in control of gaza .
Argumentative	 as david harris , executive director for the american jewish committee , argued : `` israel could not tolerate a terrorist regime on its border that was launching repeated rocket and mortar attacks against israeli towns and villages . ''
Argumentative	  therefore there can be no debate that israel had the right to defend itself as well as the right to determine how best to do so .
Argumentative	 while it is easy for countries and foreigners to state their opinions about israel 's security interests and how its actions may or may not fulfill them , israel 's right to make that judgment itself must be respected .
Argumentative	 therefore israel 's military operations against gaza were justified as legitimate self defense against hamas and militant aggression which was putting the lives of israeli citizens in jeopardy .
Argumentative	 as michael oren and yossi klein haleviargue explain , `` the israeli public will not make territorial concessions on the west bank or the golan heights if gaza is allowed to become a neighboring terrorist state that can launch attacks with impunity .
Argumentative	 israel had already had a bad enough experience letting that happen with hezbollah in southern lebanon . ''
Argumentative	  without the assurance that they will be allowed to protect their homes and families following withdrawal , israelis will rightly perceive a two-state solution as an existential threat .
Argumentative	 they will continue to share the left-wing vision of coexistence with a peaceful palestinian neighbor in theory , but in reality will heed the right 's warnings of jewish powerlessness .
Argumentative	  meanwhile , the stronger hamas becomes , the more resistance moderate palestinian president mahmoud abbas will face to making any concessions to israel .
Argumentative	  therefore damaging hamas , via operation cast lead , actually aided the peace process in the long run , and was necessary in order to make an eventual two-state peace solution possible .
Argumentative	 the israeli attacks may also eventually help force hamas to accept a more durable ceasefire .
Argumentative	 unlike the botched invasion of lebanon in, when israel set itself the unattainable goal of eliminating the military capability of hezbollah , during operation cast lead it was made clear that the objective was not to wipe out hamas , but instead to force the radical group to accept a durable cease-fire on israel 's terms .
Argumentative	  this was necessary as prior to operation cast lead hamas showed no interest in peace , opting instead to pursue its political objectives through the use of terrorism .
Argumentative	 when hamas came to power in gaza in january, it failed to control the rocket fire from the variety of miltary brigades , including its own al-qassam brigade , into israel and failed to establish internal stability .
Argumentative	 the widespread violence between fatah and hamas , which ended in june, when hamas took control of gaza and ousted leaders of president mahmoud abbas 's fatah movement , made israel more wary of the security threat an unstable gaza could pose .
Argumentative	  in israel 's view , hamas ' behavior and its reliance on terror tactics will never change if it thinks it can attack with impunity , and so the israeli military operations were necessary and justified in the name of restoring israel 's deterrent and weakening hamas , both of which make long term peace more likely .
Argumentative	 operation cast lead was justified as it was proportionate to hamas ' rocket attacks against israel .
Argumentative	 it should be remembered that 250,000 israelis living in the southern part of the country had lived under years of terrorism before operation cast lead was launched , often in bomb shelters , and the economy has suffered .
Argumentative	 the world 's media may only have paid attention when israel responded to hamas ' barrage , but this does not mean that israel was not already under severe attack by this point .
Argumentative	  moreover , the israeli strikes were rightly measured to disable hamas rocket attacks .
Argumentative	  terror groups fire indiscriminately at innocent israelis and then complain of excessive or disproportionate force when israel fires back .
Argumentative	 but according to internationally accepted laws of war , israel is permitted to respond with the force necessary to end the conflict .
Argumentative	  israel was legitimate in using full force to win its war on hamas ; israel was under no obligation to restrain itself in what is , on hamas ' own terms , an existential war .
Argumentative	 provoked by hamas , israel had every right to wage a disproportionate and overwhelming response .
Argumentative	 hamas has repeatedly stated that its objective is to destroy israel .
Argumentative	 such an existential threat goes beyond simply hamas ' rocket attacks , as it portends much more destructive attacks in the future .
Argumentative	 this justifies defensive attacks from israel that go beyond responding merely to the hamas rockets , and would even justify israeli efforts to fully demobilize or destroy hamas .
Argumentative	  in spite of this , israel was actually far more restrained and proportionate than it was obligated to be .
Argumentative	 israeli precision strikes sought to minimize civilian deaths , as benjamin netanyahu argued : `` in launching precision strikes against hamas rocket launchers , headquarters , weapons depots , smuggling tunnels and training camps , israel is trying to minimize civilian casualties . ''
Argumentative	  unlike hamas , israeli strikes targeted military sites , not civilians .
Argumentative	 as gary grant argued : `` even if you target your action at military sites , civilians are inevitably going to get killed ... these need to be contrasted with the actions of hamas where every single rocket is designed to attack civilian populations , so every single act of hamas in firing these rockets is clearly an illegal act without any legal justification . ''
Argumentative	  israel may have been justified in acting disproportionately , but instead chose to respond in a proportionate and limited manner which minimized civilian deaths in gaza , and thus the israeli military operations were certainly justified .
