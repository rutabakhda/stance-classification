Non-Argumentative	while all continents suffer from their own prominent diseases, africa bears a disproportionate burden.
Non-Argumentative	 the continents holds 11% of the population, but has 25% of the world’s disease burden.
Non-Argumentative	 while hiv and malaria are well known, other common deadly diseases such as measles and pneumonia are also prominent on the continent; all of which are exacerbated by high levels of malnutrition.
Non-Argumentative	 hiv/aids alone cost the lives of around 1.2 million africans in 2012, 75% of the global deaths to the disease.
Non-Argumentative	 cheap, generic drugs have been proposed as an answer to this problemmedical drugs take one of two forms.
Non-Argumentative	 the first is a patented drug, which has been researched and developed (r&d) by a company and cannot legally be reproduced by another company for a set period of time.
Non-Argumentative	 this allows the initial company to recuperate financial losses for r&d. once the patent ends the information on how to create the drug becomes available to all drug companies.
Non-Argumentative	 they are generally produced at a lower price due to competition between firms and are called generic drugs.
Non-Argumentative	 some countries, such india and brazil, have developed a generic drug industry, with africa as a primary market.
Non-Argumentative	 some legislation in developed countries already provides high quality generic drugs to africa and there are propositions to increase the quantities.
Non-Argumentative	 there is, however, a conflict of interests between pharmaceutical companies operating for a profit and humanitarians.
Non-Argumentative	 this examines whether the mass export of high quality generic drugs to africa is a viable and effective option.
Argumentative	    generic drugs are much cheaper to produce , which is ideal for africa 's struggling population .
Argumentative	 while there has been significant gross domestic product , gdp , growth in africa , the actual distribution of wealth is relatively unequal .
Argumentative	 according to afrobarometer ,% of africans still feel that their economic condition is poor .
Argumentative	 this restricts their ability to purchase high cost drugs .
Argumentative	 generic medication would reduce the price of these drugs , making them affordable to the average citizen .
Argumentative	 the patented drug glivec , used for cancer treatment , costs # 48.62 formg in south africa while its generic equivalent , produced in india , costs # 4.82 .
Argumentative	 increased access will result in higher levels of treatment , which in turn will reduce death rates from preventable diseases in africa .
Argumentative	 the decreased cost of pharmaceuticals allows african states to focus on other aspects of medical schemes .
Argumentative	 pharmaceuticals are not the only aspect in treatment , there needs to be sufficient staff , medical equipment and infrastructure .
Argumentative	 these requirements cost money , which the savings made on pharmaceuticals provide .
Argumentative	 in europe ,% of dispensed medicines are generic yet they cost only% of pharmaceutical expenditure , with a similar model predicted for south africa .
Argumentative	 this allows the state to focus on other aspects of medical schemes .
Argumentative	 the increased availability of high quality generic drugs will reduce the numbers of bad and fake pharmaceuticals on the markets .
Argumentative	 the cost of patented drugs has forced many to search for other options .
Argumentative	 this is exploited by the billion dollar global counterfeit drug trade .
Argumentative	 fake drugs are the cause of around 100,000 deaths in africa every year .
Argumentative	 bad drugs , which are substandard , have also found their way in to africa ; one in six tuberculosis pills have been found to be of a poor quality .
Argumentative	 the widespread introduction of low cost , high quality drugs will hopefully ensure that consumers do not turn to sellers in market places .
Argumentative	 it is unrealistic to expect poorer countries , such as those in africa , to pay the same price as the developed world 's markets .
Argumentative	 current patent laws for many countries dictate that prices for buying patented drugs should be universally the same .
Argumentative	 this makes it extremely difficult for african countries to purchase pharmaceuticals set at the market price of developed countries .
Argumentative	 in the us there are nine patented drugs which cost in excess of $ 200,000 .
Argumentative	 to expect developing african states to afford this price is unfair and reinforces the exploitative relationship between the developed and developing world .
Argumentative	 generic drugs escape this problem due to their universally low prices .
