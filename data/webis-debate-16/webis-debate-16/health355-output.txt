Non-Argumentative	trans fat is the common name for unsaturated fat with trans-isomer (e-isomer) fatty acid(s).
Non-Argumentative	 it can be found in oreos, cup-cakes, french fries, deep-fried dishes, croissants, and other foods.
Non-Argumentative	 it is so unhealthy for individuals that many legislators have proposed and executed bans on the use of trans fats in restaurants, and in some cases in commercially available grocery goods and foodstuffs as well.
Non-Argumentative	new york city was the first us city to have successfully banned trans fats in december of 2006.
Non-Argumentative	 philadelphia followed in october of 2007.
Non-Argumentative	 san francisco, seattle, and chicago have all passed similar bans or limitations since.
Non-Argumentative	 many other legislatures in the us are pursuing bans.
Non-Argumentative	 denmark was the first country to effectively ban trans fats in 2003, with switzerland following in 2009.
Non-Argumentative	 the debate continues in many other countries and localities.
Non-Argumentative	while many believe that the world might be healthier without the trans-isomer fats, others contend that trans fats have a particularly delicious taste, and serve the functional purpose of extending the shelf-life of foods.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents of a ban also criticize efforts by the government to protect consumers by limiting their choices, calling this "infantilization" and "nannying."
Non-Argumentative	 but supporters respond that trans fats are so widespread in restaurants and products (often without labelling) that consumers really don't have an informed "choice" in consuming the fat.
Argumentative	 and while many argue that banning trans fats is like trying to ban tobacco or alcohol, supporters respond that trans fats are only an ingredient (not a whole product category) for which there are replacement ingredients that can maintain the taste and quality of the final food products.
Argumentative	trans fats , which are chemically engineered , decrease levels of desirable cholesterol while increasing harmful cholesterol ; they increase dangerous inflammation that can contribute to the onset of diabetes ; and they harden artery walls , which increases blood pressure .
Argumentative	 trans fats are much worse than even naturally occurring , and still very unhealthy , saturated fats such as those found in butter .
Argumentative	 dariush mozaffarian , a harvard cardiologist and epidemiologist , calculated that up topercent of heart attacks in the united states are the result of trans fat consumption .
Argumentative	  banning trans fats would therefore mean saving thousands of lives and improving the general health of hundreds of thousands of individuals .
Argumentative	 in england , for example , aper cent reduction in the use of trans fats , as a proportion of total daily calories , would prevent an estimated 11,000 heart attacks saving 7,000 lives a year .
Argumentative	  consumption of trans fats in developed nations ranges from 2-4 per cent of total calorie intake , so it is a huge factor in many countries .
Argumentative	  in new york , voluntary efforts to reduce their use by restaurants and retailers failed , however theban caused reasturants to stop using trans fats with the proportion of new york restaurants using them falling fromper cent to less thanper cent .
Argumentative	  there were fears that trans fats would be replaced with saturated animal fat , but this has not been the case .
Argumentative	 writing in the british medical journal , dariush mozaffarian , assistant professor of medicine , and meir stampfer , professor of epidemiology at harvard , say removing industrial trans fats is ` one of the most straightforward public health strategies for rapid improvements in health . '
Argumentative	 a ban would save lives , be easy to implement yet have no impact on the price , sales , taste or availability of the affected foods .
Argumentative	  moreover , no amount of trans fats is healthy , unlike other fats .
Argumentative	 as catherine winters argues , `` while we know what a healthy level of saturated fat is ,percent or less of your daily calories , no one knows what a healthy level would be for trans fatty acids . ''
Argumentative	  `` eating foods that contain trans fatty acids is like riding in a car without using a seat belt , '' says michael f. jacobson , phd , executive director of the center for science in the public interest , cspi , a washington , d.c.-based consumer advocacy organization concerned with health and nutrition issues .
Argumentative	  a study published by the american journal of clinical nutrition also suggests that trans fats may increase a woman 's risk of fertility problems bypercent .
Argumentative	 women who receivedpercent of their daily calories from trans fats , weretopercent more likely to suffer infertility due to lack of ovulation .
Argumentative	 for someone with a 2,000 calorie diet , this level of intake could be achieved by consuming justgrams of trans fats a day , an amount that could be found in a single doughnut or portion of french fries .
Argumentative	 ` it 's really a small amount of fats that we observed having a significant effect on infertility , ' said lead researcher dr. jorge chavarro . ''
Argumentative	  by contrast to natural fats , trans fats are entirely synthetic , and pose a significantly greater risk to individuals ' long term health than natural saturated fats .
Argumentative	 for this reason , it is reasonable to consider banning them .
Argumentative	  bans should be reserved for very serious health crises .
Argumentative	 the infertility , obesity , heart attacks , and death caused by the presence of trans fats in diets is such a crisis .
Argumentative	 a ban is , thus , an appropriate regulatory response .
Argumentative	 one of the purposes of government is identify possible threats to health and protect the people from these threats .
Argumentative	 the fact that some government regulations seem ` silly ' or misplaced , or can not easily be understood by lay-people is not a compelling argument for having no regulations at all , or for not having regulations in the case of trans fat .
Argumentative	 the commentators who denounce the ` nanny state ' do not indicate what , if any , regulations or styles of regulation they approve of .
Argumentative	 do they think there should be no inspections of restaurants by health inspectors ?
Argumentative	 no regulation at all of food or drug safety by the food and drug administration ?
Argumentative	 some commentators think that people should be encouraged to study the dangers of trans fats and make their own judgements about what to eat .
Argumentative	 but people have limited time to do research on such matters .
Argumentative	 it makes sense to delegate the research to a central authority , so that instead ofmillion people trying to learn about trans fats and every other lurking menace , a handful of experts can make recommendations based on the likely responses and desires of the average , informed citizen .
Argumentative	 non-specialists ' capacity to absorb information on complex chemical and biological subjects is quite limited .
Argumentative	 the majority of us are reliant on the research of others for most of what we know .
Argumentative	  the opinion of the experts on the dangers of trans fats is conclusive : trans fats are unsafe .
Argumentative	 the american food and drug administration , fda , considers all uses of trans fats to be ` generally regarded as safe . '
Argumentative	 this allows the use of trans fats in whatever way food producers desire .
Argumentative	 's afe ' for the fda means ' a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under its intended conditions of use ' , which no longer applies to trans fats .
Argumentative	 this ` generally regarded as safe ' status should be revoked which in turn would greatly restrict its use in food .
Argumentative	 the other option would be to allow local jurisdictions to regulate trans fats , but this would be more costly and lead to a patchwork of regulations .
Argumentative	  the most effective method of controlling the use of trans-fats is through centralised , nationally applicable policy making .
Argumentative	 the poor and young are particularly vulnerable to the negative health effects of trans fats ; at the very least , the threat posed to these groups justifies the use of informed regulation .
Argumentative	 professor alan maryon-davis , president of the uk faculty of public health said in: `` there are great differences in the amount of trans-fats consumed by different people and we are particularly concerned about young people and those with little disposable income who eat a lot of this type of food .
Argumentative	 this is a major health inequalities issue . ''
Argumentative	  the government has a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from harms that they are not best placed to understand or avoid themselves , and so a ban on trans fats would not only save lives but would also be legitimate under the government 's role to protect when citizens can not reasonably protect themselves .
Argumentative	 it is easy and inexpensive to replace trans fats with other , less harmful products without significantly altering the taste of the food .
Argumentative	 kraft eliminated trans fats from its oreo cookies , with little public perception of any change in taste .
Argumentative	  similarly , the wendy 's restaurant chain tested a new frying oil infranchises , with customers not noticing a difference in taste .
Argumentative	 denmark imposed a national ban on trans fats with which even mcdonald 's has complied .
Argumentative	  replacements for trans fats will get cheaper and cheaper with time , as they are used more frequently and as the companies that produce and distribute them increase their sales volumes and are able to sell them for lower prices .
Argumentative	 since trans fats are not irreplaceable , objections for the sake of consumer freedom are also unconvincing .
Argumentative	 as with lead added to paint , trans fats are unnecessary additions to products that can cause significant harm .
Argumentative	 most people remain ignorant of the presence of trans-fats in their food , and of their effects .
Argumentative	 in this area the ban on trans fats differs from restrictions placed on the sale of alcohol and tobacco and so the two kinds of bans are not comparable .
Argumentative	 not only are trans fats easy to substitute in foodstuffs , without impairing quality or taste , the presence of trans-fats is hard to detect .
Argumentative	 it is all-but impossible for informed and conscientious consumers to avoid buying and eating trans-fats .
Argumentative	 while banning cigarettes and alcohol mean banning an entire product category , banning the ingredient of trans fats means no such thing .
Argumentative	 rather , it simply means that readily available replacement ingredients must be used in the preparation of the same foods .
Argumentative	 and , since these fatty replacements are widespread and cheaply available , food makers and consumers should have little difficulty making the adjustment to making and consuming the same , albeit slightly modified , foods .
