Non-Argumentative	the geneva conventions ofcollectively form a core part of international humanitarian law, a series of conventions and protocols that regulate armed conflict.
Non-Argumentative	 the geneva conventions specifically detail a number of protections which states must extend to enemy combatants from the opposing country captured during times of war.
Non-Argumentative	 these include prohibitions against all forms of violence including torture, humiliating and degrading treatment, and the passing of sentence without a properly constituted court hearing.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition, medical treatment must be provided to those who need it and prisoners must be allowed to send and receive letters, enabling continued contact with their families.
Non-Argumentative	 however, these protections only apply to soldiers of recognised armies.
Non-Argumentative	 the global “war on terror” has pitted america and its allies against al-qaeda, the taliban, and other non-state groups adopting irregular warfare strategies.
Non-Argumentative	 when captured, their members (or suspected members) wear uniform and represent no sovereign state, posing problems for those holding them.
Non-Argumentative	 the controversial treatment of terror suspects when captured by the west in other parts of the world has been repeatedly highlighted by international media organisations and human rights groups.
Non-Argumentative	 guantanamo bay is a particularly disturbing example, but it is undoubtedly reflective of the way that terrorists are treated in other, less visible parts of the world.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents of subjecting terrorists to the geneva conventions argue that ostensible changes in warfare must give way to the greater need to maintain the regulations on warfare that have restricted its barbarity over the past half-century.
Argumentative	 opponents maintain that this is neither desirable nor achievable, and that new methods are required to combat the new threat.
Argumentative	terrorists are engaged in a war like any other : they unite as a political actor to undertake military action in favour of a specific cause .
Argumentative	 the fact that they do not represent one individual nation and that they are not at war with a specific list of states does not undermine this : al qaeda , for example , has clear goals including eliminating american influence within muslim nations , destroying israel and re-establishing the caliphate , blanchard  .
Argumentative	 the fact that we may not view these causes as worthy or legitimate is irrelevant : we do not assess the merits or legitimacy of a conflict between states before deciding whether to apply the geneva convention .
Argumentative	 it should therefore apply equally to soldiers and terrorists .
Argumentative	 the geneva conventions were formed to ensure that future wars would not result in the barbarity and wanton violence that mired world war ii ; to deny it to terrorists would risk the undermining of norms that have developed to restrain warfare .
Argumentative	 if we do n't treat terrorists as prisoners of war therefore , we risk a return to the barbarity of warfare in the first half of the 20th century .
Argumentative	 even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity .
Argumentative	 there are certain acts , such as torture , to which no individual should be subjected , regardless of their own behaviour .
Argumentative	 the geneva convention is about universal respect for human dignity , international committee of the red cross  , not merely for those who show it in return .
Argumentative	 civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner , regardless of the barbarity of their adversaries .
Argumentative	 only by acting in such a manner can states prove the superiority of their own humanity .
Argumentative	 poor treatment affirms terrorist ideology : regardless of what is morally right , it would be beneficial to treat terrorists in the ways prescribed by the convention .
Argumentative	 terrorist ideology is often predicated on the behaviour of those countries against which it is targeted .
Argumentative	 treating captured terrorists or terror suspects in a way that ignores their human dignity only reinforces negative perceptions of the west and encourages the radicalization of the youth , mccarthy  .
Argumentative	 in addition , such behaviour can be used to justify terrorist actions to less radicalised members of certain communities .
Argumentative	 harsh interrogation of captives has not been shown to be effective , white  .
Argumentative	 those who are prepared to die to advance their cause are unlikely to yield information , no matter how much they are threatened or tortured .
Argumentative	 where captives do provide information , they often state simply what they think that the interrogators want to hear , rather than anything that is true , mazzetti  .
Argumentative	 in addition , given the cellular nature of many terrorist organisations , those captured often have very little useful information to begin with .
Argumentative	 even if they have been involved in a plot , they may only have information about a very small part of that plot .
Argumentative	 furthermore , winning the trust of prisoners can lead to more effective information than the use of torture .
Argumentative	 the united nations , as the institution that formed and maintains the geneva conventions and other restrictions on warfare , is able to use its structures to punish states that do not adhere to its protocols .
Argumentative	 the international criminal court , established by the rome statute of, is able to prosecute those specific persons who are charged with war crimes .
Argumentative	 such defendants , if convicted , can be ordered to pay the victims .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the international court of justice is able to bring cases against specific states that are clearly identified as having broken the protocols of war .
Argumentative	 as such , the united nations is both legally and institutionally capable of ensuring that the dictates of the geneva conventions are upheld , specifically the right of a combatant captured in a conflict zone to be granted prisoner of war status .
Argumentative	 while this would provide a degree of protection for captured terrorists , it also means that terrorist organizations are subject to standards of conduct in war .
Argumentative	 making them subject to the geneva conventions would uphold an incentive of restraint which might sometimes influence their conduct .
