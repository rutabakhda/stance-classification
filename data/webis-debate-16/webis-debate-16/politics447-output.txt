Non-Argumentative	golden dawn is a right-wing extremist political party that has rapidly gained prominence in the midst of the economic depression greece finds itself in.
Non-Argumentative	 having been founded inby nikolaos michaloliakos, golden dawn’s recent success in the juneelections gained them 7% of the national vote translating intoseats in the greek parliament.
Non-Argumentative	[1] the elections resulted in a coalition government headed by antonis samaras which includes the parties new democracy, pasok and democratic left.
Non-Argumentative	 golden dawn’s success has come in the wake of austerity-induced economic depression with unemployment soaring to over 20% and youth unemployment to 36%.
Non-Argumentative	 aside from its economic woes, greece also faces problems of a huge influx of illegal immigrants and political refugees / asylum seekers and currently has the largest number of illegal immigrants percitizens, in europe.
Non-Argumentative	 [2]golden dawn hold hard-line right-wing political views and call for a strong state seeking to safeguard core traditional greek values and culture.
Non-Argumentative	 [3] as such, they have a strong anti-immigration and white supremacist agenda.
Non-Argumentative	 although golden dawn themselves deny it, the party is generally seen as neo-nazi in character having commonly been reported to use original german nazi slogans translated into greek and nazi-like salutes.
Non-Argumentative	 [4] golden dawn supporters have widely been reported to have carried out racist acts of violence across greece, primarily targeting illegal immigrants.
Non-Argumentative	 the party’s voter base is largely consistent of ‘small proprietors, unemployed, members of the security forces, plus the criminal underworld’.
Non-Argumentative	 [5] as golden dawn’s popularity seems to be on the rise, with the party ranking third in recent opinion polls with 10.5% [6] and racist acts of violence are on the increase, this debate looks at fundamental questions about the role of the state in balancing democratic liberties, rights of political participation and freedom of speech, with the rights of minority groups to live safe from fear, violence and racial hatred.
Argumentative	[5] ibidgolden dawn 's heavily racist agenda has led to a huge increase in the amount of violent crimes committed against immigrants and refugees , many of whom from conflict torn areas like afghanistan , syria and iraq .
Argumentative	 gangs of golden dawn members , usually clad in golden dawn black t-shirts and balaclavas to hide their identity have been widely reported to attack immigrants , many of whom are homeless , at random , causing severe and often life threatening injuries upon their victims .
Argumentative	  in the six months to septemberthere have beensuch attacks .
Argumentative	  the situation has escalated to the extent that the united nations high commissioner for human rights navi pillay has expressed explicit concerns about human rights violations committed in greece .
Argumentative	  this behaviour is totally unacceptable from any individual or organisation and especially for a political party .
Argumentative	 through their hateful messages and nazi inspired ideology and chants like `` blood , honour , golden dawn ''  , golden dawn are directly inciting hatred and violence amongst their supporters .
Argumentative	 not only this , but their own party members , wearing party uniform and representing golden dawn are the ones often causing such violence .
Argumentative	 the state has an imperative to protect society from such heinous acts .
Argumentative	 it is unacceptable to have people living in fear of their own lives , whether they are greek citizens or not and irrespective of whether they are legal or illegal immigrants .
Argumentative	 all people have a basic human right to be able to live free of fear from racial persecution , and the greek state is failing to safeguard those rights within its own borders .
Argumentative	 fear of marginalisation and persecution are the worst kind of oppression because it attacks their very identity and prevents them from feeling and living as free members of society .
Argumentative	 golden dawn , their beliefs and their actions must be categorically condemned , and there is no better way to do it than by banning them as a political party .
Argumentative	 they must be expelled immediately from parliament and elections must be held again , from which golden dawn will be banned from entering .
Argumentative	 in ideological terms , golden dawn call for systemic change on a huge scale , claiming the current structure of the greek political system is riddled with traitors and foreign interests .
Argumentative	  history , for example right wing regimes all over europe in the 1930s , has shown us that when right-wing extremists have gained a foothold in government , they have tried their utmost to destroy the very system from within and wipe out democracy .
Argumentative	 given golden dawn 's claims for the need to purge the country of traitors , it is not at all unthinkable that greece could go down a similar root should the party see its popularity increase even more .
Argumentative	 although it is true that people should be allowed to elect any government they want , a democracy can not be allowed to self-destruct .
Argumentative	 this is a choice the electorate can not be allowed to make for two reasons .
Argumentative	 firstly , because a choice to live under a totalitarian regime is an irrevocable choice : there is no mechanism , other than violent revolution , to oust such a regime if things do not turn out as the electorate originally expected .
Argumentative	 secondly , even if the voters are content with their decision , they can not be permitted to make such a decision on behalf of future generations who have not had a chance to vote yet .
Argumentative	 future would-be electorates would be unable to oust a totalitarian regime they did not choose for themselves .
Argumentative	 peoples ' right to exercise their basic democratic right must be protected , and in order to protect it , we must to an extent limit that very same right and deny them the possibility of voting for golden dawn .
Argumentative	 golden dawn does not behave as most political parties and their mps do not behave like politicians .
Argumentative	 this is because they are not what we would describe as politicians : they are thugs .
Argumentative	 emboldened by their mp 's privilege of immunity from prosecution golden dawn mp 's have on multiple occasions been involved in public acts of violence .
Argumentative	 mp dimitris koukoutsis is being investigated for an assault in parliament on syriza , leftist , mp vasiliki katrivanou  , while party spokesman ilias kasidiaris assaulted two other mp 's on a chat show broadcasted live on tv  .
Argumentative	 worse still , many of golden dawn 's mp 's and members face criminal charges , including ilias kasidiaris who is accused of ` accessory to robbery , bodily harm and illegal gun possession '  , although his trial has been postponed on multiple occasions because of his mp 's privileges .
Argumentative	 not only does golden dawn dislike democratic values , they actively abuse their mp 's privileges and behave unacceptably in a highly public manner towards fellow members of parliament .
Argumentative	 party leader and mp nikos mihaloliakos has publicly declared that golden dawn feel uncomfortable and disgusted in parliament and called upon party members to rally behind them and violently take the struggle out of parliament and onto the streets of athens .
Argumentative	  we can not allow such open criminality and violence to exist in politics and inside the greek parliament .
Argumentative	 they totally lack respect for other politicians and do not participate in an orderly manner expected of members of parliament and many of them have committed acts of criminality before even being elected into parliament .
Argumentative	 these people are not fit to take part in government and provide a horrific example for society .
Argumentative	 they make a mockery of the political system and disgrace greek politics and greece as a whole .
Argumentative	 they must be banned .
Argumentative	  ibid by allowing golden dawn into parliament , golden dawn gain legitimacy in two ways .
Argumentative	 firstly their very presence in parliament lends an air of legitimacy to their cause .
Argumentative	 we have established that golden dawn 's message is harmful both to democracy and to minority group rights .
Argumentative	 they have managed to use their newfound media exposure and greater state funding for their public relations department , to great effect .
Argumentative	  however , even though there has been a social and media response against golden dawn and racist acts of violence , increased publicity , both positive and negative , is having the effect of normalising society 's view of the party .
Argumentative	 as the political presence of golden dawn settles into society 's conscience , members and mp 's are often portrayed as normal people and the acts of violence committed under their name are ignored  .
Argumentative	 the normalisation of golden dawn 's presence in democratic political discourse increases the likelihood that people will see their claims and methods as legitimate .
Argumentative	 as the electorate despairs and becomes increasingly disillusioned with the mainstream parties of pasok and new democracy , the danger is that golden dawn 's increasingly normalised presence will soak up many votes from people who are not necessarily racist or strongly right-wing .
Argumentative	 their provision of food-aid to unemployed and desperate greeks hit hard by the economic crisis has gained them further publicity and popularity in a similar way to extremist parties in the middle east -- even if it is very small they are seen to be doing something so rewarded for it .
Argumentative	 an end must be put to golden dawn 's surge in popularity .
Argumentative	 golden dawn must be seen for who they are and the only way to achieve this is by banning them .
Argumentative	 once removed from the public eye and the media ceases to portray them as a legitimate party , golden dawn will no longer be able to attract support in the ways we have seen .
