Non-Argumentative	current drugs policy in many western countries is loosely based on the principle that drugs are criminalised in proportion to their harmfulness.
Non-Argumentative	 typically, whilst alcohol and nicotine are legal, a wide variety of other stimulants and narcotics (for example, heroin, cocaine, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines) are deemed illegal.
Non-Argumentative	 usually the penalty attached to possession of these drugs varies according to their perceived harmfulness; for example, a “hard” drug like heroin attracts harsher punishment than a “soft” drug like cannabis.
Non-Argumentative	 supplying others with a drug also usually attracts a harsher penalty than possessing a small amount for purely personal use.
Non-Argumentative	 some countries, such as the uk, attempt to codify harmfulness by operating a grading system for illegal drugs (‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’); in others, assumptions about harmfulness are expressed through policing and sentencing policy.
Non-Argumentative	across the world, approaches to drugs vary, from liberal policies in the netherlands where many “soft” drugs are in effect tolerated, to the harsh policies of singapore, which hands out the death penalty for certain drug-related crimes.
Non-Argumentative	 however, “hard” drugs such as heroin and cocaine are pretty much universally illegal.
Non-Argumentative	 in debating this topic, the proposition needs to be clear about the implications of their case; typically they need to argue for the legalisation of “hard” drugs as well as “soft” ones.
Non-Argumentative	 they may also wish to present some kind of model or plan whereby the quality and marketing of drugs is regulated (for example, in ways similar to controls on tobacco and alcohol in many countries).
Argumentative	 individuals are sovereign over their own bodies , and should be free to make choices which affect them and not other individuals .
Argumentative	 since the pleasure gained from drugs and the extent to which this weighs against potential risks is fundamentally subjective , it is not up to the state to legislate in this area .
Argumentative	 rather than pouring wasted resources into attempting to suppress drug use , the state would be better off running information campaigns to educate people about the risks and consequences of taking different types of drugs .
Argumentative	 those who want to use drugs will take them whether they are legal or not -- and more are doing so than ever before .
Argumentative	 inthere was something like 1,000 problematic drug users in the uk , now there are over 250,000 .
Argumentative	 legalization will also remove the glamour which surrounds an underground activity and so make drug use less attractive to impressionable teenagers .
Argumentative	 for example , statistics suggest that cannabis use in the uk declined after its classification was lowered from ` b ' to ` c ' .
Argumentative	 currently in the uk , purity of illegal amphetamine is normally under% , and some tablets sold as ecstasy contain no mdma at all .
Argumentative	 instead , drugs are adulterated , `` cut '' , with substances from chalk and talcum powder to completely different drugs .
Argumentative	 at least when drugs are legalised the state can regulate their sale to make sure that they are clean and not cut with other dangerous substances .
Argumentative	 this will minimise the risk to users .
Argumentative	 the illegality of drugs fuels a huge amount of crime that could be eliminated if drugs were legalised .
Argumentative	 price controls would mean that addicts would no longer have to steal to fund their habits , and a state-provided drug services would put dealers out of business , starving criminal gangs of their main source of funding .
Argumentative	 for example , an italian mafia family were making around $ 44bn a year from cocaine smuggling .
Argumentative	 this represents something like% of italy 's entire gdp -- and that from only one crime syndicate .
Argumentative	 the taliban gets most of its revenue from poppies , which provide the opium for heroin .
Argumentative	 they do this by intimidating local farmers who would otherwise sell their harvest at market .
Argumentative	 they then demand `` protection money '' as well , or else either another local warlord or the ` protectors ' themselves would rob the farmer .
Argumentative	 something like 22,700 people have died in mexico since januaryfrom gangsters who want to protect their revenue and almost the entire continent of south america , from brazil to colombia , has had their governments destabilised by drug lords .
Argumentative	 the hugely-costly but unsuccessful war on drugs could be ended , starving terrorists of the profits of drug production .
Argumentative	 as a result peace and development could be brought to unstable drug-producing states such as colombia and afghanistan .
Argumentative	 in most countries where drugs are illegal , tobacco and alcohol , which arguably have equally devastating consequences in society , are legal .
Argumentative	 in a uk study , alcohol was shown to have the worst effects of any drug , yet the current law recognises that people should be able to choose whether they drink or not .
Argumentative	 the same should be true of drugs .
Argumentative	 in 2009-2010 , the tax revenue from tobacco in the uk was # 10.5 billion .
Argumentative	 if the state legalizes drugs , it can tax them and use the revenue from this practise to fund treatment .
Argumentative	 at the moment such treatment is difficult to justify as it appears to be spending ordinary taxpayers ' money on junkies .
