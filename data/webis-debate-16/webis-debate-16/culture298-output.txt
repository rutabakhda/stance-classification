Non-Argumentative	multiculturalism is a somewhat nebulous term, and as such can be used to mean a variety of things.
Non-Argumentative	 this, however, will concern itself with multiculturalism as meaning the preservation of a culture distinct from that of the majority of the population.
Non-Argumentative	 that is, choosing to exist within a community with similar values, and making deliberate decisions to identify yourself with that community in ways that visibly set yourself apart from others in your country.
Non-Argumentative	in uk politics, bradford in the 1980s is often taken as an example of multiculturalism in action.
Non-Argumentative	 a number of communities, in effect, lived side by side: the pre-existing white community, and the newly formed immigrant communities, who largely separated themselves by country and region.
Non-Argumentative	 picked out for special attention by the press and by later events, the pakistani community was often held up as an example of one that rejected integration.
Non-Argumentative	 often new immigrants (particularly women) had poor english skills, and thus a great dependency of other immigrants for a sense of community.
Non-Argumentative	 parts of bradford became known as "bradistan" because of the prevalence of immigrants, and the various businesses set up in the area by immigrants, for immigrants (for example, shops selling products needed to produce traditionally pakistani food).
Argumentative	supporting multiculturalism, in the context of a debate, can mean anything from thinking that, in principle, it is better than integration, to supporting a range of policies that would enable a multicultural rather than integrated society to function (like funding for specific cultural projects, or religious schools).
Argumentative	cultural heritage is often very important to people , particularly to new immigrants who are already feeling the loss of their old ways of life .
Argumentative	 it is a matter of luck whether we are born in a country with lots of opportunities , or are forced to travel if we wish to seek a better life .
Argumentative	 as such , we should not penalise such unfortunate people but rather allow them to continue to practice important cultural practices .
Argumentative	 britain has introduced support for a number of non-christian faith schools that both respect and encourage the faiths and cultures of its students , many of whom are first or second-generation immigrants .1 assimilation expects immigrants to shed their cultural heritage it is expected that recent immigrants to a country will shed major parts of their cultures and values to adapt to those of the host country .
Argumentative	 but , this is unrealistic .
Argumentative	 nobody will quickly shed and adopt the new cultural elements of a nation ; a major flaw of the assimilation model .
Argumentative	 for example , america , often used as the prime example of assimilation , is not the melting pot once thought .
Argumentative	 america is a land of many cultures , where important and sustained cultural divisions between americans persist .
Argumentative	 assimilationist doctrine claims it is working towards a sense of one american-ness , but there are two problems with this notion .
Argumentative	 one , america is a land built on democratic difference -- very different political groups can and do exist .
Argumentative	 two , american assimilation has had a troubling history consisting of a dominating , white power structure aiming to restrict extending american citizen to all citizens , and denying human rights to all citizens , often because of race or skin colour .
Argumentative	 allowing people to preserve their own cultures allows other people to understand different cultural practices and ways of living life .
Argumentative	 this exposure to new experiences enriches the cultural practices of all : we are better able to make choices about the way in which we wish to live our lives , whether that is a matter of what food we eat or what religion we practice .
Argumentative	 the amish community in rural america is just one example ; ` it is not necessary to live an amish life to appreciate what they can teach us ' , the mere knowledge that one can be happy without constant access to life 's modern technologies is a humbling thought .1 neither the state nor the majority or host community has a monopoly on the knowledge of the best way to live life .
Argumentative	 as such , we each have to seek out this `` good life '' for ourselves ; it varies depending on our individual values and priorities .
Argumentative	 multiculturalism allows that there is a greater choice between ways of living , rather than everyone being `` integrated '' into a way of life that varies very little .
Argumentative	 even if some ways of life are actively harmful , the law exists to protect us against such excesses .
Argumentative	 in the united states for example , polygamy is illegal in allstates despite states like utah and colorado having large populations of mormons that believe in the practice1 .
Argumentative	 mormon culture is nevertheless still pervasive in these areas .
Argumentative	 this acts as proof that the state is able to draw a line between what is right and wrong without infringing upon the ideals of a multi-cultural society .
