Non-Argumentative	on the 27th februarysoldiers seized the crimean parliament.
Non-Argumentative	 they did not have insignia but raised a russian flag above the building.
Non-Argumentative	 the crimean parliament then voted to dissolve the regional government and elected a new pro-russian leader sergey aksyonov.
Non-Argumentative	 he promptly requested that russia provide help to ensure “peace and calm” within the crimea.
Non-Argumentative	following the ousting in a revolution of pro-russian ukrainian president yanukovych and the loss of influence this represented russia has been happy to oblige.
Non-Argumentative	 russia already was engaged in a show of force with military exercises along ukraine’s borders.
Non-Argumentative	 it also already had troops at its black sea fleet base in crimea.
Non-Argumentative	 unmarked troops and helicopters, though believed to be russian, occupied sevastopol and other crimean airports taking over the transport infrastructure.
Non-Argumentative	 in order to prevent a response from ukraine russian troops surrounded ukrainian bases and demanded they surrender.
Non-Argumentative	 ukraine’s verbal response was tough with the prime minister arseny yatseniuk saying “this is not a threat: this is actually the declaration of war to my country”.
Non-Argumentative	 ukraine therefore clearly believes that russia had no right to send forces into crimea, a sovereign part of the country.
Non-Argumentative	 however ukraine has agreed with the calls for restraint, it has mobilised its army but has made no move to engage the russians and has refrained from allowing its troops to use force in crimea leading to tense but peaceful standoffs.
Non-Argumentative	 the endgame is integration of crimea into russia.
Non-Argumentative	 a referendum on the 16th march showed that 97% of voters in the crimea want to join the russian federation.
Non-Argumentative	 the final result is therefore that crimea is lost to the ukraine, but there being a result does not necessarily mean russia’s actions were just and moral.
Non-Argumentative	crimea itself is a peninsula out from the south of ukraine into the black sea.
Non-Argumentative	 crimea is strategic in large part because of the good harbours it has, something that russia otherwise lacks.
Non-Argumentative	 it was historically russian having been taken from the crimean khanate in 1783.
Non-Argumentative	 historically in russia it is notable for being the sight of heroic military action; the crimean war against french and british invasion in 1854-5, and a nine month siege of sevastopol by the wehrmacht.
Non-Argumentative	 a century after the crimean war inkhrushchev handed over the crimea to ukraine, the reasons are disputed, but as both were a part of the ussr it may well have simply been for convenience as there is a land bridge from ukraine but not to russia.
Non-Argumentative	history and geography are not the only causes of tensions; it is culturally and ethnically more russian than ukrainian too.
Non-Argumentative	 crimea has an ethnic russian majority with 60% of the population being russians.
Non-Argumentative	 10-12% of the population is crimean tartars and firmly opposed to russia as a result of having been deported by stalin.
Non-Argumentative	 the balance is mostly ukrainian.
Non-Argumentative	 the language is russian and as a result most people get their news from russia.
Non-Argumentative	russia has clear interests in crimea and has basing rights for up to 25,000 troops in sevastopol which is the main base for the black sea fleet.
Non-Argumentative	 these forces in sevastopol both ensure that russia is particularly concerned about the security of the peninsular and that it has the means to make its views felt.
Non-Argumentative	 it cannot be surprising then that russia, feeling its citizens and interests threatened in the province, acted using these forces that were to hand in crimea.
Argumentative	 president yanukovych is ukraine 's legitimate president .
Argumentative	 he is therefore perfectly at liberty to allow russian troops into his country to keep the peace in much the same way as countries around the world welcome us troops on their soil as protection from external threats or un peacekeepers to keep the peace domestically .
Argumentative	 yanukovych in a letter to putin called `` on the president of russia , mr. putin , asking him to use the armed forces of the russian federation to establish legitimacy , peace , law and order , stability and defending the people of ukraine . ''
Argumentative	 the current government in ukraine is the result of an illegal coup .
Argumentative	 on the 21st february yanukovych and the opposition in ukraine agreed to eu proposals that restored theukrainian constitution and set presidential elections for later in.
Argumentative	 the two sides were `` to create a coalition and form a national unity government '' .
Argumentative	 thus yanukovych was to remain president until the next elections .
Argumentative	 the opposition however ignored this deal .
Argumentative	 as putin puts it `` they immediately seized his residence rather than giving him a chance to fulfil the agreement ... he did n't have any chance of being reelected . ''
Argumentative	 the ukrainian opposition used illegal and unconstitutional means to effect regime change .
Argumentative	 russia therefore has a right to act to protect those who there has been an `` armed seizure of power '' .
Argumentative	 russia has a strong claim to the crimea ; the territory was only handed over inby nikita krushchev for political reasons .
Argumentative	 previously it had been russian for three hundred years .
Argumentative	 historically crimea is russian not ukrainian .
Argumentative	 culturally crimea is important to russia too , it was the main russian tourism destination during the soviet union and symbolised russia 's gains in the 18th and 19th centuries .
Argumentative	 russia for most of the 1990s refused to accept ukraine 's independence , let alone crimea that crimea should be a part of it with the russian parliament engaging in actions such as declaring sevastopol a russian city .
Argumentative	 therefore the sovereignty of the region should be considered to be contested .
Argumentative	 it is the people of crimea who are important and their interests should be considered .
Argumentative	 putin told the federation council that russia is responding to a `` threat to the lives of citizens of the russian federation ... and the personnel of the armed forces of the russian federation on ukrainian territory '' .
Argumentative	 russia needs to protect both the russian citizens who are in crimea and the ethnic russians who look to moscow not kiev .
Argumentative	 the crimean parliament has agreed to hold a referendum on 25th may on `` autonomous republic of crimea has state sovereignty and is a part of ukraine , in accordance with treaties and agreements . ''
Argumentative	 this was put forward to 16th march with two options ; do you support crimea 's reunification with russia ?
Argumentative	 do you support the restoration of the constitution of the crimean republic datedand crimea 's status as a part of ukraine ?
Argumentative	 the% vote for joining russia and% turnout conclusively show that this is the will of the crimean people .
Argumentative	 the russian parliament has agreed to approve force `` in connection with the extraordinary situation in ukraine , the threat to the lives of citizens of the russian federation , our compatriots '' the russian federal council approved the move unanimously so allowing russian troops to be used .
Argumentative	 this gives president putting the authority to use the russian military in crimea , or elsewhere in the ukraine , if he believes it is necessary .
Argumentative	 the crimean parliament has also asked to join russia and is to have a referendum to show the support of the people for this action .
Argumentative	 `` from today , as crimea is part of the russian federation the only legal forces here are troops of the russian federation , and any troops of the third country will be considered to be armed groups with all the associated consequences . ''
Argumentative	 this clearly gives russian troops the right to be in crimea .
