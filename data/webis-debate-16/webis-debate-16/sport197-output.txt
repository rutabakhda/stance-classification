Non-Argumentative	pierre de coubertin, the founder of the modern olympic movement, developed in the early 20th century a set of universal principles – or values – that, he intended, encompassed all olympic games: respect, excellence and friendship (london 2012).
Non-Argumentative	 his principles were born out of the international olympic committees motto of ‘citius, altius, fortius’ – faster, higher, stronger (allen, 2011).
Non-Argumentative	 the values were intended to apply to all competing athletes but eventually permeate into society and education.
Non-Argumentative	fast forward toin atlanta, an olympics marred by the growth of corporate sponsorship, a bombing that gave the event a political edge and a widespread belief that, even if they were not caught, doping was rife among athletes.
Non-Argumentative	 each of the following olympics has followed a similar path, away from the ideals of de coubertin and the values that have ensured the longevity of the event.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents argue drugs now overshadow remarkable performances, the voting process is accused of bribery and pandering to the interests of its most senior officials whilst studies indicate the youth are more uninspired by the event than ever before.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents of the motion maintain however that ultimately sport wins out, that the olympic dream is forever maintained by the application and dedication of its athletes; countries and athletes continue to flock to the event because of what it represents and that history will not be overshadowed by political posturing or drug scandals.
Non-Argumentative	 though the olympic games will continue to be the world’s premier sporting event, the debate concerns whether the modern olympics still carries the dream and ideals of its antecedents?
Argumentative	 the massive commercialisation of the games erodes the idea of taking part for its own sake : with so much sponsorship money at stake , winning at all costs is the inevitable aim .
Argumentative	 the rule of the sponsors seems more important than the sport : interrupting television coverage of the events to advertise is symptomatic of this , permitting mcdonalds to sponsor a sports event is another .
Argumentative	 as is the auctioning off of ` virtually every aspect of the games to the highest bidder . '
Argumentative	 1 whilst a recent report indicates that sport is still at the centre of the olympics , ` the volume of commercial messages drowns out any competing narratives apart from sports ' , multinational monitor  p..
Argumentative	 the olympic dream is that competing narrative attempting to weave the values of friendship , respect and excellence into the home viewer .
Argumentative	 furthermore , corporate sponsorship concentrates on the richest countries ' athletes .
Argumentative	 the united states , for example , benefits from huge funding from overcorporations for its team and can thus train them to far higher levels than developing countries can , multinational monitor  .
Argumentative	 as one of these 100-plus companies , citi paid $million purely to be the ` official bank of theunited states olympic team ' , belson  .
Argumentative	 this prevents competition on an equal footing , one feature of the olympic dream .
Argumentative	 the use of performance-enhancing drugs is sufficiently common in the olympics to be a cause of concern .
Argumentative	 not only do they reduce the victories of those who take them to meaninglessness but they cast aspersions over the efforts of all other athletes .
Argumentative	 as simon barnes noted in beijing in, `` the world is full of people declaring that they do n't care who wins what at the olympics , because ` they 're all on something ''' , barnes  .
Argumentative	 new drugs such as the growth hormone epo are very difficult to detect , and the olympic authorities are not doing enough to overcome the problem -- stirring the negative public opinion .
Argumentative	 though the ioc claims to be clamping down on the drug problem , there were stillcases of doping at athens in, andcases in beijing , allen  , such cases only indicate the athletes taking known substances , or substances that can be tested for .
Argumentative	 the olympic motto of ` faster , higher , stronger ' is fatally undermined if athletes ' achievements are the result not of physical and mental strain , but chemical concoction .
Argumentative	 the ioc and many national olympic committees lack integrity , and this kills the games ' spirit and pretensions to fair play .
Argumentative	 officials working for the salt lake citybid are believed to have spent more than $million on ` gifts and favors ' for ioc members in an effort to bribe their way to the victory .1 furthermore , in response to a bbc programme inwhich highlighted the corruption of members of fifa , football 's governing body , the ioc was forced to open an investigation into three of its own members who held posts at both organizations .2 the inability of the ioc to stamp out the corruption of its own members , or otherwise alter its voting system , reflects poorly on its commitment to excellence and fairness .
Argumentative	 if the ioc is charged with ensuring the propagation of the olympic dream , it is setting a poor example .
Argumentative	 the modern olympic athlete is no longer driven ` for the glory of sport ' , but by an appetite for excellence that can , and often does , override any notion of fair-play or respect .
Argumentative	 the sense of fraternity that olympic athletes once had is becoming lost in the antagonistic rivalries between nations and individual athletes and the pressure not merely to compete , but to win .
Argumentative	 we should have some sympathy with athletes sometimes : very often , they are compelled to take drugs by their team 's coach .
Argumentative	 the chinese swimming team , for example , was beset at atlanta by claims that they had adopted a systematic and untraceable doping regime to improve their athletes , with remarkable results .1 to overcome this , the ioc conference in februaryrecommended that coaches should take the olympic oath as well as athletes , however the document itself is so tarnished by the regularity with which it is ignored that it is fast becoming a farce .
Argumentative	 the olympics therefore may still be a great event , with many great athletes but it no longer carries the associations with respect and fair-play that made its dream so appealing to so many .
Argumentative	 the olympics have been hijacked so many times for political purposes that competition `` for the glory of sport '' can not help but have been smothered .
Argumentative	 the munich disaster inis the most shocking : nine israeli athletes were taken hostage by palestinian terrorists and eventually killed .
Argumentative	 yet the games were only suspended forhours ; it is as if those who play the games were less important than the spectacle of the games .
Argumentative	 when the usa boycotted themoscow games , they devalued still further the supremacy of sport for its own sake .
Argumentative	 in, a number of state leaders decided to boycott the beijing opening ceremony in protest of the chinese crackdown in tibet .1 in so doing , they essentially pull the focus of the event away from the athletes and sport and use it instead as a political tool .
Argumentative	 that is not the purpose of an event founded specifically to grant athletes the platform to shine .
