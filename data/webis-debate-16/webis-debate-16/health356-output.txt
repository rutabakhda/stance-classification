Non-Argumentative	drug companies like glaxosmithkline (gsk) and merck are amongst the most profitable companies in the world.
Non-Argumentative	 arguably the drugs they research and produce are among the most important products any company sells.
Non-Argumentative	 although the proposition could choose to discuss the advertising of non-prescription drugs, a better debate can be had over prescription drugs (drugs requiring a doctor’s authorization before a pharmacist can dispense them to a patient) because states across the world have taken very different positions on the issue.
Non-Argumentative	 only two countries currently allow the practice: the united states and new zealand.
Non-Argumentative	 however it has been considered elsewhere, including a proposal by the european commission in 2001, which suggested limited direct-to-consumer advertising (dtca), but which was rejected in 2003.
Non-Argumentative	while the eu does not have a regulated system some of the countries have certain exemptions for advertising: in france, dtca (direct to consumer advertising) of non-prescription medicines is permissible only if purchasers are not reimbursed by the social security system.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover, disease awareness campaigns are considered legal only if such campaigns do not refer directly or indirectly to the product or therapeutic class.
Non-Argumentative	 in spain, dtca is allowed only for medicines that treat minor symptoms.
Non-Argumentative	outside the us, new zealand, bangladesh and south korea allow limited dtc (direct to consumer) advertising, while in some other markets limited advertising has been permitted for certain vaccines.
Non-Argumentative	  the most attention, however, has been on whether europe will ever permit dtc — particularly as european regulators have often adapted a number of u.s. regulations for the region.
Non-Argumentative	the u.s. system dates fromlegislation and is administered by the food and drug administration (fda).
Non-Argumentative	 all adverts, which are predominantly television or print in form, must include a written (and voiced in the case of tv adverts) list of possible side effects and risks, as well as a phrase insisting consumers ask their doctors whether the drug is appropriate for them.
Non-Argumentative	 they now account for a large proportion of the us advertising market and are blamed by some for the rapid increase in us health costs.
Non-Argumentative	 others defend advertising as a helpful tool for matching the right drugs to the patients that need them.
Non-Argumentative	 should we allow direct advertisement of the prescription drugs to consumers or should the products be advertised mainly to physicians, as is the practice in europe?
Argumentative	   advertising serves an important purpose by informing the public about a specific product .
Argumentative	 it is also regulated from manipulation , and therefore deserves no special restrictions ; these same restrictions and watchdogs would be in place if advertising of drugs were allowed to make sure that no drug is misrepresented .
Argumentative	 we trust consumers to view adverts with a level of skepticism and we know that they form only one part of the research that goes into , say , buying a car .
Argumentative	 drug companies have become more open in recent years .
Argumentative	 for instance , gsk now publishes the results of all their drug trials , including the ones that fail , online and there are plenty of other sources of information on drugs available .
Argumentative	 a drug that remains unused is a drug that is helping nobody ; adverts are simply a reasonable way for drug companies to help consumers find out about their products within a safe and highly regulated environment .
Argumentative	 when the first discussion in the european parliament was started , regarding the advertisement of pharmaceuticals , the pharmaceutical industry specifically pointed out the anomaly that exists : `` specific laws stood in the way of it communicating with patients over its products , even when others could .
Argumentative	 presumably , this meant information was communicated by the media about new medicines .
Argumentative	 in this regard , the restrictions on the pharma industry contrast with the freedom enjoyed by manufacturers of vitamins and herbal remedies , who routinely advertise products to patients . ''
Argumentative	 this shows that it is unjust to make any differences between the companies .
Argumentative	 advertising prescription drugs enables patients to learn , and to request innovation faster in order to benefit from the new drugs that health personnel still have not gotten used to .
Argumentative	 advertising increases consumer awareness of drugs , which makes consumers more likely to take appropriate medication .
Argumentative	 the drugs market is complex and so advertising can help explain the differences between treatments , for example between contraceptive pills intended to reduce period pain , period flow and those simply to prevent pregnancy .
Argumentative	 advertising under current rules is used to inform patients of new drugs which may be appropriate for conditions which they suffer from , such as recent asthma drugs which reduce the frequency of attacks , but which their doctor might overlook or not have the time to crosscheck against her list of patients .
Argumentative	 56 % of ama general practitioners believed that direct-to-consumer advertising had prompted some of their patients to seek treatment for a condition which would have otherwise been neglected .
Argumentative	 if a patient has taken the time to actively consider a particular drug and then visits their doctor , whether they are prescribed it or not , they are building up a positive relationship with their doctor and are more likely to continue to take an active interest in their health .
Argumentative	 further on , in states where there is no direct to consumer advertising but there is advertising to doctors , patients are disadvantaged because it is in the interest for private medical insurance firms or national health services to keep information about expensive new drugs from patients .
Argumentative	 in the uk it was because of cost that the primary care trusts , pcts , refused to allow the prescription of herceptin , a drug which us studies have shown reduces the damage done by breast cancer .
Argumentative	 ultimately pressure from roche , the drug 's manufacturer and from patients resulted in the drug being authorized for use , but the process was much faster in the us where roche could run advertisements alerting consumers to the potential benefits of herceptin , and thereby immediately giving patients access to a similar level of information as their doctors and allowing them to push for its authorization .
Argumentative	 advertisements -- especially those that identify symptoms -- can lead to a healthier citizenry , as consumers become aware of their diseases earlier , and can thus find the drug that targets their problem at an earlier stage .
Argumentative	 many drugs can prevent or reduce the likelihood of a patient requiring surgery , for instance anti-cholesterol drugs can reduce the buildup of atheroma in blood vessels , which cause cardiovascular heart disease and strokes , thus reducing the likelihood of a heart bypass being required and improving any post-stroke rehabilitation .
Argumentative	 this not only saves money but is also better for patients .
Argumentative	 surgery involves the risk of complications as well as taking time both directly and in post-operation rehabilitation .
Argumentative	 also many degenerative conditions can be best treated by early intervention ; if patients are aware of the drugs that are available at an early stage they are more likely to take them , thereby increasing their standard of living and reducing their long-term cost to state or private health cover providers .
Argumentative	 we should not attack drugs companies for making profits from their products , nor for encouraging patients to use them .
Argumentative	 each new drug costs an average of $ 500m to produce and very small percentage of the drugs that are researched ever make it to the market .
Argumentative	 the more profitable the industry , the more new drugs it can afford to research and develop and thus the more patients who can receive appropriate treatment .
Argumentative	 many of the complex cures being developed for diseases like cancer , hiv/aids , sars and avian flu will take decades to research .
Argumentative	 in the meantime , drug companies require funding streams from other drugs to continue research .
Argumentative	 drugs have become increasingly expensive and advertisement helps to cover those costs .
Argumentative	 fromand, from about $billion , indollars , to $billion .
Argumentative	 there has been a real growth rate of aboutpercent a year , on average .
Argumentative	 by comparison , drug firms ' gross margins -- sales revenue minus costs and income taxes -- have been increasing more slowly , by aboutpercent annually .
Argumentative	 so , with more personalized medicine and greater costs in drug development , the industry needs a greater source of revenue in order to research therapeutics further .
Argumentative	 advertising would provide this revenue .
