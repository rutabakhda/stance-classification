Non-Argumentative	presidents have for decades asked for the power to cancel individual items of appropriations, with ronald reagan being particular vigorous in his demands for line-item veto authority.
Non-Argumentative	 technically the power is not one of absolute veto but means that when signing a bill a president would be able to notify congress of his intention not to spend one or more items of appropriation within it.
Non-Argumentative	 the campaign for a line-item veto was particularly strong in the mid-1990s when federal budget deficits concentrated minds on the need to combat wasteful spending, something that is once again relevant.
Non-Argumentative	 it was a provision in the republican's winningcontract with america manifesto1, and enacted in 1996.
Non-Argumentative	 under the line item veto act president clinton vetoeditems of spending from theappropriations bills, representing $1.9 billion of savings over five years; in one case congress overrode his decision by majority votes in each chamber.
Non-Argumentative	 however, the act was challenged in federal court by two groups who would have benefited from appropriations that clinton had vetoed, and inthe supreme court found the line item veto act to be unconstitutional as congress was not allowed to give up some of its powers to the executive branch.2sincethere have been several attempts to revisit the issue, with significant proposals inandof new bills that attempted to provide the president with line-item veto power in ways that could be considered constitutional.
Non-Argumentative	 these failed to become law and it is possible that the only way to create such a power is by amending the us constitution itself (as the supreme court decision noted in 1998).
Non-Argumentative	 as the federal deficit has once again grown and government waste has become a major political issue, there are renewed calls for a line-item veto to be introduced.
Non-Argumentative	this is potentially quite a technical debate but speakers would be well advised to base their case upon the main principles at stake.
Non-Argumentative	 it is worth noting that theact allowed clinton the power to cancel not only items in appropriations bills but also tax breaks affecting only small numbers of people.
Non-Argumentative	 and it gave him authority to cancel items directing government expenditure within committee reports accompanying spending bills, which by convention have been accepted by presidents as binding in the same way as appropriations in acts are.
Non-Argumentative	 whether a proposed constitutional amendment would have the same scope is a matter for argument among experts.
Argumentative	 although the potential for the veto is important most spending is not through appropriations at all, but on entitlements such as medicare and social security that are legislated in different ways and which would not be covered by either theact or more recent proposals to enhance presidential budgeting power.
Argumentative	the present system of earmarking in congress is wide open to abuse .
Argumentative	 the party leaderships in each house can use the offer of pork , or the threat to withhold it to enforce party discipline .
Argumentative	 `` logrolling '' occurs whereby an earmark is obtained in return for support on an unrelated piece of legislation .
Argumentative	 all this leads to legislators who put party above country and vote for bad legislation in pursuit of their own vested interest .
Argumentative	 they basically `` are federal dollars that members of congress dole out to favor seekers -- often campaign donors .
Argumentative	 in the process , lawmakers advocate for the companies , helping them bypass the normal system of evaluation and competition . ''
Argumentative	 1 forcing pork out in the open by making congress vote to defend it after a presidential line-item veto is the best way to remedy matters .
Argumentative	 overall the president is more accountable to the people as a whole than individual representatives , and with their national mandate , more able to stand up to powerful interest groups .
Argumentative	 the line item veto could prevent omnibus appropriations bills as with a possible veto there would be little advantage to congress in bundling such spending together .
Argumentative	 in recent decades , huge omnibus appropriations bills have become the norm , these are bills that `` package many , often unrelated , proposals in a single , very long piece of legislation ``.
Argumentative	 presidents have had to accept these bills in their entirety or see the federal government shut down for lack of spending authority .
Argumentative	 presidents from the 1790s tohad an impoundment power not to spend money which congress had appropriated .
Argumentative	 this power was lost in, with increasingly bloated budgets and pork barrel spending the result .
Argumentative	 congressman phil english has said that `` for far too long , presidents have had to adopt an '' all or nothing '' approach when considering action on bills containing appropriations .
Argumentative	 this presents a predicament for them when good policies are overloaded by unnecessary spending proposals .
Argumentative	 the case for this amendment was clearly demonstrated by the fy99 omnibus appropriations act last october .
Argumentative	 many provisions in this bill were last minute '' pork '' projects that should not have been included .
Argumentative	 ``amending the us constitution to allow the president a line-item veto would be fiscally responsible .
Argumentative	 congress has proved itself incapable of restraining spending , even as the budget deficit has ballooned in recent years .
Argumentative	 in fiscal yearthere were 11,610 earmarks -- specific appropriations requested by individual congressmen , mostly to benefit specific groups in their district or state - costing $ 17.2 billion with a total of $billion fromto 2008.1 many of these items are `` pork '' , using taxpayers ' money on projects of dubious value in order to ingratiate the congressman involved with groups of voters or interest groups .
Argumentative	 typically huge spending bills bloated with such wasteful appropriations are voted through by congressmen who have no opportunity or inclination to even read the whole thing .
Argumentative	 at present the president has to accept or sign the whole bill , despite their distaste for many of the items within it .
Argumentative	 the proposed amendment would change that and allow the president to sign the bill as a whole , while cancelling spending he regarded as wasteful , of low priority , or properly a matter for state or local government .
Argumentative	 all that is being proposed here is giving the president the same power enjoyed byout ofstate governors .
Argumentative	 one strength of a federal system is the way `` our states are our laboratories of democracy and we can look to them for the best practices and innovative ideas . ''
Argumentative	 they point the way to solutions that others , including the federal government , can adopt .
Argumentative	 and at state level the line-item veto power is very valuable in restraining spending and preventing waste ; congressman john baldacci argues that `` unlike the federal government , the states by and large do not run deficits and they keep their books in order and spend only what they have each year .
Argumentative	 they pass realistic budgets and they stick to them .
Argumentative	 it is certain that this authority is a crucial part of keeping spending in check .
Argumentative	 while it may not be used with great regularity in many states , the fact that it is available encourages the legislatures and the governor to reach agreement on spending issues and not to crowd the spending with extraneous matters .
Argumentative	 ``because it is used irregularly there has been no general erosion of legislative authority within these states .
