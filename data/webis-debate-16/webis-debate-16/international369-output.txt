Non-Argumentative	in 2009, the ugandan government made international headlines when a private members bill was put forward which would have incurred the death penalty or life imprisonment for anyone proven to be homosexual.
Non-Argumentative	 when uganda passed the bill four years later, with the exception of the death penalty, it served to highlight the prevailing attitudes in many african states towards the issue of homosexuality.
Non-Argumentative	as of 2013,of africa’srecognised sovereign states outlaw homosexuality.
Non-Argumentative	 while the degrees of enforcement and severity for these laws do vary from state to state, the criminalisation of homosexuality has caused great controversy in the west.
Non-Argumentative	 the majority of these states will not allow any form of same sex activity, even the possession of homosexual pornography can lead to a prison sentence.
Non-Argumentative	 international criticism for the outlawing of same-sex relations has seen a notable increase since ugandan member of parliament david bahati proposed his private member’s bill.
Non-Argumentative	 the obama administration’s opposition to the international criminalisation of homosexuality and britain’s proposals to reduce aid have increased the severity of the issue for many africans.
Argumentative	 from a moral perspective , it is wrong to discriminate against someone for their sexuality .
Argumentative	 everyone should have equal rights ; hilary clinton stated that ` gay rights are human rights ' , the derogation of such rights is a serious moral affront .
Argumentative	 there is evidence that homosexuality is not optional .
Argumentative	 discriminating on sexual orientation is therefore the same as discriminating upon factors such as race and ethnicity .
Argumentative	 even if changeable it would be the same as discrimination on the basis of identity or religion .
Argumentative	 same sex relations are victimless which calls in to question whether it could ever be defined as something to be criminalised .
Argumentative	 whilst some may point to male on male rape , these figures are low compared to male on female rape .
Argumentative	 in the u.s. where homosexuality is legal , only% of rape victims were male and only a small proportion of those being male on male .
Argumentative	 criminalising and institutionally embedding hatred against homosexuality has served to alienate many africans from their families and communities .
Argumentative	 discrimination on the basis of homosexuality is not something any donor would want to endorse even implicitly it is therefore morally right to cut the aid .
Argumentative	 if the west did decide to reduce aid to african states it could pressure african states to change their policies on homosexuality .
Argumentative	 africa is renowned for the dependency on aid .
Argumentative	 analysts claim that this dependency negates the need for african economies to reform , relying instead on foreign governments and ngos .
Argumentative	 this reliance on aid could be exploited to alter policy within those african countries that are unable to act economically independently .
Argumentative	 this policy has been successful in the past .
Argumentative	 when britain cut # 19m to malawi infor arresting two men for marrying ; there was a reversal of government policy in the african state and all anti-homosexual laws were suspended .
Argumentative	 the equality created by this policy change would allow greater access to retroviral drugs and other hiv/aids treatment for the gay community .
Argumentative	 laws outlawing homosexuality , and the stigma of the false connection between hiv and homosexuality , have decreased the accessibility of the gay community to treatment .
Argumentative	 corrections to these laws , from the economic pressure of aid withdrawal , would allow those with hiv/aids in the gay community to seek help without fear of rejections or prosecution .
Argumentative	 when western states threaten to cut aid , they are referring to their own money .
Argumentative	 this money should therefore be spent at the discretion of the donating country .
Argumentative	 in, the usa 's and uk 's budgets for aid were # 12.2 billion and #billion respectively .
Argumentative	 the uk 's spending is set to increase to about # 11.3 billion by.
Argumentative	 this is money which could be spent to ease economic hardships at home , as many newspapers have pointed out , however it is given to other countries to aid them instead .
Argumentative	 donating states also spend a great deal of time attempting to convince their citizens that giving aid is a good use of their money .
Argumentative	 should they oppose a policy which they see as discriminatory then it is understandable that they should use their discretion when donating aid .
