Non-Argumentative	the issue of big versus small government is a significant in the election campaigns of many countries – and has recently been the subject of many hysterical pronouncements in the us.
Non-Argumentative	 in reality no incoming government does that much to change the overall size of government as there are, in practice, only so many savings that can be made or new initiatives that can be launched within the confines of acceptable levels of taxation.
Non-Argumentative	this argument is a particularly interesting one to study in the us as it is so ripe for the pricking of illusions on both sides of the political divide.
Non-Argumentative	even arriving at a definition of what is meant by ‘the size of government’ is problematic.
Non-Argumentative	 as this debate will focus on the united states, it may be worth dealing with a few popular misconceptions before they take hold, although there is plenty of room to work around these, as will be demonstrated in the substantive material itself.
Non-Argumentative	partisans on both sides would find explanations for these figures, which, in reality, would have little to do with reality.
Non-Argumentative	 instead it should be noting that this debate has more to do with (in addition to sophistic rhetoric) the attitudes and intentions of the two great tribal herds of us politics than it does with anything else.
Non-Argumentative	 it is, ultimately, a debate about political philosophy rather than political economy.
Non-Argumentative	 the fact that the cost of government has increased under every single successive president is one universally ignored.
Non-Argumentative	 such counter-intuitive realities can be observed in a huge number of political situations; it really say anything surprising about politics but is a good reason to double check the facts relied on by participants in a debate.
Non-Argumentative	essentially the philosophical differences are these: those in favor of small government believe that individuals, their families and communities are better placed than the state to help themselves and those around.
Non-Argumentative	 by doing so, individuals learn valuable skills of self-reliance and self-respect.
Non-Argumentative	 by contrast those who favor government-led action tend to believe that society as a whole should take responsibility for ensuring a certain quality of living for all its members and that by ensuring that there is a safety net people are better able to overcome transient crises or social inequalities in order to become helpful members of society.
Non-Argumentative	the other key aspect of the debate is the role of taxation in society.
Non-Argumentative	 those in favor of small government tend to believe that reducing the overall tax burden will stimulate the economy as a whole, by promoting enterprise, investment and entrepreneurialism.
Non-Argumentative	 they say that this, in turn creates jobs and “wealth”.
Non-Argumentative	 small government conservatives generally abide by the mantra that individuals know how to spend their money better than the federal government does.
Non-Argumentative	those associated with a big government approach tend to favor the use of tax as a redistributive system arguing that by taking a small amount from those who can afford it (obviously one person’s ‘small’ is not that of another) the government can use it to improve services such as education across the board, to everyone’s benefit.
Argumentative	 government , especially in a developed nation and even more so in the wealthiest nation in the world , should be able to ensure that children are not hungry , the mentally ill are not living on the streets , borders are policed , veterans do n't live in squalor , the population can read , crime is controlled , the elderly do n't freeze to death and a million other markers of a civilized society .
Argumentative	 this is particularly true of children but most people need a helping hand at one time or another in life .
Argumentative	 however , the obscenity of children destined to fail before their lives have even started - condemned to schools that offer no hope and communities that offer no safety - would be disturbing anywhere in the world .
Argumentative	 all of the indicators mentioned above have been adversely affect during the thirty year obsession with pushing the government back in the name of handing unfettered control over to big business and the vicissitudes of the market .
Argumentative	 nobody would deny the role that remarkable individuals have played in the major social changes of history .
Argumentative	 they have , however , ultimately required the actions of government .
Argumentative	 many of these have been achieved despite , rather than because of , the interests of business .
Argumentative	 critically they have tended to be to the benefit of the weak , the vulnerable and the neglected .
Argumentative	 governments have been responsible for social reforms ranging from the abolition of slavery and child labor to the removal of conditions in factories and on farms that lead to injury and death , in addition to minimum wage regulations that meant that families could feed themselves .
Argumentative	 by contrast , the market was quite happy with cheap cotton sown by nimble young fingers .
Argumentative	 in turn profit was given preference over any notion of job security or the right to a family life , the market was quite happy to see water poisoned and the air polluted -- and in many cases is still happy with it .
Argumentative	 the logic of the market panders to slave-labor wages to migrant workers or exporting jobs where migrants are not available .
Argumentative	 either way it costs the jobs of american citizens , pandering to racism and impoverishing workers at home and abroad .
Argumentative	 although the prophets of the market suggest that the only thing standing between the average american and a suburban home - with a pool , 4x4 and an overflowing college-fund is the government , the reality could not be further from the truth .
Argumentative	 the simple reality of the market is this : the profit motive that drives the system is the difference between the price of labor , plant and materials on one hand and the price that can be charged on the other .
Argumentative	 it makes sense to find the workers who demand the lowest wages , suppliers who can provide the cheapest materials and communities desperate enough to sell their air , water and family time .
Argumentative	 whether those are at home or abroad .
Argumentative	 the market , by its nature has no compassion , no patriotism and no loyalty .
Argumentative	 the only organization that can act as a restraint on that is , in the final reckoning , government which has legislative power to ensure that standards are maintained .
Argumentative	 it is easy to point to individual acts that have been beneficial but the reality is that the untrammeled market without government oversight has had a depressing tendency to chase the easiest buck , ditch the weakest , exploit where it can , pollute at will , corrupt where necessary and bend , break or ignore the rules .
Argumentative	 it requires government as the agent of what the people consider acceptable to constrain the profit motive .
Argumentative	 government expenditure is the single biggest tool in times of economic difficulty .
Argumentative	 those that are the quickest to complain about taxation and regulation during the good times are also the fastest to rush for a bailout during the lean times .
Argumentative	 likewise , those that call for tax cuts in a boom also tend to be the first to criticize a deficit or public expenditure during a recession .
Argumentative	 there is in all of this one simple economic reality : the government acts as the banker of last resort .
Argumentative	 this only works , as keynes understood , if the government holds on to reserves in the good years so that it can spend them in the tough ones to stimulate jobs and growth .
Argumentative	 on the other hand , where surpluses are blown on tax cuts - or expensive wars for that matter - then will be nothing left in the bank and government can not fulfill its most useful role of using its own financial clout to balance the economy over the course of a financial cycle .
Argumentative	 so-called small government conservatives have been consistently profligate in recent history and have tended to leave fiscally cautious liberals to pick up the pieces .
Argumentative	 the party of small government never seems to find itself short of billions of dollars for expensive white elephants like the sdi missile shield or asserting american military power overseas in pursuit of yet another doomed cause -- whether that 's ' propping up latin american dictators or settling familial grudge matches in the middle east .
Argumentative	 the military adventurism of the reagan presidency as well as those of both bush senior and junior were conducted not just at the cost of domestic social stability , but also fiscal security .
Argumentative	 instead of preserving a budget surplus from the clinton presidency , the bush administration spent it recklessly -- not , as is widely declared , on the war against terror -- on tax cuts for the wealthiest in society .
Argumentative	 as a result bush , his cabinet and his backers robbed the country of the possibility of reserves when the economy was in a less positive situation .
Argumentative	 so called ` big government ' , withholding surpluses for a rainy day , provides financial security for american businesses and workers .
Argumentative	 so-called ` small-government ' presidents spend trillions of dollars on free money to the super-rich and on military adventurism in other countries and , apparently , in space .
