Non-Argumentative	sex education has been taught in schools in a range of countries around the world for nearly a century in various forms it has become a fixture in schools in most western countries.
Non-Argumentative	 the specifics of the education program vary between countries, but they all generally deal with the basics of reproduction, physiological development, sexual health, practice, and safety.
Non-Argumentative	 in recent decades many countries, such as germany sinceand sweden as far back as 1956, have made sex education a mandatory part of schooling, a policy that has been met with extensive criticism, particularly from religious groups.
Non-Argumentative	 their criticism is that sex education is permissive toward young people’s sexual relationships and thus morally corrosive.
Non-Argumentative	opposition also derives from an objection to an extension of the state’s involvement into the family and questions of sexuality.
Non-Argumentative	 in developing countries sex education schemes have developed in part at least to attempt to stem the  hiv/aids epidemic,although some religious groups have opposed these developments.
Non-Argumentative	 in western nations howeversex education is not always mandatory, in  england and wales for example parents can refuse to let their children take part in some although not in all lessons which provide information about sex and reproduction.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents of mandatory sex education highlight the benefits it provides in delaying the age of first intercourse, preventing sexually transmitted disease and teenage pregnancy and in providing useful information for life regarding sexuality and sexual expression.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents contend that sex education encourage early sexual relationships and the risks which attend that and  should be the purview of parents, and that forcing it to be provided in schools undermines trust in the education system and harms the individuals’ relationship with the state and society.
Argumentative	 it was said at the beginning of the hiv/aids epidemic that the only vaccination against the virus was knowledge .
Argumentative	 knowledge about what is out there is essential to guarding the self .
Argumentative	 there are a several of ways in which this knowledge is essential ; finding out about the risks of sex is just one , having accurate information about the pleasures as well as the risks is another .
Argumentative	 knowledge also prevents misinformation .
Argumentative	 young people must be informed about sex , how it works and what the risks associated with it are , and how to access the risks and the pleasures .
Argumentative	 when sex is not talked about and kept behind closed doors , young people are forced often to grope around in the dark , so to speak .
Argumentative	 this can result in unwanted pregnancies , and even stds , some of which can be permanent , a threat to fertility or even life threatening .
Argumentative	 it leaves young people confused .
Argumentative	 the state thus owes an obligation to its citizens to prepare them adequately for their interactions in society , including those of a sexual nature .
Argumentative	 a mandatory sex education regime serves as a defence against misinformation about sex .
Argumentative	 religious organizations , most notably in the united states , promote abstinence by lying about the effectiveness of contraception and about the transmission of stds .
Argumentative	 when such activity is not countered by a scientific explanation of sex and sexual practices a culture of ignorance develops that can have serious negative social and health effects on those who are misinformed .
Argumentative	 an example of the benefits of sex education is highlighted in the case of the united states .
Argumentative	 in primarily liberal states where sex education is mandatory , young people are statistically more likely to be sexually active .
Argumentative	 at the same time in states where sex education is banned or deliberately misleading , teen pregnancy rates are much higher .
Argumentative	 clearly the trade-off between high promiscuity rates on the one hand and much higher rates of teen pregnancy and stds on the other stands in the favour of sex education .
Argumentative	 young people live now in a society which is very sexualised it has been described as a carnal jungle .
Argumentative	 adults need to offer guidance about negotiating a way through the messages about sex which proliferate in the mass media and consumer culture .
Argumentative	 underlying this discussion is controversy about what sex education should be .
Argumentative	 sex education has become a shorthand term for the broader subject of personal relationships , sexual health and education about sexuality it is clear that views about what sex education should be and what it should contain has changed significantly over time .
Argumentative	 high quality sex education should not only contain factual information about the physiological issues of sexual development and reproduction .
Argumentative	 it should also offer safe spaces for young people to consider the social and emotional aspects of sexuality and the social and peer pressures that arise in youth cultures .
Argumentative	 sex and sexual identity is fundamental part of human life .
Argumentative	 sexual desire , for both procreation and recreation , forms one of the core human drives that shapes behaviour .
Argumentative	 young people want to explore their own , and one another 's , bodies from quite an early age , long before they would be likely to settle down and get married .
Argumentative	 sex for almost everyone in western countries is not something exclusive to marriage , and most people have multiple sexual partners in their lifetimes .
Argumentative	 in order to face this reality , young people must be armed with the knowledge of what sexual intercourse entails and the pleasures and the risks inherent in it .
Argumentative	 sexual identity itself can be very confusing , especially for young homosexual or transgender people who may not understand their sexuality .
Argumentative	 a safe , objective environment in which the objective physical facts and the emotional aspects of sexual involvement and activity is provided is essential to facilitate young people to come to grips with sexual identity as it is essential for full development as a person .
Argumentative	 parents have a great deal of responsibility in raising children , but they are unsuited to teaching about sexuality as the resulting education will not be consistent , be biased and in some cases may not be carried out at all .
Argumentative	 parents tend to view their children as less sexualized ; they want them to be innocent .
Argumentative	 thus it is often the case that parents seek to shield their children from the realities of sex , and themselves from the young person 's developing sexuality maintaining their innocence through enforced ignorance .
Argumentative	 this tends to be particularly harmful to young women , as culturally boys are often expected to be more sexually active than girls , and such activity is usually considered appropriate for boys , while not so for girls .
Argumentative	 a double standard undoubtedly continues to exist .
Argumentative	 it is in the interest of the state , however , to produce well-rounded individuals who can interact with society effectively on all levels , including the sexual level .
Argumentative	 when parents do not provide adequate sex education , it is the state that is forced to pick up the tab to pay for std treatment and teen mothers .
Argumentative	 people dropping out of school due to pregnancy , and individuals who are unable to work due to debilitating venereal disease impose a steep cost on society .
Argumentative	 it is thus the state 's duty to provide what parents often can not for the sake of society as a whole .
Argumentative	 leaving sex education in the hands of parents has the further negative impact of normalizing incorrect or bigoted views regarding sexuality .
Argumentative	 homophobic families , for example , will not be able to provide the necessary information to homosexual children , who will suffer not only from lack of education , but also from a lack of sexual self-worth .
Argumentative	 mandatory sex education can right the wrongs of such misinformation and bias .
Argumentative	 communities and organizations that oppose sex education can actually benefit from it .
Argumentative	 unfortunately this is often not appreciated by the communities involved .
Argumentative	 one argument is that shielding children from knowledge of sex and sexual practice is disrespectful to religion .
Argumentative	 religious and moral abstinence is defined by the decision not to have sex , not by the absence of knowledge of the existence of sex itself .
Argumentative	 sex education can even be beneficial to understanding the religious and ethical perspective toward sexuality when it provides necessary discussion of the emotional aspects of sexuality .
Argumentative	 information simply allows people to make fuller , informed decisions .
Argumentative	 sex education does not serve to normalize sexual activity and lewd behavior , as religious groups fear , because everything in life is already sexualized .
Argumentative	 one need only watch a typical perfume ad on television to know that sexuality inculcates popular culture already .
Argumentative	 sex education would not lift the scales from the eyes of children entirely ; they already have some idea of what is going on .
Argumentative	 the danger is when they know something about sex , but not enough to be safe .
Argumentative	 that is why mandatory sex education is essential to people 's wellbeing .
Argumentative	 the research evidence from across the world is clear that sex education holds back the age of first intercourse and most certainly does not foster early promiscuity .
Argumentative	 the abstinence programmes that have been developed in the united states in particular have been spectacularly unsuccessful in reducing rates of sexual exploration and std and unwanted pregnancy rates .
Argumentative	 research has made it clear which kinds of sex education are most effective .
