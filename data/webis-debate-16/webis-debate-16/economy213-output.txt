Non-Argumentative	the advent of computing has allowed governments, businesses and individuals to store, collate, analyse, and utilize huge amounts of data.
Non-Argumentative	 firms have made use of this power to store the personal data of their customers in order to better understand them and to cater to their needs.
Non-Argumentative	 others have even used the data online to offer targeted marketing aimed at the personal profiles of individuals, often created by way of information gleaned from cookies, search histories, etc. that give them a window on the sorts of people using their services.
Non-Argumentative	 sometimes even phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses are sold in this way.
Non-Argumentative	 databrokers such as choicepoint and acxiom purchase data from many sources, including government agencies, businesses, credit bureaus and investigators.
Non-Argumentative	 they then offer “analytical services” on millions of households.
Non-Argumentative	 this collation and utilization of data has spawned a secondary market in which firms have sold on their compiled data on individuals to other companies seeking to better understand the marketplace and to find consumers for their products.
Non-Argumentative	 it is a booming $300 billion-a-year industry.
Non-Argumentative	this vast increase in the dissemination and use of individuals’ private data has resulted in extensive debates across the world, and has spawned many laws, that mandate privacy controls and strict regulation of how this information is used.
Non-Argumentative	 however as the gathering and use of data rapidly changes the law often struggles to keep up.
Non-Argumentative	 the european union for example is in the process of reforming its data protection rules that it implemented in 1995.
Non-Argumentative	 the debate is a serious one, because at its heart is the question of what information people use in their commercial dealings should be accessible permanently by firms and which can actually be distributed to someone willing to pay for.
Non-Argumentative	 for those who wish to prevent companies from collecting this information this represents a serious violation of privacy and runs the risk of data being misused by firms, and misappropriated by even less savoury institutions, such as hackers.
Non-Argumentative	 their opponents, particularly business, on the other hand contend that the efficiency and targeting gains generated by this information-gathering has allowed firms to offer more and better services to consumers, enriching their lives.
Non-Argumentative	the following debate addresses all these issues, focusing on the ethics of the data storage and whether in fact it can lead to meaningfully better outcomes both for consumers and companies.
Argumentative	 the gathering of personal data that companies undertake is done in a fashion that is fundamentally invasive of individuals ' privacy .
Argumentative	 when individuals go online they act as private parties , often enjoying anonymity in their personal activities .
Argumentative	 companies , particular online services , collate information and seek to use it to market products and services that are specifically tailored to those individuals .
Argumentative	 in the context of the internet , this means that individuals ' activities online are in fact susceptible to someone else 's interference and oversight , stealing from them the privacy and security the internet has striven to provide since its inception .
Argumentative	 at the most basic level , the invasion of privacy that collating and using private data gleaned from customers is unacceptable .
Argumentative	 there is a very real risk of the information being misused , as the data can be held , and even resold to third parties that the customers never consented to giving their data and might well not want to come into possession of their personal details .
Argumentative	 this can lead to serious abuses of individuals ' private information by corporations , or indeed other agents that might have less savoury uses for the information , most obviously the more places your personal information is the more likely it is to be lost in a data breach with 267million records exposed in.
Argumentative	 even when the information is not exposed it may be used in ways that have a real impact on the individual such as determining credit scores .
Argumentative	 people as a matter of principle should have control over who gets access to their private information .
Argumentative	 giving companies that are driven by profit motive to sell on their customers ' data to anyone that might offer a suitable price stands as an absolute theft of personal information and privacy .
Argumentative	 people experiencing the use of their personal details by companies have largely been found to see the process as extremely invasive and unsettling .
Argumentative	 many have felt violated by the exploitation of their personal lives to market them products , often from people to whom they never consented to hand over information .
Argumentative	 this feeling has been demonstrated through significant public outcry and backlash , as well as empirical results showing these attitudes becoming more and more widespread , particularly in the case of online targeted advertising , which is the most well-known use of personal information .
Argumentative	 the best example of such backlash is the result of amazon.com 's `` dynamic pricing '' system , in which the company varied its offerings and pricings to customers based on information gathered about them from prior uses .
Argumentative	 the result was a severe backlash that cost amazon business until it ended the policy .
Argumentative	 this has led to a blunting of the desired outcome of such marketers who experience declines in uptake rather than increased and more efficient reach of marketing .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the targeted marketing that arises from these forms of information storage and sale can tend toward stereotypes , using programmes that favour broad brushstrokes in their marketing , resulting in stereotyped services on the basis of apparent race and gender .
Argumentative	 when this happens it is all the more alienating .
Argumentative	 the data collected and sold by companies is not safe .
Argumentative	 servers with even the most sophisticated security systems are susceptible to hackers and other miscreants seeking to exploit the personal data of unsuspecting customers .
Argumentative	 identity theft is a ubiquitous threat in the information age , one that increases every year as the arms race between data protection designers and invaders rages on .
Argumentative	 data breaches have been rapidly increasing and although the total number declined frommillion exposed records intomillion inthis has increasingly been due to hacking rather than simple negligence .
Argumentative	 the result of these breaches is huge costs to individuals who have their identities and also to firms that appear to be unsafe .
Argumentative	 as individuals see companies as being uncaring of their information they tend to punish them in the market .
Argumentative	 there is no opt-in because the individual has no means of seeing to whom the data is sold , and how secure their servers might be , putting them doubly at risk .
Argumentative	 firms are better off not playing with fire and keeping data that could have huge potential costs to them if it is lost , and individuals are better off not having their information disseminated across cyberspace without any guarantee of its safety .
