Non-Argumentative	many of the arguments in this debate relate directly to interpretation of the second amendment to the constitution of the united states of america: "a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to bear arms, shall not be infringed.
Non-Argumentative	"a number of questions frame the  second amendment.
Non-Argumentative	 is it important in the modern day to offer citizens a right to gun ownership for the purpose of protecting against government tyranny?
Non-Argumentative	 would handguns be a necessary part of this check against an excessively powerful state?
Non-Argumentative	 what kinds of arms are necessary to an individual's ability to defend themselves and their family?
Non-Argumentative	 are handguns necessary?
Non-Argumentative	 do arms, and the right to bear them, increase violence, crime, and murder rates.
Non-Argumentative	 does a right to bear arms generally decrease public safety?
Non-Argumentative	 or, does an entitlement to carry handguns empower good citizens to take action against, "check", and generally deter bad citizens from committing crimes?
Non-Argumentative	 are handguns particularly conducive to gang violence because they are concealable?
Non-Argumentative	 or does the wide availability of firearms deter gangsters (creating a fear and uncertainty among criminals that good citizens are carrying them)?
Non-Argumentative	 are dc's circumstances exceptional?
Non-Argumentative	 does its history of crime and violence warrant exceptional measures such as a handgun ban?
Non-Argumentative	 does its status as the nation's capital also mean that exceptional cautions must be taken?
Non-Argumentative	in this debate, proposition should seek to propose a motion that implements a ban similar to the originalprohibition – restricting the sale and possession of handguns that are not already registered to a particular owner.
Non-Argumentative	 they can choose to implement a system where remaining guns are phased out over time with some measure of gun amnesty.
Non-Argumentative	 (a process where the remaining guns are given anonymously to the police).
Non-Argumentative	 it is important to note that opposition arguments along the line that the ban would be unconstitutional do not stand up in british parliamentary debating, unless significant harm from changing the constitution can be proved.
Non-Argumentative	 this is because british parliamentary debating assumes that the legislation will pass without hindrance should proposition win and that measures to allow this will be implemented.
Non-Argumentative	 as such a change in the constitution to make the handgun ban legal is assumed to be possible under the terms of the debate.
Non-Argumentative	 consequently, proposition’s burden in this debate is to show that such a ban would be beneficial and justifiable, not to show that it would be constitutional.
Argumentative	 under the status quo the state exists to protect the security of its citizens .
Argumentative	 it does so by maintaining a monopoly of violence with the consent of its citizens .
Argumentative	 us citizens have been allowed to bear small arms as a symbolic representation of their ability to rise up against state oppression should it ever occur .
Argumentative	 that is , to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has .
Argumentative	 it is important to note that the state has the monopoly of violence such that it can protect its citizens in the best possible way .
Argumentative	 in the same way , the right to bear arms exists such that citizens can protect themselves and prevent harm .
Argumentative	 this means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state .
Argumentative	 in a similar fashion to the above , should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another , it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state 's monopoly on violence is revoked , the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked .
Argumentative	 given that this does not occur in every single part of the u.s. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated .
Argumentative	 in this case the ban is limited to dc however it could potentially extend to other areas in the u.s. which suffer similar problems .2 handguns are specifically worse than most other weapons .
Argumentative	 they are weapons which are both concealable and portable .
Argumentative	 shotguns and rifles can easily be identified from a long distance making it easier to avoid those who are carrying them or conversely for the authorities check their motives for carrying arms .
Argumentative	 handguns , being ranged weapons , as opposed to knives , prevent people from opting to run away if they are confronted by an attacker and being concealable prevent any attempt at avoiding those carrying them .
Argumentative	 because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police .
Argumentative	 further , they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves , but also need to appear unassuming for clients .
Argumentative	 as such , handguns , where they are freely available , are often used by most criminals for these purposes .
Argumentative	 given that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries - as a result of incompetence or recklessness - than a knife , it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available .4 aside from the fact that handguns are uniquely dangerous weapons , when the handgun ban was in place in dc , there was a reported decrease in crime in the area .
Argumentative	 inthe year immediately following the ban the u.s. conference of mayors reported robberies , assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in dc sharply .
Argumentative	 further , inthe university of maryland published a study in the new england journal of medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before, claiming that the ban had preventeddeaths in dc per year .5 it is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics , such as stop and search , significantly more effective .
Argumentative	 if criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it .
Argumentative	 however , it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large .
Argumentative	 specifically , the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are , but simply ca n't pin them for arrest , such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street .
