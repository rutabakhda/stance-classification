Non-Argumentative	human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) in people, a condition in which the patient’s immune system is progressively compromised until it is unable to combat opportunistic infections and cancers.
Non-Argumentative	  hiv progresses to aids at a very variable rate that depends upon the health of the patient but on average takes aroundyears.
Non-Argumentative	 a person with aids will only survive for about a year without treatment, but in a western state with access to the latest treatments life expectancy can be raised to several decades.
Non-Argumentative	  like all viruses hiv is incurable and it has proven difficult to develop a vaccine.
Non-Argumentative	  the main routes of hiv infection are through blood transfusions (largely eliminated in the developed world by screening), unsafe sex, contaminated needles and mother-to-daughter transmission either in the womb or though breast milk.
Non-Argumentative	 hiv is therefore a disease which is very difficult to transmit, yet at the same time extremely lethal.
Non-Argumentative	  it’s been estimated that aids killedmillion people betweenand 2005, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in recorded history.
Non-Argumentative	  even in the developed world, hiv infection is a life changing event that will require the patient to carefully adjust many aspects of their life.
Non-Argumentative	  they will have to participate in a rigorous anti-viral treatment regime that requires taking drugs several times a day.
Non-Argumentative	  an employer may (depending on the circumstances) have serious concerns about the hiv status of his employees given the possible risks to themselves, to other employees, and to their future within the business.
Argumentative	 it 's in the interests of employers .
Argumentative	 a long , incurable and debilitating condition has stricken one of their employees .
Argumentative	 they will have to make provision for possible sickness cover and replacement workers , potentially for medical and/or retirement costs .
Argumentative	 hiv can make people tired and can lead to being sick more often as it means the immune system will not be able to fight off infections as well as it normally would .
Argumentative	 the employee 's productivity might be reduced to the point at which their continued employment is no longer viable .
Argumentative	 if things are made difficult for employers with hiv positive workers , then they are less likely in the future to employ people who , they suspect , are hiv positive .
Argumentative	 employers must be listened to in this debate -- in many hiv-stricken countries , they 're the last thing between a semi-functioning society and complete economic and social collapse .
Argumentative	 traditional rights ideas such as concerns about privacy of medical records are less important than the benefit to society of being able to cope with the unique problem of hiv more effectively .
Argumentative	 it 's in the interests of the hiv positive employee .
Argumentative	 right now , although in many countries it is illegal to fire someone for having hiv prejudiced employers can claim that they did n't know their employer had hiv when they fired him , so they must have been acting on other grounds .
Argumentative	 the employee then has to try and prove that they did know , which can be very hard .
Argumentative	 furthermore , once informed the employer can reasonably be expected to display a minimum level of understanding and compassion to the employee .
Argumentative	 it 's in the interests of other workers .
Argumentative	 the possibility of transmission , while very unlikely , is real and one they have a right to know about so as to be able to guard against it .
Argumentative	 while most of the time it will not be problem as transmission requires a transfer of bodily fluids this may occasionally happen in a workplace .
Argumentative	 this is particularly true of healthworkers , e.g. doctors , nurses , dentists , midwives , paramedics , etc , who should have both a moral and a legal obligation to disclose if they are hiv-positive .
Argumentative	 even outside the medical field industrial accidents may expose employees to risk .
Argumentative	 employers have a duty to protect their workforce .
Argumentative	 businesses ought to take a responsible and active position on hiv .
Argumentative	 the issue is n't going to go away .
Argumentative	 successful programs designed to help hiv-positive employees remain in the workplace for as long as they want to do so should be developed .
Argumentative	 procedures for treating personnel with fairness and dignity must be put in place .
Argumentative	 the potential fears and prejudices of other employees must be combated .
Argumentative	 the beginning of that process is ensuring they know about the problem and , crucially , the scale of it .
Argumentative	 without knowledge of the numbers involved , employers may put in place inadequate medical and pensions arrangements that will ultimately prove inadequate .
