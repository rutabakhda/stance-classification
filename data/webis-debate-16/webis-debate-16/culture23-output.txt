Non-Argumentative	the feminist movement is difficult to define.
Non-Argumentative	 in essence, it is composed of people who adhere to an ideology, feminism, which originates from philosophical principles of equality.
Non-Argumentative	 as such, they oppose any kind of dehumanisation or exploitation, in particular when targeted at women.
Non-Argumentative	 in practice, feminists are particularly opposed to the existence of patriarchal structures in society and to the social construction of gender, as opposed to sex.
Non-Argumentative	 this common ideology has led to some great successes for feminism in the past, such as women’s right to vote since the 19th or 20th centuries, or equal pay in most developed countries.
Non-Argumentative	 (global wage report 2012/13: wages and equitable growth)it is important to note that the feminist movement is, however, severely fragmented on more nuances social questions.
Non-Argumentative	 on particular issues such as prostitution or the burka, many feminists disagree as to what empowers women and what oppresses them, as to what liberates women because they do so freely, and what harms them because are pressured to do it by the patriarchy.
Non-Argumentative	pornography is a particularly contentious issue.
Non-Argumentative	 we take pornography to be any sexually explicit material, usually commercially distributed, acted or containing acting with the intention to arouse its viewers.
Non-Argumentative	 it is currently legal in most liberal countries, although iceland, for instance, is attempting to ban it in the near future (henscher).
Non-Argumentative	 where it is not yet illegal, it is under serious scrutiny: its currently immense role in society (over 70% of young men are estimated to watch porn at least once a month (paul)) gives it great leverage in promoting, or reverting, social change.
Non-Argumentative	 social change, arguably, is the next key fight for the feminist movement.
Non-Argumentative	 the question, then, comes down to whether pornography is a causal factor or a potential solution of the status quo of social oppression of women.
Argumentative	 in most cases , pornography is not entered into willingly .
Argumentative	 similarly to prostitution , the sale of one 's own body and one 's dignity is so drastic that consent is often not sufficiently informed to be legitimate .
Argumentative	 there are patriarchal structures in society that force women into these industries , particularly when they are vulnerable and this seems to be a good last resort .
Argumentative	 this leads to a loss of integrity , a strong stigma in society , and most importantly , abusive conditions in the production process .
Argumentative	 as well as high risks of unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases , violent sex practices and abusive conditions after filming often occur , lubben .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the harms of pornography do not exclusively affect the consenting participants .
Argumentative	 other women across the world who are not supporting this industry are equal victims of society and the norms promoted by pornography of how women should be , and how it is acceptable to treat them .
Argumentative	 these people have not consented .
Argumentative	 pornography necessarily objectifies people : it presents a sexual desire , an urge , which is immediately attended by another person , often performing acts which we would find demeaning , until the original urge is satisfied .
Argumentative	 the use of others for pleasure treats them as means to one 's own ends , and denies them any value as rational subjects with a will of their own .
Argumentative	 this affects , naturally , the participants in pornography , but also their viewers who adopt corrupted notions of what to value in others , and furthermore other women who are later affected by men using the same metric to interact with them .
Argumentative	 pornography presents a distorted perception of people , sexuality , and relationships , which has a further effect on a broader societal level .
Argumentative	 it promotes unreachable ideals of how both women and men should be in bed , and pushes both in the direction of what is idealised in pornography .
Argumentative	 this may push men to be more dominating than otherwise and women to suffer from anorexia , low self-esteem , and promiscuity .
Argumentative	 we can expect women to be the most affected by this , simply because the porn industry is owned almost entirely by men , and because there are pre-existing patriarchal structures in society ready to promote the idea that women are there to serve men .
Argumentative	 altogether , pornography merely promotes a new stereotype : that women are generally happy to have sex at any time , that they will respond positively to any man 's advances , and if a woman does not , there is something wrong with her .
Argumentative	 many forms of media are often accused of inciting violence , promoting stereotypes , or indoctrinating in some form or another .
Argumentative	 while this is contentious , the key principle that ` sex sells ' is more obvious .
Argumentative	 pornography is not like other media in that , while most other films are aimed at entertainment , this is aimed at arousal .
Argumentative	 that is , it is aimed at immediate and fully selfish pleasure , which is much more forceful and addictive than mere laughter .
Argumentative	 the psychological effect of pornography is harmful due to the associations it conditions its audience to make .
Argumentative	 it eroticises violence through portrayals , fake or genuine , of rape and a general treatment of women that is comparable to torture , yet presented in a context that necessarily biologically excites its viewers .
Argumentative	 through continuous exposure to the link between abuse and intense pleasure , this link is easily extended to personal relationships .
Argumentative	 the master-slave dialectic suddenly becomes acceptable .
Argumentative	 compulsive rapists , such as ted bundy , are often found to have consumed mass amounts of pornography , benson .
Argumentative	 more subtle , yet certainly still present is the force of such associations on young teenagers who have not yet had a sexual relationship and rely on pornography for guidance .
Argumentative	 this has a potentially massive impact given thatis the average age of first internet porn exposure , techmedia network .
