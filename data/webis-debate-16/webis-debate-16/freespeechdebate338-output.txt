Non-Argumentative	human rights come from the need to protect individuals from the arbitrary power of the state.
Non-Argumentative	 human rights are “international norms that help to protect all people everywhere from severe political, legal, and social abuses.”
Non-Argumentative	 there have been attempts to codify human rights internationally through agreements particularly the universal declaration of human rights signed in 1948.
Non-Argumentative	 this listed a large number of political, social and economic rights that are supposed to be universally held.
Non-Argumentative	 despite this there is no universally followed list of rights and there is the possibility that more human rights may over time become recognised or become necessary where there was not the need before.
Non-Argumentative	 internet access is an obvious example of this; the internet was only invented inand the world wide web in 1989.
Non-Argumentative	 as the internet has become a vital conduit for information only in the last decade it could not have been considered a human right only a few decades ago.
Non-Argumentative	just as there is no definitive list of human rights that is universally recognised what exactly the criteria for what a right into a human right is open for dispute.
Non-Argumentative	 the human rights reference handbook characterises them as being:several other features of human rights may also be added to these.
Non-Argumentative	 they are based upon the relationship between government and the people rather than two individuals, and the responsibility for these rights primarily falls upon the government.
Non-Argumentative	 they are minimal standards; what we cannot fall below rather than what we would like to have.
Non-Argumentative	 as they are universal they need to have strong justifications that can apply everywhere so that they can be recognised in all cultures.
Non-Argumentative	 this potentially provides a high threshold for considering a right to be a human right.
Non-Argumentative	internet access might be considered a human right in and of itself in which case there is a need for the concept of internet access to meet the above conditions; however it could equally be argued that internet access is already a human right as a part of human rights that already exist, particularly the freedom of expression.
Non-Argumentative	“a human right to internet access is an interesting concept that needs to be explored.
Non-Argumentative	 it directly relates to how we fulfil the first draft principle “we – all human beings – must be free and able to express ourselves, and to receive and impart information and ideas, regardless of frontiers.”
Non-Argumentative	 the internet is the greatest tool of communication invented so far.
Non-Argumentative	 it is however becoming much more than this but a separate social sphere in itself.
Non-Argumentative	 a human right to internet access may well be necessary to ensure everyone is able to interact in this sphere.”
Argumentative	 - alex helling access to the internet can be considered a separate human right in and of itself .
Argumentative	 the un special rapporteur in junepublished a report that implied that access to the internet is a human right `` the special rapporteur remains concerned that legitimate online expression is being criminalized in contravention of states ' international human rights obligations . ''
Argumentative	 the right to internet access can meet the necessary conditions to be a human right ; as a right is should be universal , everyone should have access not just a few .
Argumentative	 the internet is becoming much more than just a tool but is becoming a fundamental part of society creating a new sphere of interaction that everyone has a right to have access to .
Argumentative	 creating a right to internet access would be addressing a specific contemporary problem as with other human rights that are specific such as a right to basic schooling , enshrined in articleof the universal declaration of human rights .
Argumentative	 not having access to the internet is similar to not having basic schooling ; it considerably narrows people 's options and their horizons .
Argumentative	 as tim berners-lee , the founder of the world wide web , argues `` given the many ways the web is crucial to our lives and our work , disconnection is a form of deprivation of liberty . ''
Argumentative	 in our traditional human rights there is a hole when it comes to a right to receive and be able to seek out information .
Argumentative	 almost everyone would consider freedom of speech and freedom of expression to be human rights but these rights are not very effective if there is not a way for those who wish to access that information .
Argumentative	 michael l best contends that articleof the universal declaration of human rights on freedom of expression implies some symmetry but that freedom of authorship is privileged over freedom of readership .
Argumentative	 in short governments could allow freedom of expression while ensuring that those expressing dissenting views have a very minimal audience without breaking human rights .
Argumentative	 a right to the internet is the perfect human right to fill this gap .
Argumentative	 the internet is estimated to have overbillion web pages , and the most recent digital universe study estimates that 1.8 trillion gigabytes would be created in.
Argumentative	 the sheer size of the internet means that it is the ideal medium for providing this right to access information .
Argumentative	 the internet is also increasingly accessible to everyone making it possible to be considered universal ; it is no longer something that the poor can not hope to have access to .
Argumentative	 there are already over 2.1 billion people using the internet worldwide includingmillion in africa .
Argumentative	 freedom of expression and speech and freedom of information is a fundamental freedom and is articlein the universal declaration of human rights .
Argumentative	 this is usually taken to have three parts for governments to uphold : a duty to respect , for the government not to interfere with the freedom to impart information , a duty to protect , preventing interference with lawful communications and , a duty to fulfil , a duty to provide government held information .
Argumentative	 access to the internet falls within this .
Argumentative	 the duty to respect means that governments can not block access for people wishing to use the internet to express themselves .
Argumentative	 the duty to protect means government should prevent others from interfering with internet users and the duty to fulfil could easily be taken just a little bit further to having to provide access to the internet .
Argumentative	 freedom of expression therefore covers a freedom to access the internet as it already provides for a freedom to access mediums to express ones ' self .
