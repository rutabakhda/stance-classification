Non-Argumentative	during the cold war era, the united states vastly expanded its military capacity; today, the us military vastly outstrips any other military in the world.
Non-Argumentative	 for the majority of its existence, the american public has favored an isolationist outlook for foreign policy; during the lead-up to world war i, armaments manufacturers were referred to as “merchants of death.”
Non-Argumentative	 however, the public’s viewpoint dramatically shifted in the second half of the twentieth century due to the perceived threat of communism and nuclear war.
Non-Argumentative	 since the end of world war ii, the us military has intervened in many conflicts where its claims that the opposition posed a threat to us security have been somewhat dubious- these interventions vary significantly in their level of success.
Non-Argumentative	 in preparing for the debate, both sides will want to have a general understanding of the major incidences of us intervention in the post-wwii era.
Non-Argumentative	 interventions after the end of the cold war will of be greater significance because the us’s foreign policy shifted significantly at that time to adjust to a multi-polar world.
Non-Argumentative	debaters may wish to break the debate into two basic categories; morality and pragmatism.
Non-Argumentative	 on the first issue, debaters should consider whether us unilateral military force could be just.
Non-Argumentative	 within the category of pragmatism, debaters may further divide the debate into immediate effectiveness and possible alternatives.
Non-Argumentative	 effectiveness is paramount to the debate, but is a difficult area to evaluate because it is impossible to know what “would” have happened in any particular case if the us had not intervened.
Non-Argumentative	 consideration of possible alternatives (or lack thereof) is not essential to the debate, but can add substance to both sides.
Non-Argumentative	 while the pro may simply take a normative stance and argue that us hegemonic power is detrimental, it will be in a much stronger position if it can demonstrate that there is a preferable alternative.
Argumentative	 conversely, the opp may want to explain why there are no viable alternatives, and why the lack of alternative world police options justifies us military dominance.
Argumentative	the u.s. is an independent nation , not an international entity .
Argumentative	 thus% of the world population has no voice in its ' government 's decisions .
Argumentative	 the us government has authority over its own citizens , and it is justified in engaging in war if its citizens are under direct threat .
Argumentative	 however , citizens of other nations have no means of expressing their opinion in the us government .
Argumentative	 if the us government abuses its power , these people have no reliable legal means of recourse .
Argumentative	 consequently , the us government has no authority to intervene in their affairs .
Argumentative	 a government derives its sovereignty from a social contract with its citizens .
Argumentative	 citizens surrender some of their freedoms in exchange for government protection ; if a government does not serve its people 's best interests , it is not legitimate .
Argumentative	 thus in any situation where the interests of the american public are not aligned with those of the global population , the us military can not serve the international community without failing to meet its obligation to its own citizenry .
Argumentative	 because the american public has the ability to oust a leader that does not promote their interests , the military is much more likely to choose the option of serving american interests .
Argumentative	 this may not be unreasonable behavior , but it is indicative of the need for other entities - either other nations or international organizations - to have comparable military power to that of the united states .
Argumentative	 the us military makes problems worse just as often as it makes them better .
Argumentative	 the us intervened in vietnam on the grounds of protecting the free world from communism ; over 58,000 american soldiers and approximatelymillion vietnamese civilians were killed while the us failed to subdue the vietcong .
Argumentative	 the united states provided covert support to augusto pinochet after his military coup d’etat over chile 's democratically elected government under salvadore allende because the us feared allende , a socialist , would promote communism.
Argumentative	 , today , pinochet is remembered as a bloody dictator that ruled through terror foryears .
Argumentative	 us intervention in somalia in 1992-94 resulted in little more than the loss of american lives .
Argumentative	 the us experienced similarly negatively results during its intervention in beirut , 1982-84 , grenada  , libya  , and haiti  .
Argumentative	 more recently , the us has occupied iraq and afghanistan for nearly ten years without brining long-term stability to the region .
Argumentative	 the united states military needs to step down from its self-assumed role as world police officer because it is not effective and its failed attempts lead to huge civilian casualties .
Argumentative	 western domination is not the answer to political conflict ; it is the cause of many predicaments that result in the violation of human rights in countries in asia , africa , and the middle east today .
Argumentative	 former cia analyst michael scheuer , who led the hunt for osama bin laden , wrote in hisbook , imperial hubris , that `` , bin laden , could not have his current - and increasing - level of success if muslims did not believe their faith , brethren , resources , and lands to be under attack by the united states and , more generally , the west .
Argumentative	 indeed , the united states , and its policies and actions , are bin laden 's only indispensable allies . ''
Argumentative	 the united states ' unwavering support for israel and its dubious grounds for invading iraq are further source of anger in the arab world .
Argumentative	 the us justifies its military dominance by arguing that terrorist groups pose a serious threat to american society , and then this military dominance increases support for such terrorist groups .
Argumentative	 america can not act as the world police because such a system will never lead to peace .
Argumentative	 the united states spends approximately $trillion annually on its military ; china , the world 's second largest military spender , spends $trillion .
Argumentative	 the us outpaces other possible peacekeepers by such a large gap that these other powers have little incentive to even try to keep up .
Argumentative	 unilateral us intervention undermines international actors such as un troops because it communicates the us 's refusal to submit to the interests of the international community .
Argumentative	 thus us military intervention becomes a `` quick fix '' which prevents genuine long-term stability
