Non-Argumentative	detention on the grounds of mental health aims to provide treatment and safety for those who are deemed unable to make an informed decision about their situation due to their mental state.
Non-Argumentative	 the current process in the uk means that two doctors or a doctor and a social worker have to declare that it would be in the interest of the patient and society for the patient to be 'sectioned' (meaning detained in hospital).
Non-Argumentative	 this usually lasts forhours, but can be extended by the doctor for up todays (full details in scrapbook).
Non-Argumentative	 a similar process is carried out in countries such as australia, the usa (although the specifics vary between states) and the netherlands.
Non-Argumentative	 in other countries such as germany, detention is only carried out if a guardian wishes it.
Non-Argumentative	 yet historically, such a method of detention has been abused by governments such as soviet russia using these mental health laws to detain political prisoners1.
Non-Argumentative	 many mental health awareness groups oppose this policy.
Argumentative	 this aims to discuss the positive and negative aspects and effects of detention on the grounds of mental illness, with particular reference to dspd (dangerous severe personality disorder).
Argumentative	as a society we should put effort into helping those suffering from mental illness and detention is one way of being sure that they are receiving and maintain treatment .
Argumentative	 this also means that doctors are able to keep an eye on patients so that if the patient is no longer a risk , they can be let out .
Argumentative	 if patients are detained then doctors will have a better idea of their patient 's usual behaviour and therefore be better at reading their symptoms .
Argumentative	 the public is at risk from people with known dangerous mental health problems .
Argumentative	 two people are killed every month by care in the community patients in the uk , care in the community described in scrapbook .
Argumentative	 jonathan zito was stabbed to death by christopher clunis in; jason mitchell beheaded his father and strangled two pensioners in; stephen laudat killed his grandfather in, believing him to be the gang leader ronnie kray ; john rous stabbed care worker jonathan newby to death in; michael stone killed lin and megan russell in a field near their home in.
Argumentative	 all of these killers had diagnosed mental illnesses but could not be detained under uk law , yet if they had been detained many lives would have been saved .
Argumentative	 currently , people with mental health problems who have not committed an offence may only be detained for the purposes of treatment , and may avoid treatment if they can argue that they will receive no benefit from it .
Argumentative	 there is no known effective treatment for dangerous severe personality disorder , dspd .
Argumentative	 this means that people with dspd fall through a gap between the criminal justice system and the healthcare system -- they can not be treated , so they never get less dangerous , but they can not be detained , so the public can not be protected from them .
Argumentative	 furthermore it seems it is not unreasonable to detain people who you have good grounds to suspect could be dangerous as we already detain potentially dangerous people who do not have mental health problems anyway , if authorities believe they may be terrorists .
Argumentative	 people who are mentally ill are significantly more of a danger to themselves than to others with only% of homicides being committed by people with mental illness .1 detention is one way of preventing people suffering from mental illness to harm themselves or anyone else , and this must be in the best interest of the patient .
Argumentative	 some people who are mentally unwell may attempt to commit suicide or get caught up in a cycle of self deprecating thoughts .
Argumentative	 however , patients in detention can be monitored ; therefore similarly to the issue of argument one , it seems important to detain patients in order to save them from themselves .
Argumentative	 thebritish mental health act1 was actually created partly in order to update the mental health actso that it conforms to current human rights law .
Argumentative	 the process of sectioning ensures this by having two separate doctors diagnose the patient as both mentally ill and a threat to themselves or others ; these diagnoses are then presented to an independent amp , approved medical practitioner , who makes the decision about whether or not the individual can be detained .
Argumentative	 if a doctor or amp believes this should be extended todays , then the process is repeated again independently .
Argumentative	 therefore they should be no concerns about these detentions violating anyone 's human rights .
