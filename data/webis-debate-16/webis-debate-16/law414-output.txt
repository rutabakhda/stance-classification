Non-Argumentative	when individuals are convicted of a criminal offence, the sentencers (judges of magistrates) have many options for sentencing.
Non-Argumentative	 these may include prison sentences (known as custodial sentences) which are considered to be ‘reserved for the most serious offences’ where a fine or a community sentence cannot be ‘justified for the offence’, or where the court believes that the offence is so serious that the public need to be protected from the offender.
Non-Argumentative	 non-custodial sentences are offered for less severe crimes, and may include fines or community sentences, which include volunteer work, curfews, behavioural management courses, education and training or drug rehabilitation.
Non-Argumentative	 in 2008, 890,296 offenders in the uk received a fine while 190,171 offenders were given a community sentence.
Non-Argumentative	 however, 9,734 offenders were given an absolute discharge which meant that they received no punishment for their offences.
Non-Argumentative	 in america, sentencing guidelines vary by state; notably, some states allow capital punishment while others do not.
Non-Argumentative	 while sentencing guidelines may vary between states, and between countries, many countries are currently facing a common problem: that the prison systems are overburdened.
Non-Argumentative	this has brought discussion over whether sentencers rely too heavily on prisons as a form of justice.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk, the ministry of justice announced that the number of inmates in prisons exceeded the ‘operational capacity’, with inmates being held in police or court cells to try and ease the pressure on the overburdened prison system.
Non-Argumentative	 the total number of inmates was 8,000 higher than the number which the prison service assessed would comprise a ‘good, decent standard of accommodation’.
Non-Argumentative	 there have also been serious questions about whether offenders are receiving the most appropriate punishment for them, or whether prison has become a blanket form of punishment.
Non-Argumentative	 one possible divide where we could draw a line between those who serve prison sentences and those who serve other forms of sentencing is between violence and non-violent offences.
Non-Argumentative	 violent offences might comprise crimes such as murder, manslaughter, rape, assault, terrorism, domestic violence and armed robbery, as opposed to non-violent offences like theft, burglary, fraud, white-collar crime or drug offences.
Non-Argumentative	           the mechanism for this debate is fairly simple; that violent offenders who pose a serious safety risk to the public and those around them will be imprisoned, but those who commit non-violent crimes will instead receive alternative forms of punishment.
Non-Argumentative	 these alternative punishment will probably follow the standards already set up, but you may wish to argue that they will be increased – for example, fines will be increased, community service hours will be longer, education or training programmes will be more vigorous and so on.
Argumentative	 it is practically unfeasible for the government to continue imprisoning people at this rate when prisons are already over capacity .
Argumentative	 sooner or later , we will have to accept that there is too great a burden on our prison facilities for this kind of sentencing to continue being used in so many cases .
Argumentative	 as such , we should give priority to imprisoning criminals who are genuinely dangerous and who have proved their violent tendencies already .
Argumentative	 these kinds of offences are the most traumatic for victims and we owe it to them to make sure that these criminals are physically distanced from the rest of society .
Argumentative	 however , while non-violent offenders have also committed a crime , they do not pose the same kind of danger which requires that they must be locked up ; in fact , those who commit small-scale crimes against society could be better rehabilitated by being forced to work to improve society through things like community service -- they will be less likely to damage a society which they feel a part of and have helped to build .
Argumentative	 when people hold a greater stake in their community , they value it more and are reluctant to damage it .
Argumentative	 those who advocate prison sentences for non-violent offenders often state two points : first , that the idea of being sent to prison is thought to act as a deterrent , and prevent people from committing crimes ; second , that people have do commit crimes and go to prison are less likely to re-offend .
Argumentative	 this is false on both counts .
Argumentative	 the idea of prison as a deterrent is immediately disproved by a rising violent crime rate , and the argument that these prisoners will not re-offend is disproved by the high rate of re-offending after a prison sentence , reaching up to% for some prisons .
Argumentative	 moreover , re-offending statistics are normally only based on crimes committed within a year of release ; there may be many , many more ex-prisoners who re-offend who are not recorded within these statistics .
Argumentative	 crimes which are committed impulsively and without forethought are rarely deterred by the possibility of punishment or being caught .
Argumentative	 however , non-custodial methods , such as electronic tagging , have shown promise in reducing recidivism rates .
Argumentative	 where prison has failed in deterring crimes , alternative forms of punishment have an opportunity to deter initial crime and lower rates of recidivism .
Argumentative	 sentencers have a wide array of options in their sentencing , and indeed the sentencing council states that sentencing should ` never be a rigid , mechanistic or scientific process ' .
Argumentative	 they have the option to make sentences more proportional to the crimes committed , and it is logical that the more serious crimes should receive the most serious sentences -- in this case , imprisonment .
Argumentative	 other options for sentencing could include fines , unpaid work , rehabilitation programmes , alcohol or drug treatments , curfews and supervision requirements .
Argumentative	 one key aim of sentencing is to convey moral censure , and to encourage offenders to truly consider the implications of their actions .
Argumentative	 however , offenders who feel that they have been punished too severely or treated unfairly , or that those who have committed worse crimes receive the same sentence , are less likely to respond to that moral message and benefit from it .
Argumentative	 this subsequently damages a key pillar of the criminal justice system -- the idea of rehabilitation .
Argumentative	 criminals who see themselves as unfairly treated by society have no reason not to strike out against society again by committing another crime .
Argumentative	 not only would alternative forms of punishment prevent this from happening , but it does not require the availability of prison and so is less of a burden on resources .
Argumentative	 heavier fines , longer community sentences and more strict curfews can easily be given as an appropriate sentence for non-violent offenders .
Argumentative	 merely having a criminal record which states that an individual was imprisoned , rather than given a more productive sentence such as community service , can have enormous implications on that individual 's future employment opportunities .
Argumentative	 this is particularly pertinent if it is a first offence , committed in a moment of stupidity .
Argumentative	 prisons are an isolating factor which separates the offender from their friends and family and distances them even further from the rest of society .
Argumentative	 this creates a ` cycle of crime ' where the offender 's closest acquaintances are those who they met in prison , rather than a supportive network of family and friends who can help this person to be reintegrated into society .
Argumentative	 not only does prison allow prisoners to share criminal ideas , but it may also reciprocally validate their illegal actions by creating a sense of camaraderie .
Argumentative	 this makes rehabilitation , and recognition of society 's moral values , much more difficult .
Argumentative	 ultimately , using prison for non-violent offences only introduces the offenders to more serious crimes , and makes it more difficult for the offenders themselves to be reintegrated , and for wider society to reintegrate them .
