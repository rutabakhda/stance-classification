Non-Argumentative	for the last forty years the european union has been pursuing a large scale social project involving the integration and harmonisation of the bureaucracies and economic, social and foreign policies of europe’s sovereign states.
Non-Argumentative	 the eu’s predecessor, the european coal and steel union was created to control economic competition between france and germany.
Non-Argumentative	attempts to control the market for coal and steel, by manipulating prices and driving up rates of production had traditionally been a flashpoint for conflict between france and germany.
Non-Argumentative	 it was believed that by placing the coal and steel industries of both nations under the control of an impartial, supranational body, conflict of this type could be avoided.
Non-Argumentative	 the coal and steel community would ensure that both nations could use their raw materials reserves to fuel economic growth and development, rather than arms manufacturing and warfare.
Non-Argumentative	 an independent court was set up to adjudicate in disputes (primarily to do with economic and export policy) between the community’s states.
Non-Argumentative	the adoption of the euro was intended to move this process of integration closer to completion.
Non-Argumentative	 it was argued that if the eu were to adopt a single currency, with a fixed exchange rate, movement of capital and labour through the eu’s economy would be made more efficient.
Non-Argumentative	 fluctuations in the value of individual currencies, and the difficulties inherent in converting reserves of one currency into another would be removed.
Non-Argumentative	 it would also reduce some of the risk inherent in investing in foreign states.
Non-Argumentative	 investing money in a state that operates its own currency exposes lenders to the possibility that economic turmoil in the state may cause the value of the currency to collapse, the value of its imports to rise or the value of its exports to fall.
Non-Argumentative	 however, if the state is part of a currency union, with the value of its scrip controlled centrally and dependent on the economic performance of a wide range of industries within a plurality of states, an isolated economic crisis is not likely to cause the currency to devalue.
Non-Argumentative	free movement of goods, labour, capital and services have improved the quality of life within eu member states immeasurably.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover, the creation of bodies such as the european court of justice and centrally coordinated national competition watchdogs has done much to foster dialog and reduce economic conflict within europe.
Non-Argumentative	 the rights of individual eu citizens have been enhanced by the creation of harmonised anti-discrimination and equal pay laws.
Non-Argumentative	 all of these advances stand to be lost if europe does not resolve the political differences that have made the euro such a contentious issue and such a difficult-to-manage currency.
Non-Argumentative	while the overall aim of “an ever closer union” between european states is laudable, many commentators believe that unification of the currencies of many of the eu’s members was a mistake.
Non-Argumentative	 ultimately, currency unions fail because of entrenched and unresolved economic and political differences between the states that sign up to them.
Non-Argumentative	 the political and economic cultures of europe are still so diverse that an effective union of european currencies- that is, the eurozone- has always been perceived as controversial.
Non-Argumentative	 following the adoption of the euro by the “eurozone” states, control over the currency’s value and supply, along with interest rates for overnight lending to european banks was handed over to a central body, the european central bank.
Non-Argumentative	 eurozone states lost the ability to set and control central bank interest rates within their borders.
Non-Argumentative	 now that the relatively high value of the euro is preventing weaker european economies from stimulating demand for their export products, many economists are arguing the eurozone members should be free to pursue different approaches to fostering stability and productivity at different times.
Non-Argumentative	several of the key terms that will be used in this debate require further definition.
Non-Argumentative	monetary policy describes the measures taken to control a state’s economy by altering the supply of money available to banks, businesses and individuals.
Non-Argumentative	 monetary policy may attempt to suppress inflation by altering the interest rate at which banks borrow money from the state.
Non-Argumentative	 the state may attempt to enhance its competitiveness within export markets by creating fresh quantities of currency, reducing the overall value of that currency.
Non-Argumentative	eurozone members have effectively surrendered control over their monetary policy by adopting the euro.
Non-Argumentative	 the european central bank has responsibility for determining the interest rates and quantitative supply of the euro.
Non-Argumentative	 individual members of the euro cannot determine its interest rate within their own borders.
Non-Argumentative	 they cannot suppress the value of euros that they hold.
Non-Argumentative	fiscal policy describes actions taken by a government with the objective of directly stimulating a state’s economy.
Non-Argumentative	 by contrast, monetary policy alters the supply of cash within an economy in order to alter the behaviour of economic actors, creating economic stability indirectly.
Non-Argumentative	 fiscal policy requires a government to involve itself intimately with an economy.
Non-Argumentative	 a government will either take money directly from its citizens, in the form of taxation, or will spend money that it is holding in reserve.
Non-Argumentative	 government expenditure will usually take the form of public works projects, increased healthcare and education funding, domestic stimulus packages (such as the car replacement schemes run by the uk and us government during 2008-2009) and investment in business.
Non-Argumentative	eurozone members retain control over their fiscal policy because, subject to the limitations imposed by membership of the eu, they still have authority to set taxation rates within their own borders, and to decide how much of the government’s budget will be spent on education, social welfare and investment.
Non-Argumentative	many eurozone states have neglected the revenue generating aspects of fiscal policy.
Non-Argumentative	 financial problems encountered by nations such as greece have been exacerbated by low tax rates and inefficient methods of tax collection.
Non-Argumentative	austerity is primarily used to decrease a state’s budget deficit and to provide it with more revenue with which to service other debts.
Non-Argumentative	 reductions in public services and reductions in individuals’ incomes caused by tax rises often result in significant social unrest.
Non-Argumentative	austerity may also involve liberalisation of state’s economy.
Non-Argumentative	 national industries may be privatised and collective bargaining mechanisms (such as unions) may be dismantled.
Argumentative	 monetary policy and fiscal policy must be used in tandem if they are to be effective .
Argumentative	 moreover , monetary policy and fiscal policy are tools that should only be wielded by politicians and bankers with an in-depth understanding of the economy that they are attempting to control .
Argumentative	 the core problem with the eurozone is the belief that the business cycles of its various member states are so closely aligned that they can all be controlled by the same body .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , this premise contradicts one of the most beneficial effects of the european single market -- economic specialisation .
Argumentative	 different types of market and different economies grow and contract in different ways .
Argumentative	 contraction in the housing or heavy industry markets may not happen at the same time as contraction in the software market .
Argumentative	 at the same time as the collapse of the us housing bubble increated substantial disruption in the financial services market , the market for mineral extraction machinery and services was booming , largely thanks to chinese demand .
Argumentative	 consequently , some states may experience an economic downturn at a time when others remain stable and productive .
Argumentative	 thus , the euro harms individual eurozone economies , by restricting their ability to respond to changes in the markets in which they are most heavily involved .
Argumentative	 this , in turn , increases the likelihood that they will undergo recessions or encounter unmanageable commodity price or asset price inflation .
Argumentative	 trust in the ecb is likely to dip in states that experience downturns of this type ; public confidence in the wider european project may falter .
Argumentative	 one of the eu 's broadest objectives is to foster growth and development within its member states .
Argumentative	 expansion of the eu to include poorer east european and baltic states was prompted partly by this aspirational goal -- and by the large , low cost labour markets that those states contained .
Argumentative	 public faith in the concept of european integration , and participation in the institutions of the eu is therefore closely tied to the economic opportunities that it can provide .
Argumentative	 such a distorted allocation of resources will inevitably damage the faith of many member states ' populations in the integration narrative that the eu promotes .
Argumentative	 from the perspective of an impoverished latvian farmer , or a semi-skilled polish labourer , spending money on ineffective bailouts of the greek and irish economies will seem unjust .
Argumentative	 the complicated justifications and factionalism underlying attempts to strengthen economies weakened by adoption of the euro obstructs the integration narrative and makes its core message - that europe is working and wants to share its prosperity - seem deeply hypocritical .
Argumentative	 cynicism or hostility toward an integrated europe has correlated strongly with a rise in xenophobic nationalism in many eu states .
Argumentative	 the german popular press continues to propagate stereotypes of the greek nation as dysfunctional , workshy and profligate ; far right and anti-immigration political parties have polled strongly in slovakia , england , poland and the baltic states .
Argumentative	 since, the nationalist sinn fein party has gained substantial influence in the irish parliament .
Argumentative	 if bailout schemes are allowed to continue , the creation and redistribution of wealth within the eu will come to be seen as a sham .
Argumentative	 poorer eurozone economies have not been exposed to risky investments and bubble events that have endangered their weaker neighbours , but they still require - and expect - intensive investment and assistance from the eu .
Argumentative	 the popular perception of german-led bailouts is that good money is being thrown after bad -- the bailouts are seen as threatening the eu 's development and assistance budgets .
Argumentative	 the core political message that the eu has been seeking to promote is at risk of being compromised by financial mismanagement .
Argumentative	 in such an environment , resentment of the eu is likely to build , lending authority to the isolationist and xenophobic discourses of nationalist politicians .
