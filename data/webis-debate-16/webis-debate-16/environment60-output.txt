Non-Argumentative	the seychelles are an archipelago in the indian ocean, northeast of madagascar.
Non-Argumentative	 it is one of the smallest countries in the world at onlykm2, its population is also comparatively small at only 90,000.
Non-Argumentative	 many of the islands that make up the country are flat reefs, though not all – its highest point is 905m above sea level.
Non-Argumentative	 as with many other small island states around the world, particularly maldives, kiribati, and tuvalu the whole country is under threat from climate change.
Non-Argumentative	 unlike tuvalu and kiribati the problem is not simply sea level rise meaning the whole country could end up underwater; unlike those island states the country does have some higher ground.
Non-Argumentative	 instead the problem is that the remaining land will become uninhabitable.
Non-Argumentative	 there is some sea level rise, but the problem is as much about erosion as a result of more intense storms, and higher and stronger tides.
Non-Argumentative	percent of the population lives on the coast but moving into the higher areas is not an option as the country would be left with few resources and almost no fresh water supply.
Non-Argumentative	so far no country has ceased to exist as a result of climate change.
Non-Argumentative	 yet it has become increasingly clear that climate change talks are not going to result in deep and fast enough cuts in emissions to prevent some sea level rise so the position of the small island states will increasingly become untenable as their islands become uninhabitable.
Non-Argumentative	 the search is therefore on for solutions.
Non-Argumentative	 the most obvious scenario is that these states will simple cease to exist and their people will become climate refugees.
Non-Argumentative	 there have been some immense estimates that there could bemillion climate refugees by– but even if this were to happen the vast majority would be internal refugees, and not members of a disappearing state.
Non-Argumentative	 thus there may well be 20million refugees as a result of parts of bangladesh being underwater but bangladesh would still exist – those refugees would still have other areas of the country where they could go.
Non-Argumentative	 the citizens of the small island states would be in a different situation as the nation they are citizens of would no longer exist; instead they would probably have to be taken in by neighbours although this might prove problematic because the refugee convention does not cover victims of natural disasters.
Non-Argumentative	traditionally the four elements of statehood are having a defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.
Non-Argumentative	 climate change threatens to damage the defined territory to the point that the second is no longer possible.
Non-Argumentative	 this in turn is likely to jeopardise an effective government.
Non-Argumentative	 only the last criterion is not initially under threat.
Non-Argumentative	 so how might a state maintain these criteria when its defined territory is disappearing?
Non-Argumentative	 the proposal would be that the seychelles should buy, or otherwise acquire, territory from another bigger state.
Non-Argumentative	 this state would cede some, or all, sovereignty over this territory.
Non-Argumentative	 the territory would probably be a similar size or possibly if less economically viable slightly bigger than the current territory.
Non-Argumentative	 ideally the ceded territory would be islands or coastal so that the current skills of the people of the seychelles are still relevant.
Non-Argumentative	 given the small size of the state it is likely uninhabited land could be found.
Non-Argumentative	 however any current inhabitants would be allowed to remain, with the possibility that their current state might maintain sovereignty over them.
Non-Argumentative	n.b. the arguments here could be used for any small state that is going to no longer exist as a result of climate change.
Non-Argumentative	allowing the current natives to remain, and for the possibility of contiguous sovereignty by two states over the same territory, opens up a lot of questions that have not been sufficiently explored here.
Non-Argumentative	 the alternative that they be expelled, citizenship, or essentially become migrants however would make any deal much less likely to be acceptable.
Argumentative	 it is clear that if the seychelles wishes to remain as a sovereign nation it will have to relocate almost all of its population and it makes sense for this to be in one place so keeping the nation together .
Argumentative	 the way to do this is through purchasing land and sovereignty from another country that has land to spare .
Argumentative	 there is clearly little other choice and some of the small island states have already accepted this .
Argumentative	 kiribati for example has already bought land from fiji with the intent of using it as a last resort for its people .
Argumentative	 the seychelles , as with the other nations whose very existence is threatened by climate change , is small .
Argumentative	 it is twice the size of washington d.c. , so smaller than many cities .
Argumentative	 as such finding enough land to relocate the country should not be a problem .
Argumentative	 several of the states closest to the seychelles ; kenya , tanzania , somalia , and madagascar , have plenty of land that they could give up without any inconvenience to their own state .
Argumentative	 kenya , the smallest , is more thantimes bigger than seychelles .
Argumentative	 if there are no countries willing to cede complete sovereignty over territory then some kind of shared sovereignty could be considered .
Argumentative	 `` this conferred jurisdiction must include rights to become a citizen , migrate , work , access health care , and access social security . ''
Argumentative	 additionally there would almost certainly need to be sovereignty over justice , law and order .
Argumentative	 however this would potentially leave large areas of sovereignty in the remit of the host nation ; such as providing defense .
Argumentative	 the most notable compromise by both might be to maintain sovereignty over people rather than just territory .
Argumentative	 there have been suggestions such as by krasner that shared sovereignty should be considered , and become much more normal .
Argumentative	 and some forms of shared sovereignty have happened before such as foreign control over some tax revenues , or the status of forces agreements the usa had with germany that restricted german ability to make war after wwii .
Argumentative	 or more obviously the members of the eu increasingly cede some sovereignty to the international entity .
Argumentative	 as the deal would be voluntary for both the seychelles and its host country and both would potentially gain such a deal would seem feasible .
Argumentative	 the president of vanuatu has noted `` if such a tragedy , the disappearance of a state , should happen , then the united nations and its members will have failed in their first and most basic duty to a member and its innocent people , as stated in articleof the charter of the united nations . ''
Argumentative	 as long ago asdeveloped nations accepted `` the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit to sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command '' and that `` polluter should , in principle , bear the cost of pollution '' .
Argumentative	 there is also a convention on the reduction of statelessness in which articledemands that any redrawing of borders must not render a person stateless , the principle behind which would equally apply to a disappearing state .
Argumentative	 the small island states are losing their countries through no fault of their own it is therefore the responsibility of other states to provide them with alternatives ; be this land or the resources to purchase land .
