Non-Argumentative	qatar was the surprise winners in decemberof fifa’s vote to determine the hosts for theworld cup beating out competition from the united states, south korea, japan, and australia.
Non-Argumentative	 in recent months, a lot of concerns have been raised about the temperatures in qatar in summer, when the cup is scheduled to take place.
Non-Argumentative	 fears that searing summer temperatures of more than 40c could pose a risk to the health of players and supporters convinced a lot of sporting officials to try and move the world cup in winter, when the heat dips to an average of 20c.
Non-Argumentative	 if this were to happen it would be for the first time inyears that the tournament has not been held in the summer.
Non-Argumentative	 qatari officials state that they are more than prepared to install air conditioning systems in the stadiums, but this may not be enough to make the games an enjoyable experience for the thousands of fans.
Argumentative	 in order to fully understand the implications of this motion , one must see what participating in the fifa world cup means to a football player .
Argumentative	 first of all , it means an intense and sustained physical effort for a significant amount of time .
Argumentative	 do not forget that the cup itself lasts for a couple of weeks , and there are plenty of weeks of training before it in order to get the players in the best shape possible .
Argumentative	 this means they are exposed to a lot of physical stress and have to play or train no matter of the weather conditions or temperature .
Argumentative	 secondly , with temperatures ranging from 35c to 40c during the summer it would be torture to force the players to train and play in those conditions .
Argumentative	 former france , fulham , manchester united and everton striker louis saha told bbc sport he thought it was impossible for players to handle the middle eastern country 's extremely high summer temperatures .
Argumentative	  `` i was in qatar recently and it was 48c , '' he said .
Argumentative	 `` believe me , it is impossible to have a proper game down there . ''
Argumentative	 it is not only the players who get hurt , but also the game itself , as you can not expect the same show from fatigued , light-headed and exhausted players .
Argumentative	 most of all , fifa 's top priority should always be the protection of player 's health , as , at the end of the day , despite money , show or spectators , no one should risk their life or be obliged to work in unsafe conditions .
Argumentative	 studies show the immense risks of heat-related illnesses and their potentially deadly outcome .
Argumentative	  being aware of these issues , fifa 's vice-president jim boyce , from northern ireland , is prepared to back a decision in principle to move the world cup to the winter .
Argumentative	  one of the most important parts of the game is the fans .
Argumentative	 they are the ones who watch the sport , they are the ones to which football owes its popularity .
Argumentative	 not only are they the ones who pay for the sport they are also a vital part of any competition .
Argumentative	 without the choreographies made by the supporters and the impressive cheering , football becomes nothing more than a silent , mediocre sport .
Argumentative	 as a result , we must take into consideration how well these hundreds of thousands of supporters from all over the world who will come to qatar feel during the world cup .
Argumentative	 let us not forget , that they will spend most of the time outside the stadia ; on the streets , in the gruelling heat , or they will be forced indoors .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , for many of them this experience will be overshadowed by the constant heat-caused discomfort when engaging in the kind of socialising and watching matches at outdoor screens that usually creates the atmosphere of the cup .
Argumentative	 it is even more worrying when you take into consideration the fact that supporters of all ages and health conditions come here , some of them will be exposing themselves to heat related risks .
Argumentative	 heatstroke can potentially cause death .
Argumentative	 taking this into consideration , uefa 'smember associations have already backed a switch , while europe 's leading clubs have said they are `` open '' to the possibility of a winter world cup in qatar .
Argumentative	  theworld cup in qatar must switch to winter , according to fifa 's own medical chief .
Argumentative	 michel d'hooghe , the chairman of the fifa 's medical committee , will advise that the risks posed to supporters by extreme heat are too great .
Argumentative	 `` i am sure the qataris have the technical skill to organise a tournament where teams could play and train in a stable , acceptable temperature , but it 's about the fans .
Argumentative	 they will need to travel from venue to venue and i think it 's not a good idea for them to do that in temperatures of 47c or more . ''
Argumentative	  there a lot of advantages for you as a country if you are selected to organize a world cup , a european cup or any kind of major sport event .
Argumentative	 they range from fame and international recognition to money and influence in the administrative bodies .
Argumentative	 therefore , it is in qatar 's interest that this event goes as smoothly as possible in order to prove its organizing capabilities and thus allowing them to increase its chance for hosting any kind of future sporting event .
Argumentative	 by hosting the event in summer , qatar is exposing itself a lot of unnecessary risk -- and probable bad publicity .
Argumentative	 the most obvious is someone getting injured or even worse , dying during the world cup .
Argumentative	 this would be extremely problematic especially if we are talking about a football player participating in the event .
Argumentative	 it would not only stain qatar 's image because it happened during the world cup organized there , but it would also destroy any credibility that it has as an organiser of events after so many assurances that the heat will not be a problem .
Argumentative	 moreover if the cup were to be held in winter , some of the billions that would be used to build such complex systems of air conditioning could be used to serve other purposes .
Argumentative	 the qataris could invest it in better publicity , more social campaigns such as discouraging racism in sports or many other areas .
Argumentative	 in that way , not only they would receive the recognition for being the organizers of the world cup , but they would get extra credit from the international community for being involved in the social benefits of sports for example .
Argumentative	 in conclusion , the qataris do have the administrative support for a change of schedule , as even sepp blatter , fifa 's president has recognised `` after many discussions , deliberations and critical review of the entire matter , i came to the conclusion that playing the world cup in the heat of qatar 's summer was simply not a responsible thing to do '' and they should take advantage of this situation .
