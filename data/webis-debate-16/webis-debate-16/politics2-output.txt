Non-Argumentative	labour, together with the conservatives one of the two parties that dominate uk politics, is traditionally a left of centre party but has, since the mid 1990s been a centrist party rebranded as ‘new labour’.
Non-Argumentative	 the labour party has however lost the last two elections; inunder gordon brown, and inwhen the leader was ed miliband.
Non-Argumentative	 with ed miliband having resigned after his party’s poor performance at the general election labour engaged in a leadership contest through the summer of 2015.
Non-Argumentative	 jeremy corbyn got onto the ballot with the help of labour mps who wanted to increase the bredth of the debate in the contest rather than leaving it between three centerists.
Non-Argumentative	 however benefitting from a change in the election rules that gives the membership much more say – limiting that of mps and unions – saw a surge in support for corbyn who eventually won with 59.5% of the vote.
Non-Argumentative	so what does being left wing actually mean anyway?
Non-Argumentative	 generally it means being radical, reforming and socialist.
Non-Argumentative	 it can be, and often is, progressive.
Non-Argumentative	 in economic terms it usually means more state control (on behalf of the people) of the economy with it traditionally meaning complete nationalisation.
Non-Argumentative	 and in social political terms it means more equality and power to the people rather than elites.
Non-Argumentative	since the consensus for the last couple of decades has been that more state control over the economy is a bad thing having someone who is in favour of it in charge of a major party is potentially a big change.
Non-Argumentative	 it leads to the question of whether moving to the left is good either for labour or for the country.
Argumentative	 the original values of the labour party were `` the common ownership of the means of production , distribution , and exchange '' and even today the labour party aims to `` serve the public interest '' as well as to create `` a just society , which judges its strength by the condition of the weak as much as the strong '' , `` an open democracy , in which government is held to account by the people '' , and `` a healthy environment '' .
Argumentative	 in the last parliament labour supported there being a cap on welfare spending .
Argumentative	 more recently labour abstained on a conservative welfare bill that many felt was too harsh in its cuts .
Argumentative	 corbyn , and a move to the left , will bring labour back to its core values rather than supporting conservative policies and austerity that harms individuals .
Argumentative	 since the start of the 1990s labour has moved to the right to contest the ` centre ground ' of politics .
Argumentative	 this worked inwhen the conservatives were a spent force afteryears in power .
Argumentative	 tony blair successfully stole the conservatives moderate policies .
Argumentative	 however this has resulted in the centre ground moving to the right with policies such as austerity and welfare cuts becoming a consensus .
Argumentative	 labour needs to move left to fight on their own ground forcing other parties to match their more populist policies such as renationalising the railways .
Argumentative	 corbyn in his last campaign rally argued `` fundamentally many people are turned off by a political process when the major parties are not saying anything different enough about how we run the economy '' .
Argumentative	 this lack of choice has been a complaint by voters for years -- ever since tony blair made new labour electable by moving to the centre .
Argumentative	 jeremy corbyn now gives the electorate a real choice compared to the conservative party ; tackling the deficit through tax rises , rather than cutting spending , nationalising the railways , peoples quantitaive easing , do n't replace trident , and rent controls .
Argumentative	 the public `` are totally turned off by a style of politics which seems to rely on the levels of club house theatrical abuse that you can throw across at each other in parliament and across the airwaves . ''
Argumentative	 this style is necessary to extentuate the small areas where there are differences between the parties .
Argumentative	 introduce real differences on the big issues of government , particularly the economy and society , then such minor point scoring fades into insignificance .
