Non-Argumentative	 allowing women to play against men in the same sporting leagues has been a debate almost since the start of professional sporting leagues.
Non-Argumentative	 the issue is whether there can be no competition between men and women due to men’s superior physical strength and about letting women compete into men’s leagues (not necessarily merging the two) as a solution to gender discrimination.
Non-Argumentative	  as sports competitions are getting bigger, richer, and more televised and accessible, this debate is of crucial importance as it could transform the face of almost every sporting competition.
Non-Argumentative	 now, in the majority of sports there is a separation between sexes, but lately there has been a growing number of female athletes requested that they would be allowed to play in men’s leagues.
Argumentative	 there are a few examples of females being allowed in men’s leagues such as the example of danica patrick, a nascar driver, and annika sorenstam who played golf against men at the p.g.a. tournament in 2003, but there are only two olympic sports which allow the two sexes compete head-to-head: equestrian and sailing.
Argumentative	in sports it is crucial that the best person wins no matter of his or her sex .
Argumentative	 we should let the women decide if they are prepared enough to participate in men 's events , and not take that decision for them by forcing them into set leagues .
Argumentative	 american skier lindsey vonn has won the women 's world cup four times .
Argumentative	 in november, she asked to be allowed to compete in the men 's event .
Argumentative	 the request was denied  .
Argumentative	 if a female athlete can perform better than a male athlete in a certain discipline , she should be allowed to compete with , and beat , the male athlete .
Argumentative	 the examples of danica patrick , a `` nascar driver who won theindy japanand finished 3rd in theindy'' and seena hogan who holds multiple records in ultra cycling , which have n't been beaten by any man or women to this day  , show us how women can improve a competition in a significant way .
Argumentative	 at the end of the day , it does n't matter who wins , the very purpose of sports forces us to let them take the decision , as we can not accurately suppose that women are worse than men at every single competition of every single sporting event as shown by the stated examples .
Argumentative	 assuming we would have two equally muscular and equally fast male and female athletes , the current system clearly discriminates the female athlete by not allowing her to compete in the male league .
Argumentative	 it is against the very nature of sports to treat differently two athletes who have the same strength , speed , agility , dexterity , mental focus , determination , ambition based purely on their type of chromosomes .
Argumentative	 this is extremely important as most of the time the women 's competition gets less attention from the public and sponsors , as seen in the cases of women 's national basketball association and national women 's football association .
Argumentative	 so , by forcing them to stay in those leagues , you are denying potentially successful athletes fame , pride and money .
Argumentative	 the giro rosa , one of the biggest women cycling competition , offers a prize money ofeuros , which is a mere thousandth of the tour de france 's 450,000 euro top prize .
Argumentative	  one of the best ways to have a healthy life , avoid obesity and learn crucial values like respect , teamwork and fair play is by practicing a sport .
Argumentative	 in order to incentivize women from around the world to get involved you need to give them role models ; women who receive a lot of media coverage to whom they can look up to .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , women 's sports do n't receive as much media coverage as men 's sports because they are considered to be less spectacular and thrilling .
Argumentative	 by allowing certain women , who have the necessary skills to compete against men to get this coverage you will give young girls the necessary motivation to start practicing sports , thus bringing a massive social benefit to the society .
Argumentative	 this happens already to successful women who are lucky enough to compete with men , as shown by danica patrick , so why should we stop here ?
