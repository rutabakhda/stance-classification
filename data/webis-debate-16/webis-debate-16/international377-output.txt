Non-Argumentative	first and foremost, it is necessary to give a clear definition of the concept of civil society.
Non-Argumentative	 it can be understood as ‘the population of groups formed for collective purposes primarily outside of the state and marketplace’ (van rooy, 1998: 30).
Non-Argumentative	 such groups are based on solidarity networks, and on ‘cross-cut vertical ties of kinship and patronage’ (lewis, 2002: 570).
Non-Argumentative	the importance of civil society, and the role it should play in countries’ political life, are widely debated issues.
Non-Argumentative	 some scholars such as mcfaul go as far as to argue that democracy can never come into being without an active civil society.
Non-Argumentative	 others, while recognizing its importance, argue that civil society alone cannot bring about actual changes in the country’s political life, without a decision on the part of the elites.
Non-Argumentative	 indeed, it can be argued that an excessively active civil society is dangerous for political stability.
Non-Argumentative	 besides democracy, the development and involvement of civil society in the political life is often seen as beneficial for economic development.
Non-Argumentative	the issue, however, remains controversial.
Non-Argumentative	 many underline that the idea of civil society’s involvement being positive for political life has been developed in the context of a western-centric literature.
Non-Argumentative	 indeed, the concept itself of civil society has its roots in western european experiences.
Non-Argumentative	 furthermore, as highlighted before, scholars do not even agree that csos play a positive role in western contexts.
Non-Argumentative	 the purpose of this debate is to understand how the concept of civil society adapts to the african context, and specify the pros and cons of a wider involvement of societal actors in african political life.
Non-Argumentative	  are there african specificities that justify a limited involvement of civil society in the political life?
Non-Argumentative	 or, on the contrary, should we consider the western example and advocate for a wider participation of societal actors in politics?
Argumentative	 the involvement of civil society in political life is all the more crucial in africa , where newborn democracies need to be strengthened and consolidated .
Argumentative	 active csos function as a watchdog for political power and as alternative channels for citizens ' political participation , thus strengthening democratic accountability .
Argumentative	 indeed , several scholars highlight that a ` prostrate civil society ' is to be identified as a fundamental factor in determining the region 's democratic instability , scott  as quoted in lewis ,:.
Argumentative	 ` civil society is a hitherto , missing key , to sustained political reform , legitimate states and governments , improved governance , viable state-society and state-economy relations , and prevention of the kind of political decay that undermined new african governments a generation ago ' , harberson ,: 1-2 .
Argumentative	 the sustainability of african democracies thus depends on the promotion of a more active and participative civil society .
Argumentative	 there is increasing evidence that a more active and involved civil society is good for economic development .
Argumentative	 specifically , csos are believed to have a crucial role for african development prospects .
Argumentative	 the local economic development network of africa argues that ` in particular , they often know what are the employment and income generation needs of different groups within the population and what could stimulate better outcomes for them .
Argumentative	 it is very important , therefore , that they are involved and consulted '  .
Argumentative	 in addition csos autonomously implement development programmes .
Argumentative	 only to give an example , in nepal csos in the education for income generation program have played a crucial role in building up workers skills resulting in% being in employment many striking out entrepreneurially on their own5 .
Argumentative	 it is therefore necessary for african governments to guarantee such organizations and grant them a wider participation .
Argumentative	 former un secretary-general kofi annan has stated that ` good governance is perhaps the single most important factor in eradicating poverty and promoting development ' .
Argumentative	 it is therefore impossible to ignore the claim that csos involvement in political life is crucial to promote good governance practices .
Argumentative	 civil society is able to create additional pressure on the government to ensure good governance , as well as to contribute ideas about what good governance practices should entail in the specific local context , and to ` bridge the gap between the law and its actual implementation '  .
Argumentative	 `` good governance in africa is ultimately going to come from civil society in the countries themselves '' , declared jendayi frazer , former u.s. assistant secretary of state for african affairs .
Argumentative	 an article in the guardian shows how cso 's can help : ` in the ileje district of southern tanzania , expectant mothers about to give birth had to cross a crocodile-infested river into malawi because a local medical centre did not have enough money to pay for a midwife .
Argumentative	 it took a campaign by civil society organisations and citizens to uncover that there was money available , but that it had somehow been diverted ' .
Argumentative	 csos involvement ultimately permitted the solution of the issue .
