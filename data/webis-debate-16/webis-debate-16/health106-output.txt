Non-Argumentative	a generic drug is "a drug product that is comparable to brand/reference listed drug product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality and performance characteristics, and intended use"1.
Non-Argumentative	 india, brazil, thailand, south africa and even smaller african countries such as zambia, ghana, tanzania, uganda and zimbabwe produce generic drugs2.
Non-Argumentative	 the production of generic drugs is a controversial issue due to the existence of patent protections on most pharmaceutical products that current law considers to be the property of the firms that produced them.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents of generic drugs point out the extremely high prices charged for brand name drugs as compared to generics when they are permitted, as well as the needs of the developing world for cheap drugs in their battle with various life-threatening diseases as reasons to circumvent conventional patent law and to permit the production of generics generally.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents of generic drugs hold that the patent rights are essential in order to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new and better drugs and that generic drugs are potentially harmful.
Argumentative	 debates center around the issues of the inviolability of patents, the needs of the developing world for drugs and how best to meet them, and whether generic drugs can be a suitable and cheaper alternative to conventional brand name drugs.
Argumentative	the current drug patent regime is largely designed to benefit and shield the profits of large pharmaceutical companies .
Argumentative	 this is due to the fact that most of the laws on drug patents were written by lobbyists and voted upon by politicians in the pay of those firms .
Argumentative	 the pharmaceutical industry is simply massive and has one of the most powerful lobbies in most democratic states , particularly the united states .
Argumentative	 the laws are orchestrated to contain special loopholes , which these firms can exploit in order to maximize profits at the expense of the taxpayer and of justice .
Argumentative	 for example , through a process called `` evergreening '' , drug firms essentially re-patent drugs when they near expiration by patenting certain compounds or variations of the drug1 .
Argumentative	 this can extend the life of some patents indefinitely ensuring firms can milk customers at monopoly prices long after any possible costs of research or discovery are recouped .
Argumentative	 a harm that arises from this is the enervating effect that patents can generate in firms .
Argumentative	 when the incentive is to simply rest on one 's patents , waiting for them to expire before doing anything else , societal progress is slowed .
Argumentative	 in the absence of such patents , firms are necessarily forced to keep innovating to stay ahead , to keep looking for profitable products and ideas .
Argumentative	 the free flow of ideas generated by the abolition of drug patents will invigorate economic dynamism .
Argumentative	 many developing countries are fraught with terrible disease .
Argumentative	 much of africa and asia are devastated by malaria , and in many parts of africa aids is a horrendous scourge , infecting large percentages of many countries populations .
Argumentative	 for example , in swaziland ,% of the adult population is infected with the virus1 .
Argumentative	 in light of these obscenely high infection rates , african governments have sought to find means of acquiring enough drugs to treat their ailing populations .
Argumentative	 the producers of the major aids medications do donate substantial amounts of drugs to stricken countries , yet at the same time they charge ruinously high prices for that which they do sell , leading to serious shortages in countries that can not afford them .
Argumentative	 the denial of the right to produce or acquire generic drugs is effectively a death sentence to people in these countries .
Argumentative	 with generic drugs freely available on the market , the access to such drugs would be facilitated far more readily and cheaply ; prices would be pushed down to market levels and african governments would be able to stand a chance of providing the requisite care to their people2 .
Argumentative	 under the current system attempts by governments to access generic drugs can be met by denials of free treatments , leading to even further suffering .
Argumentative	 there is no ethical justification to allow pharmaceutical companies to charge artificially high prices for drugs that save lives .
Argumentative	 furthermore , many firms that develop and patent drugs do not share them , nor do they act upon them themselves due to their unprofitability .
Argumentative	 this has been the case with various treatments for malaria , which affects the developing world almost exclusively , thus limiting the market to customers with little money to pay for the drugs3 .
Argumentative	 the result is patents and viable treatments sitting on shelves , effectively gathering dust within company records , when they could be used to save lives .
Argumentative	 but when there is no profit there is no production .
Argumentative	 allowing the production of generic drugs is to allow justice to be done in the developing world , saving lives and ending human suffering .
Argumentative	 the sale of generic drugs invariably reduces costs to consumers .
Argumentative	 this is due to two reasons .
Argumentative	 it may be the case that an individual or firm with a patent , essentially a monopoly right to the production of something , may not have the ability to efficiently go about meeting demand for it .
Argumentative	 patents slow , or even stop the dissemination of the production methods , especially when a patent-holder is unwilling to license production to others1 .
Argumentative	 such an outcome is deleterious to society , as with no restrictions on drug production an efficient producer , or producers , will emerge to meet the needs of the public , producing an amount of drugs commensurate with demand , and thus equilibrating market price with that demand2 .
Argumentative	 this market equilibration is impossible under conventional patent laws , as it is in the interest of firms to withhold production and to engage in monopolist rent-seeking from consumers3 .
Argumentative	 this leads firms to deliberately under-produce , which they have been shown to do in many cases , as for example the case of miacalcic , a drug used to treat paget 's disease , in which its producer deliberately kept production down in order to keep prices high4 .
Argumentative	 when a firm is given monopoly power over a drug it has the ability to abuse it , and history shows that is what they are wont to do .
Argumentative	 by allowing the production of generic drugs , this monopoly power is broken and people can get the drugs they need at costs that are not marked far above their free market value .
Argumentative	 patent regimes cause firms to inefficiently allocate resources .
Argumentative	 one such inefficiency arises from the duplication of effort by firms seeking to develop the same or very similar drugs , though only the first to do so may profit from it due to the winner-takes-all patent system .
Argumentative	 this leads to brutal races and excessive expenditure of resources to be first over the line and to monopolize the production , at least for a time .
Argumentative	 these races can thus lead to efforts by firms to steal research from one another , thus resulting in further wastes of resources in engaging and attempting to prevent corporate espionage .
Argumentative	 another serious inefficiency arises in the production of similar products to existing ones , seeking to get around existing patents .
Argumentative	 such has been the case for years in the pharmaceutical industry , which has succeeded , for example , in curing erectile dysfunction dozens of times .
Argumentative	 an overemphasis on such spinning off of similar products is the result of patent-generated inefficiency.
Argumentative	 the inefficiency does not end with production , however , as firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecuting offenders , all of which generates huge costs and little or no return.
Argumentative	 furthermore , the deterrent effect to patent piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal .
Argumentative	 clearly , in the absence of patent protection for pharmaceuticals , markets and firms will behave more efficiently .
Argumentative	 this is shown by the introduction of generic antiretroviral drugs for treating aids where the introduction of generic drugs forced the price of the branded drugs down from $to $in september/october3 .
Argumentative	 an individual 's idea , so long as it rests solely in his mind or is kept safely hidden , belongs to him .
Argumentative	 when he disseminates it to everyone and makes it public , it becomes part of the public domain , and belongs to anyone who can use it .
Argumentative	 if individuals or firms want to keep something a secret , like a production method , then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product .
Argumentative	 one should not , however , expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one has , since no such ownership right exists1 .
Argumentative	 no one can own an idea .
Argumentative	 thus recognizing something like a property right over something like a drug formula is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their asset .
Argumentative	 physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards .
Argumentative	 ideas do not share this right to protection , because an idea , once spoken , enters the public domain and belongs to everyone .
Argumentative	 this should apply all the more with vital drugs that are fundamentally for the public good by improving health .
