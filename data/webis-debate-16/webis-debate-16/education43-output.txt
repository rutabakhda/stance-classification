Non-Argumentative	creationism, often rebranded as intelligent design, is the belief that intelligent agency was involved in the creation and development of life on earth.
Non-Argumentative	 the view purports to be a science and to be deserving of consideration not only by the scientific community, but also students.
Non-Argumentative	 for this reason creationists have been involved in raising public awareness about the flaws they see in evolution, and have created major controversies, and it has become a particular issue in the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 in britain, schools must teach evolution as part of the national curriculum, but are not barred from teaching creationism as well, and some religious schools, such as emmanuel college in gateshead, have done so, presenting creationism as fact and evolution as a matter of faith.
Non-Argumentative	 in the usa, pressure has been put on school boards to enforce the teaching of creationism and evolution as equally controversial scientific theories (as in ohio), or to remove evolution from the list of examination topics and therefore make it less likely to be taught (as in kansas).
Non-Argumentative	 while creationists have found mixed success in the furtherance of their views on the political stage they have met with far stauncher and more unified opposition from the scientific community, which has largely denounced creationism as religion in the borrowed clothes of science.
Non-Argumentative	 the controversy remains in spite of this denunciation.
Non-Argumentative	 debates on teaching creationism in school revolve around the questions of whether creationism can be considered a legitimate scientific position, and whether it stands up to empirical scrutiny.
Non-Argumentative	important note: in any debate regarding evolution, abiogenesis, and creationism, it is important to work out from the start what is under discussion.
Non-Argumentative	 creationists in particular use ambiguity to their advantage in debates.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, if the debate is on evolution, should he feel cornered, a creationist will often try to turn the conversation to the question of the origin of life, or of the planet.
Non-Argumentative	 sometimes they will go so far as to ask for an explanation of the beginning of the universe.
Non-Argumentative	 while all these do have scientific explanations, they have nothing whatsoever to do with evolution.
Non-Argumentative	 debates should always be kept on topic or else they have a strong tendency to get very messy indeed.
Non-Argumentative	 useful definitions.
Non-Argumentative	- scientific theory: "a systematic ideational structure of broad scope, conceived by the human imagination, that encompasses a family of empirical (experiential) laws regarding regularities existing in objects and events, both observed and posited.
Non-Argumentative	 a scientific theory is a structure suggested by these laws and is devised to explain them in a scientifically rational manner."
Non-Argumentative	-evolution: "the biological theory that animals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations."
Non-Argumentative	-abiogenesis: "the field of science dedicated to studying how life might have arisen for the first time on the primordial young earth."
Argumentative	 many scientists do not accept the conclusions of the evolutionists .
Argumentative	 people like dr. michael behe have dedicated themselves to exposing the flaws in evolution and showing that there is very real disagreement within the scientific community .
Argumentative	 this controversy is highlighted in the many court cases , books , and televised debates occurring in countries all over the world .
Argumentative	 children deserve to hear about the controversy , and not to simply be fed one story set for them by the prevailing majority in the scientific community , even if that community can not claim anything near consensus .
Argumentative	 until consensus is reached and indisputable proof of one theory or the other given , both sides should be taught in schools .
Argumentative	 the opinion of the scientific community with regard to facts and theories has a great propensity to change with time .
Argumentative	 once scientists adamantly maintained that the earth was flat .
Argumentative	 for centuries it also maintained that there were two kinds of blood flowing through the human body .
Argumentative	 science is not infallible and the prevailing theory is no more than the opinion currently in vogue among scholars .
Argumentative	 in light of new evidence , theories can change over time , giving way to better explanations .
Argumentative	 for this reason , the evolutionists ' dogmatic adherence to their position in spite of contrary evidence provided by creationists is hard to understand .
Argumentative	 however , it becomes clear why the scientific establishment takes such a confrontational position toward creationism when one considers that many eminent scientists and researchers have built their careers within the paradigm of evolution , and their research often depends wholly on its acceptance .
Argumentative	 these scientists would lose their exalted position in the light of a paradigm-shift in scientific understanding away from evolution .
Argumentative	 it is for this reason that scientists who adhere to established norms so often fight things like creationism , even though they provide explanations where evolution can not .
Argumentative	 for science to progress , these conservative impulses must be fought against , which is why it is essential that when science is taught , so are all the prevailing theories concerning branches of the sciences , including creationism .
Argumentative	 nature is marked by clear design .
Argumentative	 the complexity of the human body , of ecosystems , and even of bacteria , attests to the existence of creative agency .
Argumentative	 it is impossible that such things as , for example , interdependent species could come to exist without the guidance of a designer .
Argumentative	 likewise , certain organisms can be shown to be irreducibly complex , meaning that if one were to remove any part of it , it would lose all functionality .
Argumentative	 this refutes the gradualist argument of evolution , since there is no selective pressure on the organism to change when it is functionless .
Argumentative	 for example , the bacterial flagellum , the `` motor '' that powers bacterial cells , loses all functionality if a single component is removed .
Argumentative	 besides design , the only explanation of its development is blind chance , which is nonsensical .
Argumentative	 creationism serves to explain the various mysteries of biology currently absent from the evolutionary biologists ' picture of the world .
Argumentative	 the existence of complexity of the order found in the natural world is too great to envisage an origin other than complex design .
Argumentative	 creationism can be drawn as an entirely reasonable scientific hypothesis , and it forms a coherent theory of the origin and development of life that opposes the naturalist theories of abiogenesis and evolution .
Argumentative	 abiogenesis describes the development of life from nonliving materials and evolution seeks to explain the development and diversity of life through a gradual process of mutation and natural selection , yet no one has ever demonstrated either process sufficiently in the laboratory .
Argumentative	 in the case of abiogenesis , all experiments to create an environment similar to the supposed prebiotic soup whence life first sprang have resulted in no new life forming .
Argumentative	 in the case of evolution , evolutionists consistently fail to show the development of new kinds of organisms .
Argumentative	 while there is no doubt that some change occurs within species , such as the breeding of wolves into dogs , it appears to happen only within certain limited bounds .
Argumentative	 certainly no experiment or study has shown evolution to be capable of explaining such huge diversity in the world of living things .
Argumentative	 creationism , on the other hand , offers the explanation that abiogenesis and evolution can not .
Argumentative	 the diversity of life and its origin are rationally explicable as the product of intelligent agency .
Argumentative	 this is not a statement of religious belief , but of scientific observation .
Argumentative	 describing the nature of the designer , however , is another question all together , one that need not be answered in order to accept that there is such a designer .
Argumentative	 society is made up of communities with their own views on politics , religion , education , etc, school boards should be able to set curriculum based on the desires of the public , not just on what the scientific elites command to be taught .
Argumentative	 children deserve to hear that their beliefs and those of their community are respected in the classroom .
Argumentative	 this is why creationism , a belief held to varying extents in many countries , should be taught in the classroom .
Argumentative	 this is particularly true in the united states , where in several states the majority of people does not accept evolution , but have instead adopted creationism , considering the evidence for the latter to be more convincing .
Argumentative	 in a poll ina majority ,% , said that creationism should be taught in schools either without evolution or alongside it .
Argumentative	 the teaching of creationism should not be taught exclusively , but should share time with other prevailing theories , particularly those of evolution and abiogenesis .
Argumentative	 furthermore , evolution taught exclusively threatens religious belief , telling children they are no more than animals and lack the spark of grace given by god .
Argumentative	 it is important for social stability that schools are allowed to teach what communities believe to be true .
