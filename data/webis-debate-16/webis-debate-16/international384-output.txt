Non-Argumentative	the first thing to note here is that we are not considering a broad brush treaty on internet governance that covers all sorts of questions such as who creates domain names as such an agreement would be very difficult to hammer out as shown by the failure at the international telecommunications union in 2012.
Non-Argumentative	 instead this would be a treaty purely between governments and limited to cybersecurity; as it is a national security issue it is clearly a governmental issue.
Non-Argumentative	what are cyber-attacks?
Non-Argumentative	 this could potentially mean the use of cyberspace in war but that is not what we are going to debate; the chances of states adhering to such an international treaty in a war situation would seem to be slim and it would be of little use the rest of the time.
Non-Argumentative	 instead we are talking about the multitude of attacks that are launched every day.
Non-Argumentative	 the ban would most clearly apply to state actors but for convenience sake it might be best to consider it outlawing all cyber attacks and placing the burden on each state to tackle it as a domestic law enforcement issue.
Non-Argumentative	andrea renda of the centre for european policy studies suggests:this would simply mean putting these into treaty form.
Non-Argumentative	 note this debate directly follows on from a previous debatabase debate on whether sanctions could be used as a response to cyber-attacks and covers many of the same issues.
Argumentative	 conflict needs to be regulated , and something that can start conflicts even more so .
Argumentative	 warfare and conflict is currently regulated by the geneva conventions that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict and regulate the conduct of the involved actors .
Argumentative	 just as importantly there are rules on what weapons can be used through various treaties that ban weapons such as the land mine ban , and on when a state can legally initiate conflict through the un charter .
Argumentative	 in just the same way when a new area of potential conflict arises that too must be regulated by treaty .
Argumentative	 the internet and the threat of cyber-conflict is that new area at the moment .
Argumentative	 while cyber warfare is not currently a large scale threat it is still a form of conflict that could escalate just like any other - the pentagon has explicitly stated it could respond militarily to a cyber-attack .
Argumentative	 as a result it is most sensible to draw up the rules and regulations early , to ensure everyone knows the consequences and prevent damage by making sure that states agree not to engage in offence cyber-attacks against each other .
Argumentative	 once a treaty is set up to limit or eliminate cyber-attacks monitoring is unlikely to be a problem because states will be willing to monitor each other .
Argumentative	 states in order to defend themselves from cyber-attacks already monitor the cyber-attacks that occur -- the united states for example already has several cyber defense forces .
Argumentative	 if that is not enough then there are numerous private groups that will be monitoring cyber-attacks as most are made against corporate rather than government targets .
Argumentative	 for example private company mandiant exposed a unit of the people 's liberation army for its cyber-attacks in february.
Argumentative	 once a cyber-attack has been traced and evidence gathered if the appropriate domestic authorities wo n't deal with the culprit then an independent international institution can decide on the punishment for the government that is not living up to its treaty commitments .
Argumentative	 if there is a need for international monitoring rather than simply a dispute settlement mechanism then there are models available through current treaties ; a un organisation similar to the international atomic energy agency or international criminal court could be set up that can investigate incidents when asked .
Argumentative	 ever since the state rose to ascendancy over powerful internal actors , such as the nobility in a feudal system , the state has had a monopoly on the use of force .
Argumentative	 the state quickly became the only institution with the resources to maintain military forces and has become the only legitimate wielder of force .
Argumentative	 the internet however changes this .
Argumentative	 cyber-attacks are often by individuals or groups who can carry out a cross border attack without the aid of their home country .
Argumentative	 incia director leon panetta told congress `` when it comes to national security , i think this represents the battleground for the future .
Argumentative	 i 've often said that i think the potential for the next pearl harbor could very well be a cyber-attack . ''
Argumentative	 if cyber-attacks are so important it stands to reason that the groups who are able to engage in such activities should be as limited as possible .
Argumentative	 while it is not always possible states try to make sure that the weapons of war for the most part remain in the hands of responsible actors .
Argumentative	 this should apply as much in cyberspace as elsewhere .
Argumentative	 while terrorist groups do exist -- and are occasionally armed by states -- for the most part they are seen by every government as being illegitimate .
Argumentative	 a treaty that bans , or sharply curtails cyber-attacks would benefit every state .
Argumentative	 even those who may currently benefit from cyber espionage would be better off signing up to the treaty .
Argumentative	 first most cyber-attacks are not carried out by the state even in countries like china where the state is using the internet as an offensive tool .
Argumentative	 in its annual report to congress the department of defence stated some cyber-attacks `` appear to be attributable directly to the chinese government and military '' but this does not sound like a majority .
Argumentative	 secondly no state wants a risk of conflict as a result of an unregulated new field of potential conflict .
Argumentative	 or even to risk relations with other nations ; cyber-attacks in large part go on because they are cost free .
Argumentative	 and finally all nations are the victims of cyber-attacks .
Argumentative	 the united states has repeatedly condemned cyber-attacks against it but china also claims that it is the victim of cyber-attacks .
Argumentative	 china 's minister of national defense general chang wanquan says `` china is one of the primary victims of hacker attacks in the world . ''
Argumentative	 having a treaty against cyber attacks would not only make business easier for all countries but it would build up trust between nations where it is currently being eroded .
