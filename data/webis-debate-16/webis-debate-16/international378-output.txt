Non-Argumentative	african nations played a key role in the genesis of the international criminal court – indeed, the first state to ratify the rome statute was senegal.
Non-Argumentative	  five icc judges, including the vice president, sanji mmasenono monageng (who is from botswana), are african, as is the current prosecutor, fatou bensouda (from the gambia).
Non-Argumentative	however, a chorus of disapproval has grown from members of the african union (a grouping of the vast majority of african states) following a number of controversial indictments of african leaders.
Non-Argumentative	 omar al bashir, president of sudan is indicted by the icc for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, but has not been captured for trial despite visiting a number of icc member states, including some african states who have simply refused to hand him over.
Non-Argumentative	 more recently, things came to a head over the icc’s actions against the sitting president and vice president of kenya, uhuru kenyatta and william ruto, over allegations of crimes against humanity in violence that followed on from the disputedpresidential election.
Non-Argumentative	the idea of an african criminal court is not new, and was first mooted in 2004.
Non-Argumentative	 in 2012, it was planned that the african court of justice and african court on human and people’s rights , two courts run by the african union that not all states have signed up to and have a low case load, merge in to one court which would also try criminal cases.
Non-Argumentative	 however, few countries have signed or ratified the appropriate treaties and the courts being merged get little, if any, use.
Non-Argumentative	 this has not yet materialized.
Non-Argumentative	a regional criminal court could cover either the three varieties of crime covered by the icc – genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity – or a broader pool, possibly including drug trafficking, coups and/or  corruption.
Argumentative	 all of the ongoing icc prosecutions are based on events in africa , and all those on trial are africans .
Argumentative	 the icc has not brought actions following the invasion of iraq , or the conflicts in sri lanka and colombia .
Argumentative	 the lack of action in any matter outside sub-saharan africa shows that the international community are happy to allow the icc to exclusively prosecute africans .
Argumentative	 the un security council , which contains no african permanent members , can veto any possible prosecution and refer a case to the icc , replacing the icc with an african criminal court would stop this bias , or perception of bias .
Argumentative	 this would be done by withdrawing from the rome statute and the icc which has been labelled as western imperialism by people such as rwandan president paul kagame .
Argumentative	 a regional court would be a good way to balance the competing issues between the legitimate concerns of the african states and the international criminal court .
Argumentative	 it would be able to provide an african solution to african problems , with no accusations of external interference or colonialism .
Argumentative	 similarly , it would have some of the advantages of the icc particularly its independence from individual states , meaning those in high places are more likely to be held to account .
Argumentative	 with this accountability to an african court there would be an impression of being held to account by peers not outsiders .
Argumentative	 the balance between peace and justice is a complex issue .
Argumentative	 the icc has disregarded peace as a priority in cases , focusing exclusively on justice by indicting individuals , which reduces the diplomatic leeway and drives those indicted towards a bunker mentality .
Argumentative	 the result then may be the conflict goes on longer and more crimes are committed .
Argumentative	 peace and preventing future crimes should come before justice for past crimes .
Argumentative	 the icc have focused on prosecuting omar al bashir , but it may be a better option to focus on diplomatic alternatives to trials for dealing with the conflict in darfur .
Argumentative	 it has been suggested that offences such as `` unconstitutional change of government '' , drug trafficking , piracy and corruption should be added to the jurisdiction of an african criminal court .
Argumentative	 the icc is limited to only a small number of crimes .
Argumentative	 however , an african criminal court could not only deal with the existing crimes , but create pan-african solutions in terms of dealing with a number of issues where africa needs particular solutions .
Argumentative	 an acc could deal with piracy off the coast of east africa , where there is no effective court system , due to somalia amounting to a failed state .
Argumentative	 similarly , `` unconstitutional change of government '' prosecutions could amount to a deterrent to coups .
