Non-Argumentative	africa has been plagued by conflict in the second half of the 20th century and the start of the 21st.
Non-Argumentative	 65% of states in sub-saharan africa have experienced an armed conflict since independence with the number of conflicts rising from only one into a height of eighteen inbefore falling back to single figures.
Non-Argumentative	 this may be exaggerated as the data set counts conflicts as where there werebattle deaths in a year – a very low threshold.
Non-Argumentative	 but while some of these conflicts may have been very small, africa has also had its share of the most horrific conflicts since the second world war, most notably the congolese civil war which up tohad caused an estimated 3.5million deaths, and the rwandan genocide (not always considered a conflict) that may well have killed up to 800,000 people.
Non-Argumentative	despite (or perhaps because of) this history, the 50th anniversary solemn declaration by the african union (au) indeclared “we pledge not to bequeath the burden of conflicts to the next generation of africans and undertake to end all wars in africa by 2020”.
Non-Argumentative	 ending all wars is a high minded principle and a desire to do so is regularly espoused by politicians but is it actually achievable in africa – and by the ambitious date of 2020?
Argumentative	 the solemn declaration did not just highlight the goal but also that it would be achieved through three techniques : by, addressing the causes of conflicts -- economic and social disparities , strengthening judicial systems to ensure accountability , and reaffirming collective responsibility  preventing emerging sources of conflict such as piracy getting a foothold , and, engaging in conflict prevention .
Argumentative	 africa has been building the african peace and security architecture to address these causes of conflict .
Argumentative	 it has created the peace and security council that facilitates the au 's response to crises ; it can engage in actions from humanitarian assistance to military intervention if there are particularly grave circumstances such as genocide .
Argumentative	 when it does authorise action , this action is coordinated by the au commission .
Argumentative	 when it comes to peaceful resolution of conflict , the au has a ` panel of the wise ' made up of former presidents and others with lots of influence and moral authority who use preventative diplomacy to try to resolve conflicts .
Argumentative	 conflict in africa is slowly being ended .
Argumentative	 inthere wereconflicts in africa ; bythis had been halved to.
Argumentative	 but a decline in the number of conflicts is not the only positive trend in african conflicts : there has also been a decline in the size of wars .
Argumentative	 they have changed from wars between two organised armies to being small scale insurgencies .
Argumentative	 inthe conflicts were on average causing more than 20,000 battle deaths per year , but byonly around 1,000 .
Argumentative	 even the number of incidents of genocide and mass killing has been going down fromin the 1980s to five in the 2000s .
Argumentative	 ending war might therefore be considered to be ambitious but it is not against the trend and not inconceivable .
Argumentative	 the african union has been taking a much more active stance in preventing and resolving conflict .
Argumentative	 sinceresponsibility for peace in africa has been with the peace and security council .
Argumentative	 this body has authorised au interventions in somalia , sudan , burundi , and the central african republic .
Argumentative	 the african union is not the only organisation engaged in peacekeeping ; the economic community of west african states , ecowas , has also been actively engaged in peacekeeping , having been deployed in numerous conflicts since the 1990s , most recently in mali where they took part alongside french forces in defeating an islamist insurgency .
Argumentative	 the au is also boosting its collective capacity to respond to crises creating the african standby force made up of five regional brigades ofsoldiers .
Argumentative	 this force , when complete , will enable rapid deployment anywhere in africa so helping to prevent crises becoming full scale wars .
Argumentative	 what is war ?
Argumentative	 the au 's declaration does not define it .
Argumentative	 ending all conflict is ambitious , ending only inter state war in africa on the other hand is not .
Argumentative	 the vast majority of conflicts in africa have been internal .
Argumentative	 the only true inter state conflicts have been the wars between israel and egypt , the eritrean-ethiopian war , the uganda-tunisia war , and the second congo war .
Argumentative	 none of these are ongoing .
Argumentative	 the only conflicts that might count as inter-state that might be considered ongoing are the situation in western sahara and border clashes between the sudans .
Argumentative	 western sahara might be considered to be frozen with very few deaths as a result of it and the sudan conflict is in large part a result of the border being new .
