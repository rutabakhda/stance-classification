Non-Argumentative	(assange himself prefers the title “publisher and editor-in-chief who organises and directs other journalists”.)
Non-Argumentative	julian assange is a journalist, and should be treated as such.
Non-Argumentative	 the current debate rests on an archaic definition of the journalist and the news organisation, which has not adapted to the age of citizen journalists, tweets, leaks, links and re-posts.
Non-Argumentative	 we should expand our concept of what makes a “journalist” – and thus, who can take shelter under the umbrella of “media”.
Non-Argumentative	 we may need to interrogate the lines between “speaker’, “disseminator”, “source” and “reporter” of knowledge.
Non-Argumentative	otherwise, we risk obstructing the new media’s use of government sources.
Non-Argumentative	 and we risk applying the law in a lopsided fashion.
Non-Argumentative	 consider this: if we agree to prosecute assange – for endangering national security by leaking confidential government information – should we not also prosecute the editors of the new york times, der spiegel and the other traditional news outlets that re-published wikileaks material?
Non-Argumentative	on the other hand, we could draw the very valid conclusion that these flagship newspapers are already bound by editorial guidelines, ethics standards and professional journalism practices: like verification, fact-checking, placing in context, and anonymising names of those in danger.
Non-Argumentative	 in other words, these newspapers act professionally – and it is that which earns them the kinds of protection extended to other professional groups, such as lawyers and doctors.
Non-Argumentative	 if wikileaks does not act in accordance with journalistic standards, should it be able to seek refuge under journalistic privileges?
Argumentative	- katie engelhartfew industries have been changed more radically by the advent of the internet than journalism .
Argumentative	 the traditional role of the journalist , disseminating information to which they had special or privileged access , has changed beyond recognition .
Argumentative	 now readers and viewers have direct access to much of that information and can access it at their own convenience and through their own choice of media .
Argumentative	 sales of newspapers are in freefall and the stranglehold of a handful of broadcasters on political access has been lost forever .
Argumentative	 there are still extraordinary journalists finding news and genuinely affecting the society around them .
Argumentative	 for the most part , however , journalists increasingly comment on the news rather than directly collecting it .
Argumentative	 in many ways , assange has taken journalism back to basics -- acquiring information to which most people do not have access and making it public .
Argumentative	 the very fact that the powerful and the privileged dislike what he is doing so much could even be taken to suggest that he has to be doing something right as one of the roles of the fourth estate is to act as a check on government .
Argumentative	 at a time when much of the traditional media seems to have lost its sense of what its role is , wikileaks is providing a timely reminder .
Argumentative	 we know that most governments struggle with the idea of not having control over information and are suspicious of the media .
Argumentative	 in a pre-internet age working with a handful of proprietors made controlling information far easier .
Argumentative	 since the creation of the internet , the idea of controlling the media has become harder , now there are those who can broadcast themselves directly ; a mass of information and opinion that does n't rely on the patronage of publishers or political favour .
Argumentative	 assange has simply taken a journalistic position that makes sense for the new media age .
Argumentative	 in contrast to the opinion driven mainstream press and much of the blogosphere , wikileaks actually breaks new stories .
Argumentative	 new media requires new skills and attitudes of its journalists because the relationship with their readers has changed dramatically but the core of the role , speaking truth to power , remains the same .
Argumentative	 furthermore they do so in such a way as allows them to publish their source material and allow the reader themselves to make a judgement as to whether their story really reflects that material .
Argumentative	 this ability , reflecting effectively limitless capacity for providing textual information , meets the frequently heard desire for news without spin -- routinely featured in research into people 's views on the press .
Argumentative	 this may be a new approach , just as assange is a new type of journalist but he is still a journalist .
Argumentative	 one of the things that the leveson inquiry has made all too apparent is that simply working for a newspaper or broadcaster is not a satisfactory definition of journalist .
Argumentative	 in terms of maintaining a professional ethic , the difference between those who hacked into phones -- including that of murdered schoolgirl millie dowler -- and the journalists who broke the story , nick davies and amelia hill could not be starker .
Argumentative	 equally many popular blogs that focus exclusively on opinion or areas of news far more specialist than has traditionally been considered the role of the daily media .
Argumentative	 a more useful definition , it would seem , relates more to the ethics and aims of the individual or organisation involved .
Argumentative	 this has the advantage of ruling out those organisations devoted to advertising , such as listings magazines or shopping channels , or those focused purely on entertainment .
Argumentative	 a journalist should therefore have a commitment to revealing and disseminating information that is held by those with power to those over whom they wield that power .
Argumentative	 this means that the journalist gains access to information through various sources and then publicises that information as a story .
Argumentative	 anonymous sources such as those used by assange are a key part of journalism with many of the biggest stories such as watergate only being published because of anonymity .
Argumentative	 by such a definition , assange would clearly qualify .
Argumentative	 this was clearly felt to be the case by the new york times , the guardian , le monde and others who reprinted his original material and drew conclusions from it .
Argumentative	 it would come as something of a surprise to such publications to discover they were not staffed by journalists .
