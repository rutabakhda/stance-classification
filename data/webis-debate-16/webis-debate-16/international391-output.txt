Non-Argumentative	the european union (eu) currently hasmember countries, twelve of which have joined since the new millennium.
Non-Argumentative	 since this large expansion further expansion, with the exception of debates over turkey, has been a much smaller issue.
Non-Argumentative	 the european union has offered the prospect of membership in the eu to nine countries; albania, bosnia and herzegovina, croatia, former yugoslav republic of (fyro) macedonia, iceland, kosovo, montenegro, serbia, and turkey.
Non-Argumentative	 of these five, croatia, fyro macedonia, iceland, montenegro, and turkey, have been granted official candidate status.
Non-Argumentative	 however negotiations have only opened with croatia, iceland and turkey.
Non-Argumentative	however the european union itself is in crisis.
Non-Argumentative	 since the financial crisis inthe periphery of europe has been running in to financial problems.
Non-Argumentative	 greece, ireland and portugal within the core group in the euro single currency have been bailed out and there are still worries that much larger economies like spain or italy may at some point also need a bailout.
Non-Argumentative	 already there have been other eu states that are non-members of the euro that have also been bailed out such as hungary which was bailed out by the eu and international monetary fund in 2008.
Non-Argumentative	 as a result europe has little money or time left over for considering further expansion, does it really want to be expanding when there is crisis at home?
Non-Argumentative	none the less the question of expansion of the european union remains important in the long term.
Non-Argumentative	 many european countries have declining populations or soon will have so new workers are needed.
Non-Argumentative	 expansion is at the heart of the european project – there has always been a drive to either make europe deeper or broader.
Non-Argumentative	 the criteria for membership are simple and would eventually allow for quite a lot more expansion eastwards.
Non-Argumentative	 articleof the treaty on european union makes the eus founding principles “of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law” the main criteria along with being a european country.
Non-Argumentative	 this was reaffirmed and expanded upon in the copenhagen criteria ofthat required a candidate to have1, stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities;2, a functioning market economy, as well as the ability to cope with the pressure of competition and the market forces at work inside the union;3, the ability to assume the obligations of membership, in particular adherence to the objectives of political, economic and monetary union.
Argumentative	once states have passed these criteria then they need to go through an accession process in which the candidate country implements eu legislation and puts eu rules and procedures in place.
Argumentative	it is right to extend the economic and political benefits enjoyed by existing eu members to the rest of europe .
Argumentative	 states in eastern europe are still recovering from the `` dead hand '' of communist rule imposed after deals between the ussr and the usa and britain at the end of world war ii .
Argumentative	 many within the boundaries of the former soviet union such as belarus and increasingly ukraine have reverted to more authoritarian governments .
Argumentative	 these states should not be abandoned by their western neighbours .
Argumentative	 europe has just as much responsibility to those states within europe that have so far been left out the european union 's enlargement as it did to those countries of central and eastern europe that were accepted in the most recent enlargements .
Argumentative	 expansion means extending a project which has ensured unprecedented levels of peace and cooperation among former enemies in western europe for nearly half a century .
Argumentative	 this was the original purpose of the european project .
Argumentative	 the european union started out as the european coal and steel community which shared these important strategic resources that were necessary to fight a war .
Argumentative	 it was argued that this integration is the only way to keep france and germany , enemies that had fought three wars in the previous eighty years , from attacking each other .
Argumentative	 entrenching peace , democracy and economic integration throughout the continent is to the benefit of all european nations , the most recent two wars ; world war i and world war ii expanded to include the whole of europe and much of the rest of the world .
Argumentative	 the european union also means that there is no concern that there will be conflict .
Argumentative	 this both allows members of the european union to spend less on defence -- only the uk , france and greece meet nato 's% of gdp targetand frees up european forces for peacekeeping missions such as those in the in the western balkans in bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia , but also further afield , for exampletroops were deployed as an eu force in chad in 2008-9 .
Argumentative	 the current economic crisis within europe masks its immense success in turning new member states into prosperous economies while also benefiting those who were already members .
Argumentative	 betweenandtrade between the new and old member states grew frombillion euros tobillion , this outweighs the cost of eu financial assistance to the new members which only amounts to between 0.2-0 .3 % of eu gdp .
Argumentative	 for example british exports to thenew member states were worth # 11.6 billion incompared to # 4.5 billion inwhereas the dutch government estimates that the benefits of enlargement to each of its inhabitants waseuros .
Argumentative	 admitting new members is also necessary over the long term in order to counter the aging that is occurring in europe .
Argumentative	 every member of the european union has an aging population and a fertility rate below the replacement rate of 2.1 .
Argumentative	 encouraging economic growth in countries that are old and getting older is difficult because they are less inclined to take risks and be innovative .
Argumentative	 this means that europe needs more young workers ; these can be gained either through immigration from the rest of the world or through admitting more vibrant economies into the european union .
Argumentative	 turkey is a good example of the kind of country the eu needs to allow to join ; its economy is growing rapidly , even faster than china 's in the first half of, and the median age of the population is still only.
Argumentative	 the prospect of joining the eu has been an impetus for reform in many ex-communist countries , driving changes , e.g. legal reforms , privatizations , human rights , that are desirable in their own right .
Argumentative	 the progress made in a few years by the first wave of eastern european states to join the european union was impressive and membership was their deserved reward .
Argumentative	 conversely , if the prospect of eu membership was now denied to those states that are still hoping to join in the future , these states are likely to be unwilling to implement the unpopular reforms that the european union would like .
Argumentative	 even in countries that are not on any eu lists of applicant or potential members the door to enlargement has a positive influence .
Argumentative	 the prospect of joining the european union has tempted even those who might naturally be inclined to look the other way .
Argumentative	 viktor yanukovych was the pro-russian candidate in ukraine yet he has continued on the path towards eu membership since taking office for example creating the legislation necessary for an eu-ukraine free trade zone .
Argumentative	 enlargement is a unique opportunity to encourage nations to take a path which will lead them to becoming prosperous developed democracies .
Argumentative	 most states are unwilling to accept lectures on where they are going wrong and would , like russia has for example done , accuse western nations of violations against its sovereignty if there are attempts to encourage civil society , democracy or more westernized economies .
Argumentative	 vladimir putin has many times made statements referring to western ngo such as `` the activities of `` pseudo-ngos '' and other agencies that try to destabilize other countries with outside support are unacceptable . ''
Argumentative	 however these are much more palatable if the end result is membership in the european union and the reforms are accompanied by european expertise and money , per-accession assistance currently totals 12.9 billion euros .
