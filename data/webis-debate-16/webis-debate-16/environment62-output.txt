Non-Argumentative	the latest report (fifth) from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) put the blame for climate change firmly on humanity.
Non-Argumentative	 the chair of the working group on physical science notes “we give very relevant guidance on the total amount of carbon that can't be emitted to stay to 1.5 or 2⁰c. we are not on the path that would lead us to respect that warming target” leading to the un secretary general stating “the heat is on.
Non-Argumentative	 we must act.”
Non-Argumentative	 past experience however shows they won’t.
Non-Argumentative	the most obvious alternative is to accept that climate change is coming and to begin preparing for it.
Non-Argumentative	 adaptation is “adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.”
Non-Argumentative	 adaptation is often thought of being purely physical; building higher sea walls and more resilient infrastructure.
Non-Argumentative	 but it is much more than that including “diversification of livelihood activities, institutions both formal and informal, adjustments in farming operations… seasonal forecasts… having adequate grain reserves, weather insurance, food price subsidies” etc. this means that adaptation can mean anything from new methods of farming to migrating to areas that are going to see more, not less rainfall.
Non-Argumentative	however any such adaptation is going to be costly so the question of ‘who pays?’
Non-Argumentative	 is as prominent in adaptation as it was in reducing emissions.
Non-Argumentative	 in the doha summit ofprime minister hailemariam of ethiopia pointed out that rather than new pledges “we are going to push especially for the powerful countries to implement previous decisions.”
Non-Argumentative	 the green climate fund is supposed to receive $100billion per year bybut funding is barely reaching $10billion per year.
Non-Argumentative	 there is no way to force countries to stump up funds to help others prevent the effects of climate change but should the developed world consider itself obliged to meet its obligations and fund adaptation, particularly for the poorest and hardest hit such as africa?
Argumentative	 lives are already being lost to climate change ; a report by climate vulnerability monitor estimates that already almost 5million are lost per year to climate change , even without the distorting numbers from pollution there are 400,000 deaths per year .
Argumentative	 while attributing individual events to climate change is difficult research by climate scientists suggests that the lack long rains in somalia in earlyis betweenand% the result of greenhouse gasses .
Argumentative	 this famine has killed betweenandthousand people .
Argumentative	 with lives being lost the urgency of funding adaptation to reduce these loses is clear .
Argumentative	 a report by the united nations environmental project estimates that adaptation costs to africa per year could already be $ 15billion , reach $ 50billion byand anything up to $ 350billion by.
Argumentative	 funding for adaptation to africa inwas only $ 454milliion .
Argumentative	 this is not a gap that africa can make up itself ; inall spending on education was less than $ 50billion .
Argumentative	 africa ca n't afford to adapt itself while responding to an expanding population as well as its existing problems of poverty and disease .
Argumentative	 it is clear that developed countries that do have the resources have to step it and take responsibility .
Argumentative	 the ipcc says that it is `` extremely likely '' that human activities are the cause of the temperature rise .
Argumentative	 this means the biggest historical emitters have a responsibility to pay for the consequences .
Argumentative	 fromtothe united states produced 314,772 million metric tonnes of co2 compared to china 's 89,243 million metric tonnes and while india now produces more co2 germany over the same period emitted three times as much .
Argumentative	 history matters as much of the co2 remains in the atmosphere for decades or hundreds of years .
Argumentative	 it is the responsibility of those who caused the problem to protect innocents from the fallout of their actions .
Argumentative	 the ipcc starts its chapter on africa `` africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate change and climate variability '' .
Argumentative	 it is also the poorest continent in the world so least able to cope .
Argumentative	 in the gain index by the global adaptation institute which measures vulnerability and readiness for climate change eight of the bottom ten are african states .
Argumentative	 the changes to africa could be dramatic ;% of wildlife habitats could disappear , crop yields fall by% despite already being the lowest in the world andmillion are at risk of flooding as sea levels rise .
Argumentative	 if anywhere needs help from developed countries in adaptation it is africa .
Argumentative	 many of the areas of adaptation are areas where the west has the relevant expertise ; seasonal forecasting , adjusting farming -- perhaps by engineering hardier plants , weather insurance etc, africa does not have experience or experts in many of the relevant areas , for example africa lags behind in bioscience , so it makes sense for the west to provide these experts .
Argumentative	 and while they do so the west might as well also pay the cost of these expertise and also provide the necessary skills education and training to overcome these problems .
