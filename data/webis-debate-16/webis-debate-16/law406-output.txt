Non-Argumentative	the icc does not have its own police force.
Non-Argumentative	 currently, in order for the icc to be able to bring defendants to trial, it needs to enlist the assistance of member states in order to bring defendants in to trial.
Non-Argumentative	 in theory, this should be automatic.
Non-Argumentative	however, in practice this is not the case.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition to the failure to capture joseph kony and other lra leaders in the uganda situation, sudanese president omar al-bashir travelled to an african union event in nigeria, a state party to the icc, but the nigerian authorities claimed that they could not arrest him due to provisions in the au treaties.
Non-Argumentative	an icc enforcement arm could take on a large number of forms, and its proponents have not formed a consensus around any one of them.
Non-Argumentative	 it could be on various sizes, be based in one location or out of several.
Non-Argumentative	 one area that would need to be established is if it were to be based on the complementarity principle that is used for making decisions to prosecute – the icc will not get involved unless the state is unable or unwilling to take action.
Non-Argumentative	what exactly would an enforcement arm for the icc look like?
Non-Argumentative	 there have in the past been suggestions that there should be a united nations rapid reaction force capable of intervening in crisis situations of cases of state collapse, in the 1990s the un secretary general kofi annan decided against any attempt to create a un standing army, but wished to increase the rapidity of response using un members.
Non-Argumentative	 what an enforcement arm for the icc means then could be anything from such a standing army down to a small force made up of experts that supports national militaries with training and technology based on the model of the multinational police forces set up in bosnia in the late 1990s.
Non-Argumentative	in this instance we intend to take a middle course between the extremes of a light training force and a full scale army.
Non-Argumentative	 an icc enforcement arm would potentially be quite heavily armed as it may need to fight armed non-governmental groups but it would not have the capabilities to engage even the smallest states.
Non-Argumentative	 it would not therefore be able to snatch a war criminal who is being specifically sheltered by a state.
Non-Argumentative	 the mandate of the force would be to intervene either if asked to help internally by a national government or authorised by a united nations security council resolution which would to a certain extent enable the pursuit of a war criminal across borders.
Argumentative	 the remit of the icc is unlike the remit of any national court .
Argumentative	 it deals exclusively in crimes so unacceptable there is an international consensus behind their illegality and the need for prosecutions .
Argumentative	 the parties that signed up to the rome statute 's reason for the creation of the icc was `` that such grave crimes threaten the peace , security and well-being of the world '' the perpetrators of such crimes clearly need to be brought to book , and to do that they need to be apprehended .
Argumentative	 the same agreement said the signatories were `` resolved to guarantee lasting respect for and the enforcement of international justice '' if this is the case then there should be agreement on enabling that enforcement by creating an icc enforcement arm .
Argumentative	 again the rome statute makes clear that the agreement `` shall not be taken as authorizing '' intervention by another state .
Argumentative	 this is why the enforcement needs to be done by a separate international force who could not be considered a threat to any state .
Argumentative	 quite simply there is little point in international criminal justice if there is no force to bring the criminals to the court .
Argumentative	 if international criminals are to be caught it needs to be clear that there is an organisation with the responsibility and authority to catch them .
Argumentative	 this is especially important when the criminal in question is able to slip across borders to avoid the national authorities in one state as joseph kony has done as the icc would be able to cross borders itself and coordinate the response from multiple countries .
Argumentative	 the importance of an organisation that is able to catch international criminals can be highlighted by the experience of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia where despite a memorandum of understanding relating to the detention of war criminals in bosnia nato denied it had the power to make arrests so leading to patrols actively avoiding wanted men to avoid a situation in which they might have to engage in arrests.
Argumentative	a lack of clarity over whether an organisation can enforce its warrants for arrest results in arrests not being made .
Argumentative	 ultimately the icty was successful because this situation was resolved with the creation of multinational police forces backed up with traditional nato military power if necessary leading to the arrest ofindividuals .
Argumentative	 eight out of the thirty people indicted by the icc , four in the darfur situation , including omar al-bashir , three lord 's resistance army leaders in uganda and one in the dr congo investigation , are still alive and avoiding justice .
Argumentative	 an in-house enforcement arm would be more effective at capturing indictees than many of the forces of the state parties , as it is likely to be more competent than many of the under-resourced or under-trained national forces .
Argumentative	 an in house force would be solely focused on capturing the wanted war criminals so would both be focusing resources and much less likely to be sidetracked by other priorities , many of which may be influenced by politics , than national forces .
Argumentative	 one of the suggested solutions to the failure to capture joseph kony and leaders of the lra is to have greater involvement of peacekeepers ; an icc force would provide the same kind of help .
Argumentative	 to its critics , the icc is an organization that can be mocked with stalin 's dismissal of the influence of the pope : `` how many divisions does he have ? ''
Argumentative	 an icc capable of arresting its own fugitives would become a more credible organization , not only due to the show of competence through the arrests -- it would lead to more trials , and more convictions , that would help contribute to the acceptance of the icc as a serious court that is effective at bringing international criminals to justice .
Argumentative	 a legal institution needs to be effective to remain credible .
Argumentative	 this would make countries much more likely to cooperate because the icc would be doing more to help them by providing some of the necessary resources .
Argumentative	 henry kissinger apparently said `` who do i call if i want to speak to europe ? ''
Argumentative	 , he is not sure he said it , because there is no single european leader , and if the us wants political or military cooperation it calls the uk or france .
Argumentative	 in much the same way if countries need help apprehending and convicting someone they are much more likely to call in the icc if it can actually help them catch the wanted person .
