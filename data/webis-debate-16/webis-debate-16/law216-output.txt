Non-Argumentative	especially since the end of world war ii, there have been calls for a global system of justice and an effort to prevent massive atrocities from occurring.
Non-Argumentative	 tribunals to prosecute crimes committed in yugoslavia and rwanda brought up the question of whether a permanent court would be beneficial.
Non-Argumentative	 the international criminal court (icc) was born out of these efforts to recognize an international court on july 1,with the founding of the rome statute to prosecute crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes.
Non-Argumentative	 the rome statute states that the court also has jurisdiction over crimes of aggression, but lacks a definition of what constitutes those crimes and thus will only have the ability to prosecute them when there is an amendment passed.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc differs from the international court of justice (icj) in that the icj tries legal disputes between countries; the icc is specific to individuals.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc is a permanent court that will try individuals if either a) the security council refers a case to the court, or b) if the state on whose territory the crime was committed/the state of the accused's nationality has ratified the rome statute.
Non-Argumentative	 thus, the icc relies on the cooperation of member states to find and apprehend criminals.
Non-Argumentative	 the security council's role in the court was a contentious issue during the conference held to draft the rome statute and remains one of the issues with the court today; currently, the security council can either refer cases or delay them formonths an unlimited number of times.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc prosecutor may investigate cases based upon information from reliable sources other than the security council such as non-governmental organizations, victims, etc.1currently,countries have ratified the rome statute and anotherhave signed but not ratified the treaty.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents argue that the icc is a necessary step to fight heinous crimes and institute justice while deterring crime in an increasingly globalized world.
Non-Argumentative	 other nations who oppose the icc, such as the united states, china, and russia cite issues of sovereignty and abuse.
Non-Argumentative	 possible alternatives to the icc include individual tribunals and reconciliation programs.
Non-Argumentative	 this questions whether the icc should be accepted by nations and consequently whether states should ratify the rome statute.1 prakash, k. p. "international criminal court: a review."

Argumentative	the icc is uniquely beneficial because of its intention to be a permanent force that will always hold people accountable , instead of slowly reacting to crimes after-the-fact .
Argumentative	 it is intended to be universal and apply to every situation without mandating the creation of a new tribunal every time something happens , and may be even more effective than tribunals at responding to crimes .
Argumentative	 even though tribunals such as the ones for the former yugoslavia and rwanda may have worked , they were `` necessarily limited in scope '' and can not be applied on a large scale , which is what is needed .1 additionally , those tribunals were relatively ineffective , as they took two years to set up , and relying on establishing new tribunals every single time wastes precious time .
Argumentative	 doing so would also let smaller but still serious crimes slip under the radar , as they would not warrant the creation of a new tribunal , but may still count as a crime against humanity .2 1 kirsch , philippe .

Argumentative	 the only way to ensure that leaders get what they deserve is to establish a free-standing , independent court that holds people accountable .
Argumentative	 the icc acts as a permanent international court , as opposed to tribunals set up by a specific group of nations .1 by issuing arrest warrants for leaders who would otherwise continue their actions without any blame , the icc attempts to punish them .
Argumentative	 the goal is to ensure that no individual gets away with committing terrible crimes .
Argumentative	 additionally , the court gives victims a role in the process , has the power to give them reparations , and ensures they see criminals brought to justice .2 the court has not punished anyone yet because it is still considerably young , but has proceedings going on currently .

Argumentative	 in today 's world , crimes are no longer confined to single nations and affect the world due to the effects of globalization .
Argumentative	 an international court is necessary as a global solution to problems that often involve multiple actors ; a permanent international court accounts for all parties involved .1 for example the lord 's resistance army has been mostly active in uganda but has often hidden from the ugandan military by crossing into southern sudan or the democratic republic of congo .
Argumentative	 because it is not limited to a specific territory , the icc has truly global jurisdiction and therefore is most appropriate given the recent rise of international crimes .
Argumentative	 joining the icc would also encourage nations to recognize that crimes are no longer confined to specific borders and that the notion of territoriality provides a dangerously limited view of the scope of crimes today ; ratifying the rome statute would force nations to recognize that domestic and international law inevitably interact .2 the domestic-foreign distinction has allowed states to ignore or commit certain atrocities in the name of national interest .
Argumentative	 there is a growing global consensus that crimes against humanity need to be punished , as demonstrated by the tribunals to address the crimes of yugoslavia and rwanda .
Argumentative	 the question is no longer whether we should set up an international court but rather how to best do it , and the icc gives the international community a framework within which to work to establish a strong courts .1 rejection of the icc has become a symbol of rejection of international norms , and countries that have refused to ratify the rome statute in the name of national interest , such as the united states , have been seen as imperialist , isolationist , and against global efforts to tackle important issues .
