Non-Argumentative	it has for a long time been recognized that migration is in large part caused by economic factors; people leave poorer rural areas and move to the city, they move from less developed to more developed countries.
Non-Argumentative	 in each case they are looking for a better life so go to somewhere where they believe they will find it.
Non-Argumentative	 it has however usually been considered that these people moving around the world in search of work are doing so mostly for themselves, instead it is increasingly clear that they are doing it as much for their families who have been left behind.
Non-Argumentative	the flow of money from migrants has been shooting up in recent years, according to the world bank remittances topped $530 billion in 2012.
Non-Argumentative	 this represents a tripling of remittances within the last decade and indeed it is likely that the amount of money being transferred is much higher as many migrants bypass banks and big money transfer companies that provide the date the world bank is using.
Non-Argumentative	with such huge amounts of money being sent home we might very well ask whether migration could be a driver of development rather than relying on aid?
Non-Argumentative	 the level of flows of money recorded by the world bank is more than three times the total of global aid budgets and of course it does not have strings attached to how it is spent.
Non-Argumentative	 many countries get huge amounts from remittances; india and china each received more than £60billion, the philippines and mexico both had $24billion sent, while nigeria received $21 billion.
Non-Argumentative	 for the philippines in particular $24 billion would represent more than 10% of the country’s gdp.
Non-Argumentative	 for some small countries this can be even higher, in liberia remittances receive the equivalent of 31% of the country’s gdp.
Non-Argumentative	 the amounts are so big that several countries, including the philippines, have sent up ministries to manage the cash sent from overseas.
Non-Argumentative	clearly the proposal is not to replace all aid with no change to remittances; this would just be taking something away so would be in no way beneficial to those who receive aid.
Non-Argumentative	 instead official development assistance, “grants and concessional loans for development and welfare purposes from the government sector of a donor country to a developing country or multilateral agency active in development”,  would be replaced with increased remittances.
Non-Argumentative	 this would be spurred by governments taking action in several ways; providing tax breaks and incentives for those sending home remittances, and by reducing the cost of sending money home by dropping the cut taken by banks and wire transfer firms.
Non-Argumentative	 the g8 has pledged to reduce the cost of global transfers to an average of 5% by 2014, which would be a significant drop from the 9% it is at the moment and the average should be brought down to the 2-3% where it would be if there was sufficient competition.
Non-Argumentative	note: for the purposes of this debate we are not going to go into detail about whether this will result in more or less money going to developing nations.
Non-Argumentative	 it will be assumed that the developed countries would be giving as much by their tax breaks and reductions in costs as they would be in aid.
Non-Argumentative	 this does not seem too unreasonable, oda from oecd countries was $135bln in 2011, a drop in transfer costs of 7% would save $37bln, and the rest would be made up by tax breaks and incentives.
Argumentative	  changing from oda to remittances is good for freedom of choice in two ways .
Argumentative	 first tax breaks and other incentives will mean that migrants have more money .
Argumentative	 it will clearly be up to the migrant to decide if they want to or can afford to send their money home ; they can decide how much they want to send , when they want to end it , how they want to send it etc, at the other end it will be up to the individual recipient to decide how they want to spend the money received .
Argumentative	 secondly it is good for the freedom of choice of the taxpayer .
Argumentative	 at the moment they are having their choice taken away from them as they have their own money being spent by the government on someone else ; foreign countries .
Argumentative	 the individual taxpayer sees none of the benefit of this money and often they do n't like paying so much aid ,% of americans support cutting aid .
Argumentative	 rwanda has been trying to increase the size of remittances in order to increase its autonomy .
Argumentative	 the president paul kagame has said `` aid is never enough and we need to complement it with homegrown schemes to accelerate growth . ''
Argumentative	 he wants `` a higher level of direct ownership in the nation 's projects '' and wants it because western donors had suspended aid .
Argumentative	 a change to remittances would reduce this vulnerability ; it would be much more difficult for ` donors ' to suspend the tax breaks they provide for remittances to individual countries than it is to cut aid .
Argumentative	 indeed remittances are noticeably stable with money still being sent home during recessions and can even be countercyclical as migrants will send more if they know things are bad back home .
Argumentative	 this then takes the issue out of the hands of the politicians and puts it into the hands of the people .
Argumentative	 there has been a lot of concern that aid , particularly from governments and international organisations , does not always help reduce poverty ; it might simply create dependence , or it prevents local enterprise .
Argumentative	 dambisa moyo points out that `` betweenand, when aid flows to africa were at their peak , poverty in africa rose from% to a staggering% '' .
Argumentative	 remittances on the other hand can be very beneficial ; they provide the money needed to start enterprises , and they are showing that the community is not dependent as its members have taken the initiative to go and find work .
Argumentative	 remittances have a statistically significant impact on reducing poverty .
Argumentative	 inthe world bank suggested that a% increase in per capita international remittances will lead to a 3.5 % decline in the share of people living in poverty .
Argumentative	 governments should therefore change from the method that is failing to one that is more successful at reducing poverty .
