Non-Argumentative	developmental aid exists in a variety of forms such as the official developmental assistance (oda) awarded by donor nations in the un’s development assistance committee (dac).
Non-Argumentative	   these flows of official financing are given with the aim of “promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective…”.
Non-Argumentative	 although there may be discussion over what parameters or index should be used to measure the overall development of a nation, the success of the awarded aid depends largely on the localised effects of the particular aid projects and any wider results that have been obtained.
Non-Argumentative	 oda often has strings attached to the aid, but this usually is conditions such as equipment having to be bought from the country that is providing the aid.
Non-Argumentative	 there may sometimes be other conditions such as a country being unwilling to give development assistance to countries that have particularly poor human rights records, though this will almost certainly not apply to any emergency aid.
Non-Argumentative	 for example the uk suspended aid to rwanda at the end ofin response to reports showing rwanda was fueling the civil war in neighbouring congo.
Non-Argumentative	this however does not usually translate into action in other similar areas.
Non-Argumentative	 in the contexts of scarce accountability and poor labour standards, development aid often carries on regardless.
Non-Argumentative	 this is despite international labour standards, being particularly suited to ensure that economic development remains concentrated on improving human life and dignity by making sure that economic growth and development go along with the creation of decent work.
Non-Argumentative	 in other words labour standards could be seen as a core part of any sustainable development that such aid is aiming to achieve.
Non-Argumentative	 should raising labour standards therefore, to increase the efficacy of aid, be considered a pre-requisite for development aid.
Non-Argumentative	 whether this is a fair, efficient and more importantly, achievable criterion to be met by developing nations is the keystone focus of this debate.
Argumentative	 labour and business standards are a cornerstone of agreement on universal human rights between various international actors and so it is right that they should be linked to aid .
Argumentative	 inthe ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work were adopted and are considered binding on all members regardless of whether they have ratified the conventions .
Argumentative	 the business and labour regulations protect the basic worker rights and improve job security through demanding the elimination of discrimination and empower workers through the recognition of `` freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining '' like in those in developed western countries .
Argumentative	 this then provides a minimum standard and aid should only be given to those that ensure those minimum standards they have signed up .
Argumentative	 it would also help compliance to prioritise those who go further in their protections of labour when it comes to receiving aid .
Argumentative	 it should be remembered that there has been general acceptance of international labour standards not just for human rights reasons but also because having minimum standards is beneficial economically -- for example ahour working week is more productive per hour than ahour week .
Argumentative	 what are international labour and business standards ?
Argumentative	 they are globally acceptable methods of doing business and employing labour .
Argumentative	 these include conventions against forced labour , discrimination and child labour .
Argumentative	 these also form guideline structures for social policy such as labour dispute resolution bodies , employment services and good industrial relations .
Argumentative	 therefore , this goes hand in hand with reducing poverty and increasing the standard of living of the employees , and hence the standard is a facet of development in itself .
Argumentative	 this helps in achieving the goals of a stable long term plan for economic growth as well paid workers are necessary for consumer spending .
Argumentative	 employing higher standards would be a way to tackle the problems with distribution of aid at the grassroots and increase efficiency within the system organically .
Argumentative	 the poorest countries invariably have the lowest standards of labour and business .
Argumentative	 it is essential to raise these standards to an international level , implementing standards against practices like child labour .
Argumentative	 if this is done then the purpose of development aid , which is to increase the day to day standard of living of the people , will improve .
Argumentative	 in an absence of such a pre-requisite , a developing country will be free to employ standards that do not reflect the same principles of the donor nation .
Argumentative	 thus , to avoid a hypocritical scenario , this pre-requisite is necessary .
Argumentative	 increasing the required standard of business and labour will result in increases to the current standard labour and business standards even before aid is entirely tied as countries implement changes to ensure they get the most possible aid .
Argumentative	 simply setting an expected level of labour and business standards will therefore create improvement in those standards .
Argumentative	 in the case of the decent work country programme for bangladesh 2006-2009 bangladesh has been implementing the program due to its positive benefit towards achieving the millennium development goals .
Argumentative	 this is despite challenges such as the lack of employment opportunities in the country .
Argumentative	 the programme has been successful in improving social protection , working conditions and rights for female , male , and children workers in a few sectors and areas .
Argumentative	 when a donor nation parts with foreign aid for development to a nation , it must always choose who it prefers to give it to as there is a limited pot of money to donate there needs to be a way of allocating it .
Argumentative	 it is not surprising therefore that countries with shared colonial histories tend to dominate aid flows , thus britain has historically given most aid to countries that were its colonies ; inmalta and cyprus received most , while india was the biggest recipient for much of the rest of the 20th century .
Argumentative	 further , often countries offering aid , such as the us , the uk , and the eu , require the pre-requisite of democracy or the start of a democratisation process .
Argumentative	 therefore , it is justified to add a pre-requisite for better standards of business and labour as it helps implementation , and principally meets the goals of the developmental aid itself .
Argumentative	 as long as developing nations constantly keep employing poor labour standards , it will keep putting a strain on the global economy .
Argumentative	 this is because other countries will be pressured to do the same just to remain competitive .
Argumentative	 this creates a race to the bottom effect and would create `` poor conditions and loss of freedom in the global south , and causes workers in the global north to lose their jobs to cheap outsourced labour '' .
Argumentative	 higher labour standards in developing countries therefore also benefits developed countries .
Argumentative	 however the converse is also true ; labels like ` fair trade ' provide a guarantee of ethical quality and show that consumers are willing to pay more to ensure good labour standards .
