Non-Argumentative	at present all children born in the usa are automatically made citizens of the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 this applies even if one or both parents are not themselves us citizens – they could be illegal immigrants, tourists, students, or legal immigrants temporarily working in america.
Non-Argumentative	 in many other countries birthright citizenship does not exist; babies born in countries such as the uk or japan do not automatically become citizens as their status depends on the citizenship and immigration status of their parents.
Non-Argumentative	 as the debate over illegal immigration in the usa has gained strength over the past decade, there have been calls to change the us system by removing birthright citizenship.
Non-Argumentative	 similar debates have occurred in other countries, with ireland voting by referendum to end birthright citizenship in 2005.
Non-Argumentative	 on the other hand germany used to restrict citizenship to those of german descent, but changed its laws into give citizenship to many children born in germany to parents who were non-citizen “guest-workers” (most turkish in origin).
Non-Argumentative	the debate in the usa is complicated by the origins of birthright citizenship there.
Non-Argumentative	 the original united states constitution, written in 1787, assumed the concept of citizenship but did not define it.
Non-Argumentative	 courts at state and federal level (notably lynch v. clarke in 1844) applied the english common law principle of “jus soli” - the idea that you gain citizenship by virtue of your birth in a particular country – rather than “jus sanguinis” (“citizenship of blood”), the alternative concept that a child acquires the status of their parents.
Non-Argumentative	 however, major exceptions were made for native americans and african-americans; notoriously, in thecase of dred scott vs sandford the us supreme court found that no african-american, whether slave or free, could be a citizen of the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 this is why after the civil war and the abolition of slavery, the 14th amendment to the constitution was passed in(ratified 1868).
Non-Argumentative	 this says that “all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside.”
Non-Argumentative	 because of the 14th amendment it is usually argued that the only way to remove the right of birthright citizenship would be to amend the us constitution.
Non-Argumentative	 although some republicans are keen to overturn birthright citizenship, the party is not united on this issue and democrats are solidly against the proposal, so a constitutional amendment to this effect is very unlikely to pass.
Argumentative	 however, some advocates of a change argue that the 14th amendment has been misinterpreted in the past, and that by passing ordinary laws at federal or state level that challenge birthright citizenship, they could force the supreme court to look again at the issue.
Argumentative	the national security of the state depends on shared values , norms and principles , factors that by definition can not be tested and massaged whilst immigrants hide in the shadows and refuse to come forward .
Argumentative	 birthright citizenship encourages the assimilation of families and cultures as a whole into that of the state , forming not a homogeneity but a comfortable and restrained multiculturalism joined at the core by certain shared principles .
Argumentative	 as john mccain noted in aspeech , ` we have a national interest in identifying individuals , incentivizing them to come forward out of the shadows ... regularize their status '.
Argumentative	 therefore , to ensure that state derives the most it can out of its citizens , it is in their interest to give them citizenship at birth rather than turn a blind eye to the illegal underclass .
Argumentative	 birthright citizenship prevents an increase in the number of illegal residents .
Argumentative	 as more children of current illegal aliens are denied citizenship , we will be creating a permanent , ` marginalized and undereducated ' underclass with few civil rights , likely to be alienated from our society but knowing no other homeland to which they could return .
Argumentative	 a recent migration policy institute study found that the removal of birthright citizenship would lead to a% increase in the illegal immigrant community .
Argumentative	 more illegal immigrants creates a hereditary poverty due to the understandable barriers to entry in the job market for non-citizens .
Argumentative	 further to that , jared bernstein , a senior economist , argues that illegal immigrants are statistically poorer because they lack access to the economic advantages conferred by citizenship ; ` while 9.8 % of those naturalized are poor , the share for non-citizens is a whopping 21.6 % ' .
Argumentative	 to increase the amount of illegal immigrants with such statistics in mind would only serve to exacerbate the poverty of such groups and provide a sore for the state as a whole .
Argumentative	 birthright citizenship has been a critical driver of integration for generations .
Argumentative	 for newly arrived immigrants , knowing that their children will have full citizenship has encouraged them to work hard , put down roots and invest in their new country .
Argumentative	 for their citizen children , knowing they have equal opportunities with all other young americans has led them to work hard to achieve their dreams .
Argumentative	 as tamar jacoby of the manhattan institute argues , ` newcomers put down roots and invest all-out in their lives because they know their children will be guaranteed full membership ' .
Argumentative	 if birthright citizenship is removed , the process of integration will inevitably stutter .
Argumentative	 over the years , many children born in america will end up without citizenship anywhere , including a third generation that has no links to any other state .
Argumentative	 removing birthright citizenship will involve costly unintended consequences .
Argumentative	 a huge new federal bureaucracy will be needed to keep track of millions of residents who lack citizenship , but who can not be deported because they have no citizenship elsewhere either .
Argumentative	 as tamar jacoby points out ` these young people know no other home , many will never learn the language of their parents , and very few will even consider going back to the old country ' .
Argumentative	 it will be , as legal expert margaret stick notes , ' a bureaucratic nightmare ' requiring the hiring of ` thousands of lawyers to adjudicate people 's applications and figure out whether they are citizens or not ' .
Argumentative	 furthermore , it may have wider effects in society .
Argumentative	 in the united states for example , ` the vast majority of people prove their citizenship through a birth certificate , and if that is no longer considered proof that you are an american citizen , they are going to have to come up with something else ' .
Argumentative	 in summary therefore , the costs of the removal of the birthright citizenship far exceed the likely benefits .
Argumentative	 a child has no choice where it is born , and the child of non-citizen parents should be recognized as a citizen just as much as the child born to those who can trace their citizenship back through many generations .
Argumentative	 the united states is famously a nation of immigrants , welcoming `` huddled masses yearning to breathe free '' on the statue of liberty .
Argumentative	 unlike germany or japan , where ethnicity has traditionally been the criteria for citizenship , the usa is a melting-pot , uniting people of diverse origins under one flag .
Argumentative	 throughout us history the children of non-citizens have been accepted as true americans , paying taxes , being drafted and fighting for the flag in wartime , and being elected to office .
Argumentative	 as enshrined in the 14th amendment of the u.s. constitution , ` all persons born or naturalized in the united states , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the united states ' .
Argumentative	 this is what america stands for , what made the nation great ; it is a proud history which should not be rejected .
