Non-Argumentative	organ donations are one of the most vital steps of progress made in the field of medicine.
Non-Argumentative	 where the failure of a vital organ previously would lead to a person’s imminent death, there is a chance today of saving lives by transplanting hearts, kidneys, livers etc. however, in the case of organs such as hearts and livers, transplantation can only take place if a patient’s need coincides with the death of a donor.
Non-Argumentative	 in the status quo, many people die as there is not a sufficient amount of organs that match the blood type and antibodies of the recipients.
Non-Argumentative	 if these are not matched then there is a chance of rejection of the organ.
Non-Argumentative	 live donations are growing becoming more common and often increase survival rates but this is only for cases where an organ can be donated with little risk of life such as with a kidney.
Non-Argumentative	 this proposal is much more extreme as it would allow parents instead of standing by watching their children die, unable to do anything to save them to take action.
Non-Argumentative	 the proposed motion would allow the relatives whose organs would save their loved one to donate their organ at the expense of their own life.
Non-Argumentative	 while this is an attractive idea to some, for others it violates the fundamental principles of how we are to relate to life.
Non-Argumentative	 it also touches upon the question of whether one can qualify and quantify human life.
Non-Argumentative	 regardless of which side might be found to be right, it is a motion that affects families at a pivotal point of their lives, but also health care professionals, religions, politicians and society as a whole.
Argumentative	 we are biologically programmed to want to preserve our species .
Argumentative	 as such , our offspring will often be more important to ourselves than our own persons .
Argumentative	 many doctors hear parents tell them how they wish that they could `` take over '' their child 's terminal illness rather than have the child suffer .
Argumentative	 it is therefore natural and right for the older generation to sacrifice itself where possible to save the younger generation .
Argumentative	 as crass as this might seem , they are statistically more likely to die earlier than their offspring in any event and stand to lose less .
Argumentative	 they have had the chance to experience more of a life than their child .
Argumentative	 they are furthermore the cause of the child 's existence , and owe it to the child to protect it at any cost .
Argumentative	 it is not fair to ask of a parent to live with the guilt of having been able to save their child and not doing so .
Argumentative	 believing that they are guilty of their child 's death can cause post-traumatic stress syndrome , which in turn is a major cause of suicides .
Argumentative	 it is a fundamental principle of the human being is that every human is born autonomous .
Argumentative	 therefore , we believe that every person has a right to his or her own body and is thus competent to make decisions about it .
Argumentative	 this is because we recognise that whatever decisions we might make about our bodies , stem from the knowledge that we have about our own preferences .
Argumentative	 nobody can tell us how to value different goods and therefore what matters to one person might matter less to another .
Argumentative	 if we were to undermine this right , nobody would be able to live their life to its fullest as they would be living their life to someone else 's fullest .
Argumentative	 the extension of this right is that if someone values another person 's life over their own it is their informed decision to sacrifice themselves for that person .
Argumentative	 it is not for others to decide , and in particular not for the state .
Argumentative	 we have to be able to measure quality of life relatively .
Argumentative	 there might be many cases where a relative is terminally ill , yet not dead yet .
Argumentative	 this person , with a survival prospect of maybe half a year of suffering and medication , might have a perfectly functional organ .
Argumentative	 it is very rational , both for this person and for society as a whole to allow him or her to undergo euthanasia at an early stage to save the other person .
Argumentative	 furthermore , a person might sacrifice his or her life to provide an organ for a specific individual , yet their other organs can still be used to save others , of whom the donor might not have been aware .
Argumentative	 it is sad that a person has to die , but as this is the only option , it is a good thing that several people might live when one sacrifices their life .
Argumentative	 there is a clear need around the world for more donors of organs .
Argumentative	 in the uk there are abouttransplants a year but there are always more waiting , in novemberthere werepeople waiting so on average each will be waiting for almost two years .
Argumentative	 in germany there are over 12,000 waiting but onlydonations in.
Argumentative	 the sacrifice of individual relatives who willingly choose death to save their loved ones therefore brings the need for donations into focus .
Argumentative	 the media are likely to present heart-breaking stories about loving people who made the ultimate sacrifice .
Argumentative	 as a consequence , more people will be aware of the issue and wish to fill in donor cards so that they might be able to minimise the number of voluntary donations in the event of their death .
Argumentative	 thus there will be more naturally donated organs available and more lives will be saved .
