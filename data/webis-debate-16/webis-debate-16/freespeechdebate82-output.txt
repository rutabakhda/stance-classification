Non-Argumentative	the sophistication of modern surveillance technology has increased by leaps and bounds in the 21st century.
Non-Argumentative	 governments have unprecedented power to watch their citizens, to see almost every aspect of their private and public lives.
Non-Argumentative	 by use of cctv, internet censorship and infiltration, wire-taps, and a multitude of other systems, governments have enormous power to control the populace.
Non-Argumentative	undemocratic regimes have become some of the best customers of western surveillance tech companies and governments, using the technology to develop a firmer grip on their citizens who might seek to challenge the state.
Non-Argumentative	 they have exploited the desire of democracies’ desire for profit and influence in order to make themselves even more unassailable to the forces of dissent.
Non-Argumentative	 since the start of the civil war in syria there has been criticism that there have been sales of surveillance equipment to bashar al assad’s regime.
Non-Argumentative	 france for example has investigated a technology company qosmos for a project that involved software that allowed the syrian government to monitor political opponents, often leading to their arrest.
Non-Argumentative	 human rights groups allege that this is “complicity in torture”, if so executives could face criminal charges.
Non-Argumentative	a debate has emerged regarding the culpability of democracies in the continued oppression of people abroad.
Non-Argumentative	 some states already limit their sales of surveillance technology to non-democratic regimes, such as canada and to a lesser extent the united states, though no universal bans are prevalent.
Non-Argumentative	 there have been recent attempts in the us congress to change this by passing a ‘global online freedom act’ which would prevent such sales to ‘internet restricting countries’, inthis failed to pass but has been reintroduced.
Non-Argumentative	 should democracies refuse to sell technology that could be used for ill to regimes abroad, or does it have more to gain from treating them as equally valid governments?
Non-Argumentative	 this question forms the core of this debate, and is explored in the following arguments.
Argumentative	 high-tech surveillance technology has given repressive governments and police states a new lease on life .
Argumentative	 now more than ever they can intrude into every aspect of people 's lives , ensuring that dissent is cowed for fear of the ever present threat of the security services .
Argumentative	 the vision of orwell 'shas become a living nightmare for people all over the world .
Argumentative	 their power has made it extremely difficult for movements for reform , government accountability , and democracy , which have foundered when faced with these sophisticated security apparatuses , valentino-devries  .
Argumentative	 by dominating the flow of information states have the power to keep their people in check and prevent them from ever posing a threat to their repressive status quo .
Argumentative	 thus china blocks access to the internet and to other forms of communications in tibet to `` ensure the absolute security of tibet 's ideological and cultural realm '' .
Argumentative	 it cuts the tibetan people off from outside world so as to prevent any rerun of the instability that occurred in, which china blamed on the influence of the dalai lama from outside .
Argumentative	 only external help in alleviating this censorship could allow activists to organize effectively and perhaps to one day bring about genuine reform and justice to their societies .
Argumentative	 the surveillance equipment on which these regimes rely is often only available from firms and governments in the democratic world where , by and large , technology is generally far more advanced than in the non-democratic world .
Argumentative	 without access to these technologies , the regimes would be far more hard-pressed to keep rigid tabs on their citizens , allowing for the seeds of dissent to take root .
Argumentative	 only then can the forces clamouring for democracy hope to be able to organise networks of activists , and to have their views considered by the state .
Argumentative	 it is common for western democracies to make sweeping statements about the universality of certain rights , and that their system of government is the one that should be most sought after in the world , that democracy is the only legitimate form of government .
Argumentative	 as when obama in cairo proclaimed `` these are not just american ideas ; they are human rights .
Argumentative	 and that is why we will support them everywhere . ''
Argumentative	 they claim to work in the united nations and other organizations toward the improvement of rights in other countries and clamour about the need for building governments accountability around the world , using their liberal-democratic paradigm as the model .
Argumentative	 yet at the same time democratic governments and companies sell technologies to non-democratic allies that are used to systematically abuse the rights of citizens and to entrench the power of those avowedly illegitimate regimes .
Argumentative	 these hypocrisies read as a litany of shame .
Argumentative	 a telling example is the blair government in the united kingdom selling weapons to an oppressive regime in indonesia for the sake of political expediency even after proclaiming an ` ethical foreign policy ' .
Argumentative	 even if democracies do not feel it is a defensible position to actively seek to subvert all non-democratic states , and that non-democracies should be considered semi-legitimate on the basis of nations ' right to self-determination , they should still feel morally obliged not to abet those regimes by providing the very tools of oppression on which they rely .
Argumentative	 to continue dealing in these technologies serves only to make democratic countries ' statements hollow , and the rights they claim to uphold seem less absolute , a risk in itself to freedoms within democracies .
Argumentative	 respect for rights begins at home , and actively eroding them elsewhere reduces respect for them by home governments .
Argumentative	 corporations are private entities that have the right to sell their services and to deal with agents foreign and domestic , including governments .
Argumentative	 however , this right can be limited when those actions are oppositional to the aims of the home state in which they are incorporated .
Argumentative	 the sale of surveillance technology to undemocratic regimes stands against the avowed aims of democracies and against their strategic interests in bolstering democracy abroad and maintaining a reputation for fair dealing .
Argumentative	 for this reason it is perfectly legitimate for governments to ban the corporations within their borders from selling dangerous technologies to foreign governments .
Argumentative	 such is already the case with many kinds of strategic technology , especially weapons technology .
Argumentative	 the eu , for example , bans a range of arms sales to various oppressive states on these grounds , china in particular is an example where it would potentially be very lucrative to overturn the ban .
Argumentative	 corporations benefit from the protection of democratic states , as they provide bases of operations that shield their right to property and ensure stability and the rule of law .
Argumentative	 if corporations wish to benefit from these provisions they must be willing to accept the instructions of the states that house them regarding what can and can not be sold to foreign powers .
Argumentative	 a ban on the sale of surveillance technology to non-democracies serves ultimately as a statement of disapproval .
Argumentative	 it shows that the undemocratic regimes can not be trusted with the ability to spy on their people .
Argumentative	 this signal has several effects .
Argumentative	 an example of this international shaming affecting is the international bans on the use of landmines .
Argumentative	 various states created a framework , the ottawa convention , in which their condemnation pressured nearly every other state , including authoritarian regimes , to follow suit .
Argumentative	 domestically it serves to bolster people 's faith in the system of rights they value highly and enshrine in law .
Argumentative	 they can point to this ban as an example of their government 's desire to make a better world and not to increase repression for the sake of power or profit .
Argumentative	 in the undemocratic states themselves , the regime leaders will be faced with a significant public relations blow as they come under criticism .
Argumentative	 this serves to embolden and empower holders of dissenting opinions and to spark pro-democratic discourse .
Argumentative	 in the international community it makes an emphatic value judgement on the merit of certain systems of government , namely the superiority of democracy and government accountability to the people , principles most non-democracies still pay some form of lip-service to .
Argumentative	 overall , this policy boosts the credibility of democracy , while undermining the influence of undemocratic states .
