Non-Argumentative	the european union has since its inception had european integration beyond trade as its overarching goal.
Non-Argumentative	 in recent years, it has moved towards an increasingly closer political union.
Non-Argumentative	 many political competences that used to belong to nations have been transferred to permanent eu institutions such as the council of the eu, the european parliament, and the european commission.
Non-Argumentative	 in other words, the eu has gained increasing legislative and fiscal power, so that member states and their citizens are legally bound to follow eu laws which span increasingly contentious areas.
Non-Argumentative	 these include budget regulations through the maastricht criteria, but go beyond them: it is hard to think of an area of policy where the eu is not active (1).
Non-Argumentative	 the eu is therefore already a political union.
Non-Argumentative	since the beginning of the euro crisis, there has been pressure from some member states, and notably germany and france, to move towards an ever closer political union (2).
Non-Argumentative	 although they don’t yet exist common fiscal policies and a banking union can be seen as prerequisites to a sustainable eurozone – but shared education and law enforcement policies are also important for trade and interaction within the eu.
Non-Argumentative	 further political integration is therefore being considered as a possible response to the crisis in the eurozone.
Non-Argumentative	however, this sentiment is not shared by all.
Non-Argumentative	 disillusionment is spreading, the uk has for years had eurosceptic parties who want to go back to a trade bloc at most that do well in european elections, but the rise of alternative für deutschland even a book by a book by a former champion of european integration françois heisbourg suggests that the eu may need to put integration into reverse.
Non-Argumentative	 eu legislation is perceived by many as an intrusion on national sovereignty and as an obstacle to democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 some find it especially unwise to sacrifice their sovereignty for economic benefits, when they believe they end up losing both and having to bail out weaker economies.
Non-Argumentative	 an alternative to the status quo is for the european union to limit itself to being merely a trade bloc where its member countries remove barriers to trade between each other (such as tariffs).
Non-Argumentative	 this would maintain the key economic benefits of cooperation and make europe more competitive, without alienating its members.
Non-Argumentative	 in essence, the alternative of a trade bloc would mean preserving the single market, where people, services, and goods can move freely, while repatriating other powers currently at eu level to national governments.
Non-Argumentative	the single market has been highly beneficial to the eu, and it is mostly unquestioned that it should remain (3).
Non-Argumentative	 but can the eu succeed as a trade bloc without integration in other areas?
Non-Argumentative	 trade blocs exist worldwide that are reasonably successful without the involvement of a political union: nafta is one example.
Argumentative	 but are they really successful, and could the same policy apply to the eu?
Argumentative	the eu is too large for a democratic structure .
Argumentative	 since it deals not with citizens directly but with member states , a question arises as to which agents should make fundamental decisions .
Argumentative	 should every member state get an equal vote , or a vote in proportion to the size of its population ?
Argumentative	 if nation states get equal votes , a lot of people in larger states such as germany , france or spain may find themselves highly disenfranchised .
Argumentative	 on the other hand , if states get votes in proportion to the size of its population , countries such as luxembourg will be forever hesitant to join , and rightly so , for its citizens would most likely be excluded .
Argumentative	 the democratic deficit in the eu is no less visible in practice .
Argumentative	 the commission is not directly elected  ; council politics are confusing , take a long time , and grind to a halt whenever germany is in the middle of elections  ; and the voting turnout for european elections , where meps are elected , is too low to be considered a fair representation of voters ' views  .
Argumentative	 this poses a problem the moment the eu begins having legislative power in its member states : we must not let more and more aspects of citizen 's lives be affected by an institution that is increasingly undemocratic .
Argumentative	 many of the policies of the political union intrude on national legislation .
Argumentative	 in many cases , eu policies go against national traditions or redefine laws that were already functional .
Argumentative	 occasionally eu policies even cause direct harm , when countries have less freedom to tailor them to their own conditions .
Argumentative	 during the past few years , the commission 's powers have included monitoring member states implementation of austerity policies in return for bailouts .
Argumentative	 however , everyone , including the imf , agrees that austerity was unsuccessful and has seriously hampered recovery  .
Argumentative	 being a part of a political union inevitably means that sacrifices have to be made and this often intrudes on national sovereignty by reducing he room for manoeuvre of national governments .
Argumentative	 intrusion by the eu would be justified if it creates substantially better laws or solid trade benefits ; however , regulations on the shape of cucumbers  do neither of these .
Argumentative	 the eu should not have legislative power on these areas .
Argumentative	 the european project has gone too far for many european countries .
Argumentative	 for some such as norway or switzerland the eu has already gone far past the amount of integration they would be willing to allow .
Argumentative	 even member states are increasingly finding that the eu 's intrusiveness and the cost of supporting smaller economies outweigh any potential benefit .
Argumentative	 britain has expressed this discontent particularly strongly .
Argumentative	  this is a problem for the european union .
Argumentative	 the problem of its alienated member states is only likely to get worse as it seeks to continue expanding : new countries will have increasingly divergent values and will be harder to integrate while deepening will mean more countries are left behind .
Argumentative	 in practice , this means that the eu will face massive barriers to its goal of integration , and compromise all its other goals in the process .
Argumentative	 the best solution then is to go back to a stage in the eu 's development that every country supports ; the single market without the politics attached .
Argumentative	 this would bring the benefit of encouraging those who have been left out like norway and switzerland to join .
Argumentative	 the european area only consists of liberal democracies , which consistently honour their agreements .
Argumentative	 while historically a political union might have been necessary to further strengthen the coal and steel treaty , the eu as it originated , between recently belligerent states , these countries can now obtain the benefit of the trade union through multilateral agreements .
Argumentative	 they simply have to regulate protectionism and tariffs so countries can remain competitive and barriers to trade remain low .
Argumentative	 in the event that a country does not comply , the external pressure from the other countries , together with soft sanctions , is more than enough to keep the trade bloc functional .
