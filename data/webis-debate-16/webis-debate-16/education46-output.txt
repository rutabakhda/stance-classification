Non-Argumentative	2011 –has seen a great proliferation in moocs, or massive open online courses, which made university subjects available free of charge to anyone on the internet.
Non-Argumentative	 moocs are generally provided by universities, such as edx by harvard and mit, but can also include non-university partners, such as british library in futurelearn.
Non-Argumentative	 moocs platforms can either be specialised (as udacity for sciences) or provide a wide range of subjects (such as coursera).
Non-Argumentative	the defining feature of moocs is that their courses are free and thus provided to thousands of people.
Non-Argumentative	 however, moocs platforms themselves can be for-profit (coursera, udacity) or non-profit (peer-to-peer university).
Non-Argumentative	 for-profit platforms can raise revenue in various ways, for instance by raising venture capital [1] or charging for verified certificates [2].
Non-Argumentative	in a relatively short period of time moocs grew in massive popularity and are serving thousands and millions of users [3] [4].
Non-Argumentative	 some online courses have even been recommended for university credit [5].
Non-Argumentative	 this prompted to question whether traditional universities have to adapt themselves to the new realities of education [6] [7] and even whether they can be replaced [8].
Non-Argumentative	 the question of how online courses could replace universities is open for debate as well.
Argumentative	  *for footnotes see bibliographythe vast popularity of moocs can be explained by the fact that people are finding it easier to learn this way .
Argumentative	 the best feature of online learning that it can be done in the privacy of one 's home , which is more convenient than having to move cities or even countries for a university degree .
Argumentative	 moreover , online courses are inherently more flexible .
Argumentative	 lectures can be watched and tests taken at any time a person desires , within the deadlines , unlike with scheduled lectures and tests at the traditional university .
Argumentative	 not only this means a more personal approach to studying , it also provides people with more flexibility to manage their other commitments , such as work and childcare .
Argumentative	 such personal and flexible approach to learning will overtake the rigidity of the traditional university .
Argumentative	 online courses can expand access to university education .
Argumentative	 university education is based on the idea of merit - that the brightest people should be enabled to learn - however in real life many different circumstances play a role in one 's ability to attend university .
Argumentative	 the result is that lots of stellar people from less-affluent backgrounds do not even apply to the best universities due to costs and anxiety involved in leaving home .
Argumentative	 in the united states the bottompercent of the income distribution comprise justpercent of the undergraduates at top universities  .
Argumentative	 online courses allow more bright people to go to a university by definitely removing accommodation and travel costs , and , as some predict , even by lowering or dropping tuition fees  .
Argumentative	 this argument is made even stronger by inherent flexibility of online courses , which means that people can combine studies with work and family obligations better .
Argumentative	 this improves access to education for the poor within the country and in particularly for those in less developed countries , which then improves meritocracy of the university system .
Argumentative	 relocating to the best universities is a budgetary concern , but also family and social relations concern for many people , which prevents all the best people from even applying to universities that would suit them the best .
Argumentative	 online courses can recruit students from anywhere in the world much easier than traditional universities can because students do n't need to travel far away for the best education .
Argumentative	 this then ensures that universities have better access to the brightest people .
Argumentative	 for instance , stanford university 's online course on artificial intelligence enabled people fromcountries to join , and none of students receiving a score ofpercent where from stanford  .
Argumentative	 improving the pool of students would automatically result in better academics , professionals and science , which would benefit the society better .
Argumentative	 traditional universities are forced to spend a lot on administration and facilities , such as renting and maintaining buildings and parking lots , providing student support for accommodation , renting student halls , subsiding transports costs and meals , supervising university areas and so on .
Argumentative	 acrossus public universities the average administrative cost was about% of spending with the highest , at the university of connecticut at%  .
Argumentative	 all these costs can be cut or abandoned all together if universities move to online teaching .
Argumentative	 there would be no need for lecture halls and student accommodation as students would just work from home , and even professors could mostly work from home .
Argumentative	 even if some of administrative costs remain , that would still substantially increase the amount of resources to be spent entirely on teaching and research .
Argumentative	 this allows universities to improve their academic credentials and their academic output , which benefits the students and the society .
Argumentative	 one of the technical features of moocs is that content of courses can easily be shared between universities and learners , as content is freely downloadable .
Argumentative	 this is useful in two ways .
Argumentative	 first , people who are not earning credit from the course can have full access to educational materials , which expands knowledge of those not enrolled in the university .
Argumentative	 second , less prestigious universities can benefit by learning how to design courses better , so they can offer better services .
Argumentative	 moocs even offer opportunities for universities to cooperate together to offer shared courses that would decrease duplication and increase quality of education  , which would be of even greater benefit to financially stressed institutions .
Argumentative	 shared educational resources would expand access to education even further and drive educational standards higher through university cooperation .
