Non-Argumentative	anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were introduced in the uk by the crime and disorder actand have been available in england and wales since april 1999.
Non-Argumentative	 they were ‘reinforced’ by the anti-social behaviour act 2003.
Non-Argumentative	 theact defines anti-social behaviour as behaviour that "caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household."
Non-Argumentative	 they stop people from doing stated things or going to stated places.
Non-Argumentative	 they last for a minimum of two years, but can last longer.
Non-Argumentative	 those given asbos can be ‘named and shamed’ in local media, and sometimes are.
Non-Argumentative	 orders have been granted for abusive behaviour, vandalism, flyposting, and harassment as well as more the more celebrated exotic problems such as elderly people incessantly playing gramophones.
Non-Argumentative	whilst asbos are civil orders and are made out according to the civil standard of ‘balance of probabilities’, criminal penalties may be incurred by their breach.
Non-Argumentative	  their existence therefore arguably blurs the lines that exist between the civil and criminal law.
Non-Argumentative	the conservative-liberal democrat coalition government in the uk announced in februarythat it wants to replace asbos with several different schemes such as criminal behaviour orders, banning individuals from certain activities, crime prevention injunctions, place specific orders preventing anti-social behaviour in that particular place, and police ‘direction’ powers, where the police will be able to direct individuals away from a place.
Non-Argumentative	the law for replacing asbos is contained in the anti-social behaviour, crime and policing bill.
Non-Argumentative	 a particular cause of controversy has been the first clause, which defines “anti-social behaviour” as something which may annoy someone, which has been criticized as unduly broad.
Non-Argumentative	 these replacements would be known as ipnas (injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance).
Argumentative	 asbos address the symptom , not the condition .
Argumentative	 their powers are wide and undefined -- too wide , meaning that judges and magistrates can do pretty much whatever they like .
Argumentative	 certainly there are problems in the way people conduct themselves -- but if such behaviour is n't criminal , then it 's up to families and communities to fix it .
Argumentative	 the asbo is the latest example of excessive state interference in the lives of citizens .
Argumentative	 either conduct is criminal , or it is not .
Argumentative	 the law of nuisance exists .
Argumentative	 restraining orders exist .
Argumentative	 asbos are n't intended to deal with that kind of problem : they 're the tool of the state controlling behaviour .
Argumentative	 just because a problem exists , does n't mean it 's the job of the state to try and fix it .
Argumentative	 the powers granted to the state in its efforts are disproportionate to the problems concerned .
Argumentative	 indeed , the current trend is against such interference both as shown by the potential replacement of asbos and by court decisions such as one that people should not be punished for hurling obscenities .
Argumentative	 asbos are explicitly intended to deal with bad juvenile behaviour .
Argumentative	 but they encourage rather than deal with such problems .
Argumentative	 they are viewed as badges of honour that boosts street credibility amongst young gangs -- the ` naming and shaming ' just increases this .
Argumentative	 they push people that could be helped by social work or proper attention into an unenviable category of ` offender ' -- they criminalise people for behaviour that is n't criminal .
Argumentative	 `` a youth recently appeared in court in manchester for breach of his asbo .
Argumentative	 the order had been made in the youth 's absence without his being able to give his side of the story , one of the main concerns about asbos and one that can lead to misuse .
Argumentative	 the day after the order was made someone came to his house to `` serve '' it on him .
Argumentative	 this consisted of his being handed a copy of what was a fairly bulky document running to several dozen pages with no attempt to explain it or even to ascertain if he was literate enough to read it .
Argumentative	 the order included an restriction preventing him entering a particular estate nearby and another preventing him from associating with certain others .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , he went out before reading the order and beached it twice that day .
Argumentative	 the next day he went out again and breached it three times by mistake as he had not read the part covering the particular restriction .
Argumentative	 he now faces possibly custody although he has never been convicted of a criminal offence . ''
Argumentative	 the issuing of asbos is inconsistent and almost amounts to a geographical lottery .
Argumentative	 people can be jailed for breaching an asbo where the original offence was itself non-imprisonable -- i.e, a civil procedure is being used to create and expand criminal sanctions .
Argumentative	 asbos have also been imposed on people with mental health problems where treatment would have been more appropriate .
Argumentative	 newspapers are full of examples of absurd asbos .
Argumentative	 they make an ass of the law and show that the nanny state is overreaching .
Argumentative	 people trying to kill themselves really are n't going to be put off by the prospect of breaching their asbo .
Argumentative	 other examples include a prostitute who was prohibited from carrying condoms in an area that included her drug clinic , a prohibition on mobile soup vans that fed the homeless and a deaf girl who was banned from spitting in public .
