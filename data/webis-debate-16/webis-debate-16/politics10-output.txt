Non-Argumentative	cluster bombs are weapons that were first developed by the germans for use in world warand are weapons that have seen continued use in subsequent conflicts such as vietnam and the first gulf war.
Non-Argumentative	 cluster bombs are usually dropped from planes, when they hit the ground the impact causes the bomb to explode and release several smaller bombs (or “bomblets”) that then go on to explode as well, dealing damage in a much wider radius than an average bomb.
Non-Argumentative	 due to the large number of small bombs that are released on impact, cluster bombs are prone to causing significant collateral damage and often harm civilians, either on impact or because many of the smaller bombs fail to explode and do so later when uncovered by civilians who do not know about the dangers.
Non-Argumentative	while there have been no international trials specifically about the use of cluster munitions one of the crimes for which milan martic was convicted inby the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty) was the use of an m-87 orkan rocket which containspellets.
Non-Argumentative	 the icty considered this to be an “indiscriminate weapon” which was being used in “densely populated civilian areas, such as zagreb, will result in the infliction of sever casualties.”
Non-Argumentative	 so convicted martic for attacks on civilians and inhumane acts – both crimes against humanity.
Non-Argumentative	currently, eighty-four countries have ratified the convention on cluster munitions banning the use of cluster weaponry in warfare (as well as stockpiling, production and transfer of the munition), claiming their indiscriminate nature makes them similar to land mines in this regard.
Non-Argumentative	 a furtherhave signed the treaty but not ratified.
Non-Argumentative	 however, other nations such as the united states have failed to join this treaty, claiming that cluster bombs are needed for modern warfare strategies.
Non-Argumentative	the proponents of cluster bombs argue that the collateral damage they cause is outweighed by the lives that are saved because the side using them is able to bring a war to a speedy conclusion.
Non-Argumentative	from a debate perspective, the motion can be set in a general context, not specifying the u.s. however, without arguments based around opinions of the u.s. internationally the debate lacks the content to go down an eight speech table.
Argumentative	 in a modern warfare scenario , the vast majority of combat takes place in civilian areas , such as cities .
Argumentative	 whilst cluster bombs are obviously not used for peacekeeping purposes they are used in initial assaults on these areas , particularly against larger formations of enemy troops .
Argumentative	 this means that due to the indiscriminate nature of cluster bombs , in the same way as with land mines , often both military and civilian targets are encompassed in the blast radius .
Argumentative	 this is what happened in zagreb as martic was targeting croat forces but the attack due to the use of cluster weapons also killed civilians .
Argumentative	 further , cluster bombs often have a few bomblets which are duds and do not go on initial impact .
Argumentative	 the issue with bomblets is that they are often brightly coloured and when used in cities or populous areas they can often attract the attention of children who are very unlikely to know to be careful around them .
Argumentative	 this can result in significant harm to civilian populations well after the attack has been carried out .
Argumentative	 further , due to the sheer volume of duds that cluster bombs put out , attempts to demine cluster bomb bomblets is an incredibly dangerous process that in of itself costs lives .1,2,3 the international legal system is dependent on being robust and transparent in order for it to be respected by countries and states that accept it .
Argumentative	 the refusal by the u.s. to ban cluster bombs prevents the international community from doing the same within international law as the u.s. has enough political power that should it choose to ignore the law , the law itself is considered to be irrelevant .
Argumentative	 in failing to ban cluster bombs the u.s. maintains an inconsistency within international law .
Argumentative	 since dud cluster bombs effectively act as land mines for all intents and purposes , they are well hidden and cause indiscriminate damage , the fact that they are n't banned is inconsistent with existing bans on land mines already .
Argumentative	 this inconsistency within international law makes the international legal system seem less credible , owing to contradictions as well as illustrating its weakness to the influence of the u.s, this makes it more difficult for countries to enforce the rules of the international legal system , such as preventing human rights violations because fewer countries will accept international law as being legitimate and will not agree to subject themselves to those rules .5 the u.s. is one of the only remaining western liberal democracies to allow the u.s. of cluster bombs .
Argumentative	 the continued refusal of the u.s. to tow the same line as fellow liberal democracies makes it look bad internationally ; especially considering that one of the main instigators behind the cluster bomb ban is the u.k. traditionally a great ally of the u.s. politically .
Argumentative	 the u.s. is often seen as the greatest representative of western liberal democracy as it is the most economically powerful .
Argumentative	 part of this political clout however , comes from the continued cooperation of other western liberal democracies with the u.s. in failing to the sign the cluster bomb treaty despite pressure from other countries , the u.s. fails in this capacity and loses the support of the countries that it relies on to maintain its political status .
Argumentative	 moreover , given that the u.s. currently does not help with demining work , this further worsens relationships with other countries .6
