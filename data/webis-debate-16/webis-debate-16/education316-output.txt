Non-Argumentative	social networking websites like facebook and twitter are breaking down barriers between teachers and students, redefining the way they communicate and interact with each other.
Non-Argumentative	 both current and former students ‘friend’ their teachers on such websites, which often contain a lot of information on the private lives of both parties.
Non-Argumentative	 some educators have found such sites to be an excellent tool to reach out to students who might otherwise have difficulty speaking out in class or asking for help.
Non-Argumentative	 however, parent groups, school administrators, and legislators have become concerned that unsupervised online contacts might lead to inappropriate relationships between students and their teachers, and even sexual abuse.
Non-Argumentative	 a slew of sexual relationships between students and teachers led the state of missouri to pass a so-called ‘facebook law’ against student-teacher interactions through social media and text messaging.
Argumentative	 citing free speech, the law was successfully challenged by teachers unions as unconstitutional.
Argumentative	according to carol shakeshaft an expert in sexual misconduct by teachers : `` , e , ducators who use social media for personal and intimate conversations and contact are not much different from those who spend their time hanging out with students at the beach .
Argumentative	 you have to ask why a teacher would do this .
Argumentative	 the honest answer is that it rarely has anything to do with student learning . ''
Argumentative	 interacting with one 's teachers the same way as with one 's friends , sharing personal information , can only erode the respect and distance that a teacher needs in order to be an authority figure and a mentor for her young charges .
Argumentative	 even if such ` friendships ' were entirely innocent , they would still cast enough suspicion on the teacher-student relationship to put considerable strain on the teacher 's role as educator and their ability to do the job .
Argumentative	 social networking websites have proven to be particularly effective for child grooming by pedophiles .
Argumentative	 teachers are already in a position of power and trust in the relationship with their students .
Argumentative	 being allowed to communicate with students via facebook would greatly facilitate misconduct by a teacher who wants to start an inappropriate relationship with a student , by giving him virtually unlimited access to the students after school .
Argumentative	 in fact , many such relationships do involve some form of electronic contact1 .
Argumentative	 by banning this form of communication , the law would make it harder for teachers with bad intentions to carry them through .
Argumentative	 it is very difficult for a child to realize that he is being groomed ; they are unlikely to know the risk1 .
Argumentative	 after all , a teacher is regarded as a trusted adult .
Argumentative	 but , if the child is aware that private electronic contact between teachers and students is prohibited by law , the child will immediately know the teacher is doing something he is not supposed to if he initiates private electronic contact .
Argumentative	 this will therefore act as an effective warning sign to the child and might prompt the child to tell a parent or another adult about what is going on .
Argumentative	 access to a teacher 's private information and photos may lead to weakening her position as an educator .
Argumentative	 how can a teacher convincingly speak against smoking or substance abuse if students have access to pictures portraying the teacher themselves drinking or smoking ?
Argumentative	 for example , a principal from the bronx , who had been trying to impose a strict dress code at her school , was branded a ` hypocrite ' by her students when a risqué photo of her was found on her facebook page .
Argumentative	 and even if the teacher will be careful not to post anything inappropriate on her page , a friend or acquaintance might thereby undermining the teacher .
Argumentative	 a strict separation of personal and professional life would prevent such incidents from happening .
