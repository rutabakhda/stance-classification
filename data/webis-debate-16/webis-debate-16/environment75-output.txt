Non-Argumentative	global climate change, formally referred to as global warming, is the largest threat facing the long term survival of the human species.
Non-Argumentative	 the leading authority on climate change is the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), a scientific intergovernmental body tasked with reviewing and assessing the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change.
Non-Argumentative	 although debates in the media still rage over the causes of climate change, today the majority of climate scientists believe that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (ghgs), of which carbon dioxide (co2) is the best known, are building up in the atmosphere causing global temperatures to slowly rise.
Non-Argumentative	 the continued rise of atmospheric ghgs (measured in parts per million [ppm] of co2 equivalent) may have catastrophic consequences for earth and its inhabitants.
Argumentative	 while some people hold out hope that new government policy, new technology, and/or greater individual action will reverse the pattern of rising annual ghg emissions, others are less optimistic and believe that by the time humanity recognizes the true costs of climate change, it will be too late mitigate the consequences.
Argumentative	the ipcc 's fourth assessment report determined that atmospheric ghg emissions needed to stabilize at 450ppm in order to avoid a temperature rise of more than 2-2 .4 c. atmospheric ppm are currently atand are rising at a rate of aboutppm per year .
Argumentative	 in order to stabilize atppm , the developed world would need to reduce its emissions by 25-40 % byand 80-90 % byalong with significant reductions in the emissions growth rate of developing countries.
Argumentative	 only a handful of countries , all of them in europe , have achieved any reduction in annual ghg emissions despite promises to do so going back to thekyoto protocol .2 as a result , there is no evidence on which to reasonably conclude that atmospheric ghgs will be stabilized at 450ppm .

Argumentative	 developing countries such as china and india are growing rapidly and causing massive increases in global ghg emissions through fossil fuel use and deforestation .
Argumentative	 it took developed countries 100s of years to create a standard of living high enough for an environmental movement to develop .
Argumentative	 it is more likely than not that developing countries will continue to increase their annual emissions for decades , greatly eclipsing any potential reductions in the developed world .
Argumentative	 according to joseph romm , former us assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy , `` china 's growth in emissions could erode all other countries ' efforts to stabilize the world 's temperature ''.
Argumentative	 as a result , atmospheric ghgs will continue to increase , causing greater climate change .
Argumentative	 the kyoto protocol failed to reduce global ghg emissions and in the midst of an economic crisis , world leaders were unable to even agree to a replacement treaty when it expired .
Argumentative	 there is no meaningful global emissions reduction treaty ready for ratification and no reason to be optimistic that one is forthcoming .
Argumentative	 the developing world believes it has a legitimate right to expand economically without emissions caps because the rich world is responsible for the vast majority of emissions over the lastyears and per capita emissions in developing countries are still far lower than in the developed world .
Argumentative	 as such , developing countries will only agree to a global accord that pays for their emissions reductions/abatement .
Argumentative	 however , the developed world is unwilling to transfer wealth in exchange for a right to emit , particularly at a time when so many have large budget deficits.
Argumentative	 given that the growth of annual emissions is being driven by developing countries , many developed countries , like the us , believe that any treaty that does not include developing countries , particularly china , would be fruitless .
Argumentative	 increased ghgs in the atmosphere have numerous significant consequences : - glaciers , ice sheets , and perma frost will continue to melt .
Argumentative	 this will increase water levels , release more ghgs , methane , which is twenty times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than co2 and co2 , and reflect less heat back into the atmosphere exacerbating climate change1 .
Argumentative	 - the oceans , which are a natural carbon sink , are becoming increasingly acidic which will significantly damage ecosystems such as coral reefs .
Argumentative	 additionally , changes in the chemistry of the ocean could affect the amount of co2 it can absorb and process annually .
Argumentative	 - there will be increasing incidents of extreme weather such as hurricanes , floods , and record high/low temperatures .
Argumentative	 extreme weather can destroy ecosystems that capture co2 such as forests and peat bogs leading to less natural co2 absorption .
Argumentative	 these events will accelerate climate change making it more difficult for humans to reduce ghg ppms to a sustainable level .
Argumentative	 once average temperatures are above 2.5 c , events will be triggered that will be irreversible and it will take 1000s of years of lower ghg emissions for the earth to return to normal.
