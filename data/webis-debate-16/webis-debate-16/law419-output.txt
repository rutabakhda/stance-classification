Argumentative	Â suicide is a waste of life .
Argumentative	 it is an immoral act that ignores the sacrosanct nature of human life -- something that is universally considered to be the case as shown by being something nearly all religions consider to be the case .
Argumentative	 failure to criminalize such a flagrant violation of the sanctity of human life condemns any society as irreligious and immoral .
Argumentative	 nowadays we hear everyone talking about human rights ; we hear precious little about human obligations .
Argumentative	 if we believe in the moral worth of human rights we do so because we think that human life is a wonderful thing and something with which we should not interfere .
Argumentative	 whether the interference is by others or by ourselves , any action that denigrates human life is morally wrong for precisely the reason that we support human rights .
Argumentative	 we have an obligation to preserve all life , including our own .
Argumentative	 suicide is an entirely selfish act that causes immense pain and suffering for those loved ones that are left behind .
Argumentative	 it is also cowardly ; rather than facing your problems and being strong , you instead take the easy way out and kill yourself .
Argumentative	 it is important , therefore , to instil a strong sense of responsibility to one 's family and for one 's affairs and to do this by punishing those who try and fail to perpetrate this selfish and cowardly act .
Argumentative	 individual action is shaped by what norms and standards are set by society .
Argumentative	 by prohibiting suicide , society sends out a message that it is not an acceptable action .
Argumentative	 legislation is a useful social tool , in that it proscribes the limits of individual action .
Argumentative	 and by failing to prohibit suicide , society fails to add the ultimate sanction of its laws into the balance of any decision whether or not to commit suicide .
Argumentative	 many of those who have tried and failed to commit suicide never attempt it again .
Argumentative	 this suggests that many who kill themselves do so because of their particular short-term circumstances , perhaps while ill , suffering financial problems or under emotional stress , rather than through a considered and rational decision .
Argumentative	 more than% of suicides are precipitated by intimate partner problems , more than% by jobs problems and% by financial problems .
Argumentative	 given this , even a small deterrent will help to save many lives that are currently wasted needlessly .
Argumentative	 like abortion , euthanasia , cloning and genetic engineering , suicide undermines the sanctity and inviolability of the human body .
Argumentative	 it is legitimate to legislate against such actions because the sanctity of the human body is an intrinsic constituent part of the respect for human dignity , which is the sine qua non of social life in any country .
