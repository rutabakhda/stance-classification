Non-Argumentative	the power that advertising, and media more generally, wields has been and will continue to be an area of debate for years to come.
Non-Argumentative	 advertising is largely, particularly in the western world, an inescapable phenomena; from the moment we wake up to the time we sleep advertisements bombard us.
Non-Argumentative	 estimates of the amount advertisements people are exposed to on a daily basis ranges vastly from an arguably modestto anywhere up-to around 3,000 messages per day.1one of the main contentions regarding the issue is the argument to what degree, if at all, children can critically engage with advertising and whether or not it is ethical to allow corporate interests to try and change the perceptions and behavior of the young.
Non-Argumentative	 there is undeniably a great deal of advertising on television currently which is aimed at children, promoting not only toys and sweets but also products such as food, drink, music, films and clothing to young consumers from toddlers to teenagers.
Non-Argumentative	 increasingly this practice is coming under attack from parents' organizations, politicians and pressure groups in many countries.
Non-Argumentative	 the uk, sweden, ireland, greece, italy, denmark and belgium all currently impose national restrictions, and these have also been proposed in most other eu countries and in the usa.
Non-Argumentative	 within europe, the eu audiovisual media services directive has been in place since the end ofand places further restrictions on advertising to children, while also stressing the role of self-regulation among industry groups.
Argumentative	 can advertising towards children be justified, is it ethical to shield them from a phenomena which is pervasive in global culture and is arguably something they need to learn about or should children be protected from advertising messages aimed at influencing their behavior for the benefit of business.
Argumentative	advertising aimed at children brings negative social consequences , as much of it is for food and drinks that are very unhealthy with james rouse1 stating that in the us over $billion is spent annually advertising fast food towards children .
Argumentative	 encouraging gullible children to consume so much fatty , sugary and salty food is unethical because it creates obese , unhealthy youngsters , with bad eating habits that will be with them for life .
Argumentative	 society also has to pay a high price in terms of the extra medical care such children will eventually require , so the government has a direct interest in preventing advertisements which contribute to this problem .
Argumentative	 advertising specifically to children is unethical because they have little or no money of their own and have to persuade their parents to buy the products for them .
Argumentative	 rather than advertising directly to parents , companies use a `` nag and whine '' campaign that leads to hostility between parents and children .
Argumentative	 they rely on pester power to make adults spend money they do n't have on things they do n't want to buy , and which their children may well only play with for a few hours for example .
Argumentative	 advertising which presents products to children as `` must-have '' is also socially divisive , making children whose parents can not afford them appear inferior , and creating feelings of frustration and inadequacy , as well as leading families into debt .1 there is a good precedent for banning advertising aimed at children in the restrictions placed in most countries upon advertising tobacco and alcohol .
Argumentative	 it also takes a stand against increasingly exploitative marketing campaigns that ruthlessly target children .
Argumentative	 in the usa marketing companies are already offering schools free televisions in exchange for their students being forced to watch a certain amount of programming and advertisements each day , and selling marketing data on those children .
Argumentative	 it is time that childhood was protected from such commercialization .
Argumentative	 such a ban would be limited such as being only preventing advertising aimed at children rather than an outright attempt to stop children from seeing adverts .
Argumentative	 companies could therefore still advertise their children 's products if they aim their adverts at the parents rather than the children .
Argumentative	 alternatively the ban could be preventing advertising at times when children are most likely to be watching the television as has happened in sweden .1 advertising towards children can not be considered ethical as children have not yet fully developed their mental cognition .
Argumentative	 they lack the complete toolset to view advertising critically and advertisers take advantage of this , disregarding any negative effects it may have on children and society more generally .
Argumentative	 what must be remembered is advertising is sometimes much more subtle than commercial breaks on television .
Argumentative	 it can be found in many more places ; advertisers target children in schools , online with content such as product-branded games and also via product placement to name but a few examples .
Argumentative	 these types of advertising are much harder for children to be critical of as they are less overt ; with product placement even often evading the direct attention of adult viewers .
Argumentative	 in a consultation by the royal college of nursing1 , regarding product placement , it is stated that `` children are already susceptible to advertising messages and may not have the media literacy required to recognize adverts which take place during programming '' what this amounts to then is manipulation of children who are vulnerable to such messages .
Argumentative	 trying to get children to become `` cradle-to-grave '' customers is highly unethical .
