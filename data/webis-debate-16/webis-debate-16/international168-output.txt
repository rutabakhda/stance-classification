Non-Argumentative	it is clear that there are a lot of very serious issues that the african governments have to solve when dealing with the threats to the population’s security.
Non-Argumentative	  security can be narrowly or broadly defined but even when narrowly defined as protection against physical harms, such as military attacks coming from government forces or military juntas, poverty is still an issue that has a security impact.
Non-Argumentative	 the global poverty line is $1.25 a day and the rate of poverty inwas less than half therate.
Non-Argumentative	million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty inthan in 1990.
Non-Argumentative	 however, at the global level 1.2 billion people are still living in extreme poverty (1).
Non-Argumentative	 although in absolute numbers there are more people in poverty in south asia it is sub saharan africa which has the highest rate of poverty relative to the size of the population with 48.5% of the population in poverty.
Non-Argumentative	(2) so although poverty has diminished, it is still a very pressing issue.
Non-Argumentative	is poverty africa’s biggest security issue or is there another problem that is a bigger threat to public safety?
Non-Argumentative	 poverty does have consequences for security; it leaves people vulnerable to terrorist attacks and may encourage people to join terrorist organisations, something that is even more pronounced with piracy, banditry and rebellions.
Non-Argumentative	 however even if it is a security issue it may be considered to be a diminishing one as the continent is becoming richer.
Non-Argumentative	 perhaps the most obvious alternative general explanation for conflict in africa are ethno-religious divides.
Non-Argumentative	 there are tensions for resources and power between ethnicities and religion often adds to the volatile mix.
Non-Argumentative	 while there is no one overarching problem that if it is solved will somehow solve all of africa’s problems identifying the general causes of conflicts is important in working out how to avoid such conflict in the future.
Non-Argumentative	 the solution to the problem will be very different if poverty is the main problem compared to if ethnicity and religion is.
Non-Argumentative	n.b. while this debate is about africa it is also a general debate that can apply everywhere with similar conditions of poverty and a diversity of religions and ethnic groups.
Argumentative	 the examples for this debate are drawn from a wide range of countries some of which are outside of africa.
Argumentative	despite many problems that africa has to face , one of the biggest is its extreme poverty .
Argumentative	 currently more than 48.5 % of the population of sub-saharan africa lives on less than 1.25 dollars a day  .
Argumentative	 as a result of this poverty people 's security is being threatened on two main levels .
Argumentative	 on the first level of analysis , poverty can lead to crime .
Argumentative	 poverty can create desperation to provide for family or yourself .
Argumentative	 as poverty is widespread in africa , there are many people who are willing to steal , threaten , abduct or kill someone , in order to have something to eat .
Argumentative	 at 17.4 per 100,000 citizens , more than double the world average , africa has the highest homicide rate among all regions of the world .
Argumentative	  the other side of this is that a poor state ca n't provide the level of policing that richer states can , a people in poverty usually results in a poor government .
Argumentative	 this in turn means that the police force is small , badly trained and underfunded so not fit for preventing crime .
Argumentative	 on the second level of analysis , desperate people are much easier to manipulate .
Argumentative	 this makes them easy targets for military groups in africa who are searching for members to fight for their causes .
Argumentative	 it is not coincidental that we have so many militias and juntas in africa , such as somali pirates , aqap , aqim , al-shabab , touareg , mali , boko haram , nigeria , m23 and dozens of others .
Argumentative	 the militias offer those in poverty what they need most , food , shelter , and protection in return for their `` services '' .
Argumentative	 poverty provides an additional benefit for these groups due to the stark difference between potential reward , such as from piracy or winning control of mines , and a normal income .
Argumentative	 as with the drugs trade the lure of the fast buck can be used to encourage risk-taking .
Argumentative	 in conclusion , poverty both enables crime and encourages militia groups .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , there is a vicious circle , caused by poverty that many poor countries find themselves in .
Argumentative	 a poor country also means a poor , ill-funded government .
Argumentative	 such an institution is either unhelpful in preventing poverty or a road block to poverty alleviation .
Argumentative	 a poor population is also unfortunately more likely to lead to an autocratic government .
Argumentative	 this phenomenon can be shown by looking at decolonisation .
Argumentative	 poor countries when decolonised , even if they initially had democratic aspirations quickly fell to dictatorship .
Argumentative	 there are very few exceptions such as india that have managed to continually maintain a democratic government while poor .
Argumentative	 wealthy countries when decolonised are much more likely to become democracies and once poor autocracies become rich the pressure for democratisation usually becomes unstoppable so countries like south korea democratised as they became wealthy .
Argumentative	 there might be considered to be a wealth threshold about which states will become democracies .
Argumentative	  the reason why poverty is likely to lead to dictatorship is simple ; a lack of an educated , effective civil service .
Argumentative	 when the government is very small it ca n't effectively control the whole country or ensure accountability .
Argumentative	 the result , especially when civil servants are poorly paid is corruption and an opening for the army , or any populist who appears to offer a solution to take power .
Argumentative	 once dictatorship occurs it can usually be maintained by force until the population is educated and connected enough to engage in a democratic revolution .
Argumentative	 there is then a free pass for those in power to exploit their position through corruption .
Argumentative	 many dictators , including in africa have become very rich indeed .
Argumentative	 mohammed suharto , ferdinand marcos and mobutu sese seko , the former dictators of indonesia , the philippines , and dr congo , extorted up to $ 50bn , # 28bn , from their impoverished people  .
Argumentative	 a vicious cycle is created whereby the government needs money , so corruption and extortion are rampant .
Argumentative	 those in power are more concerned with their own wealth than the people which makes the government poorer and less efficient so providing more incentive to resort to illicit means of funding .
Argumentative	 poor nations find it difficult to sustain efficient and well-disciplined armies .
Argumentative	 good training and regular pay is vital for this , something that is unlikely to be forthcoming with a cash strapped government .
Argumentative	 yet such a disciplined army is one of the vital prerequisites for security and a stable country .
Argumentative	 discipline is needed to prevent the army turning on those it is supposed to protect , and it is need to secure the country from other groups both internal and external .
Argumentative	 poverty therefore enables rebellions , civil wars , and local warlords by helping ensure that the poor states involved do n't have the resources to control their territories .
Argumentative	 it should come as no surprise that ofmajor ongoing conflicts five are on the african continent , and another one if the conflict in dr congo were to be included despite it potentially being at an end .
Argumentative	  in addition to this , a poorly funded army is a threat in itself , as the lack of training of the soldiers may translate into unprofessional behaviour , such as engaging in crimes and rapes , or even worse launching a full scale coup in the hope that they will grip the power .
