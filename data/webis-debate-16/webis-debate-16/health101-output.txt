Non-Argumentative	from the point of view this debate, the status of alternative medicine raises a number of problems, as is always the case with defining terms in the negative.
Non-Argumentative	 it may be relatively easy to criticize the medical value of “crystal healing”, “psychic surgery” or a laying of hands, but aromatherapy, massage, chiropractic treatments and, notably, homeopathy are slightly harder to attack.
Non-Argumentative	 however, there is a vibrant debate in all of these areas.
Non-Argumentative	 in the same way that there are certain areas that prop needs to leave off limits for the debate to work at all the same applies, for op, to some ‘holistic’ treatments that realistically could be prescribed by a mainstream practitioner such as good diet and regular exercise or removing smoking and drinking – whether these are called pathogens or negative forces is, frankly, incidental.
Non-Argumentative	 as a result this debate will focus on those areas that are contentious.
Non-Argumentative	 critically, it needs to focus on the extent to which some of the treatments currently on offer are simply an expensive scam.
Non-Argumentative	 another common criticism is that practitioners who promote their approach as, genuinely, an alternative, rather than a compliment to contemporary medicine can be taking risks with their patients’ health, hopes and even lives.
Non-Argumentative	despite the sheer scale and duration of longitudinal studies conducted by the national centre for complementary and alternative medicine in the us (nccam) not a single study has provided firm proof for the effects that many popular alternative therapies are claimed to have.
Non-Argumentative	 arguably, of course, the moment science backs something up, it ceases to be alternative.
Non-Argumentative	 perhaps in the light of this arnold relman, former editor in chief of the new england journal of medicine commented, “there really is no such thing as alternative medicine – only medicine that has been proved to work and medicine that hasn’t”.
Non-Argumentative	on a word of caution it’s easy for this debate to degenerate into either anecdotal evidence or a squabble about the psychosomatic benefits of one therapy or another.
Non-Argumentative	 generally both are best avoided, after all if op proves the benefits of a placebo it’s not exactly something that is new to science which has been using them since its foundation and the fact that aunt bertha’s hip is much better now that she’s using reflexology is not really a point that lends itself to open debate.
Argumentative	 there are good reasons why new therapies are tested in scientific trials first , rather than just released on the public that it might work .
Argumentative	 the first is to weed out side-effects but the other is that if you give most people a medicine they will , not unreasonably , expect it to make them better .
Argumentative	 an entire industry has grown out of alternative medicines .
Argumentative	 no doubt many alternative practitioners are well meaning , but this does not change the fact that people are making money out of something that , as far as anyone can determine , is basically snake oil .
Argumentative	 the national centre for conventional and alternative medicines has spent over $ 2.5 bn on research since.
Argumentative	 the dutch government funded research betweenand.
Argumentative	 alternative therapies have been tested in mainstream medical journals and elsewhere .
Argumentative	 not only have thousands of research exercises failed to prove the medical benefit '' alternative '' treatments for severe and terminal diseases , serious peer-reviewed studies have routinely disproved them .
Argumentative	 it 's all well and good to pick at mistakes in individual studies .
Argumentative	 indeed , this tactic often forms the mainstay of pleas for legitimacy made by members of the alternative medical community .
Argumentative	 however , the odds against such consistently negative results would be extraordinary .
Argumentative	 by contrast , conventional medicine only prescribes medicines and treatments that are proven , and vigorously proven , to work .
Argumentative	 equally , the impact of other treatment which may have been used by patients eager to credit complementary and alternative medicines with curing their conditions , tend not to get a look in , neither do the relative successes of conventional medicine .
Argumentative	 the food supplements industry alone is worth $a year worldwide , with little examination of the medical impact of merrily shoving things into your system that were bought at walmart or tesco .
