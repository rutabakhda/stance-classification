Non-Argumentative	creative commons licenses are a kind of copyright license that gives people the right to use, share, and expand upon artists’ work.
Non-Argumentative	 they offer users of content significant protection against accusations of copyright infringement and are even believed by advocates to offer artists greater flexibility and profit potential than traditional copyright.
Non-Argumentative	 detractors on the other hand worry that they serve only to erode artists’ control of their work and their potential to earn income from it because of its dissemination into the public space.
Non-Argumentative	 as it is a new field, the full legal ramifications and doctrines of creative commons licenses remain in contention.
Non-Argumentative	copyright is certainly not universal.
Non-Argumentative	 for much of history ideas have been fair game to whoever could make use of them.
Non-Argumentative	 the state would grant rights and monopolies on a case by case basis but this was as a reward or in return for benefit to the state not based upon inherent ideas of ownership.
Non-Argumentative	 the invention of the printing press however meant that ideas could potentially travel much faster and made copying a work considerably easier so increasing demands for protection for the creator of a work.
Non-Argumentative	 the first form of copyright statute was adopted in venice ingoverning printing licences and fromvenice also prohibiting publication of an author’s work without permission in an attempt to prevent abuses in the printing trade.
Non-Argumentative	 it stated “it has been decreed that in future no printer in this city of ours shall dare to print or to sell printed copies of any work… if it is not made clear by original document… that the author of the work, or his immediate heirs, are content and desire that it should be printed and sold.”
Non-Argumentative	  copyright has also always been used by governments to control information.
Non-Argumentative	the first modern copyright law that gives rights to authors is generally considered to be the statute of anne from 1710.
Non-Argumentative	 it was enacted because printing without consent was causing writers “very great detriment and [leading] too often to the ruin of them and their families” to prevent this the author “shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years” with the act was enforceable with fines.
Non-Argumentative	 since this time copyright has become much broader and the length has often been increased.
Non-Argumentative	 the system has gone worldwide but is now under threat from the internet and the ability to easily share things it brings.
Non-Argumentative	the role of the state is still key in copyright as it is the only possible enforcer.
Non-Argumentative	 but the increasing unenforceability of copyright has led to calls to alter the dynamics of copyright in the context of art which could mean forcing artists to release their work under creative commons licenses.
Non-Argumentative	this examines the various arguments for a new regime of artistic property rights, in which a new baseline would be creative commons licenses rather than more traditional, stricter copyright protections.
Argumentative	 an individual 's idea only truly belongs solely to them so long as it rests in their mind alone .
Argumentative	 when they disseminate their ideas to the world they put them in the public domain , and should become the purview of everyone to use .
Argumentative	 artists and creators more generally , should not expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea they happen to have , since no such ownership right exists in reality .
Argumentative	 no one can own an idea .
Argumentative	 thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products .
Argumentative	 physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards .
Argumentative	 ideas do not share the same order of protection even now because they exist in a different order to physical reality .
Argumentative	 however , some intellectual property is useful in encouraging investment and invention , allowing people to engage their profit motives to the betterment of society as a whole .
Argumentative	 to an extent one can also sympathize with the notion that creators deserve to accrue some additional profit for the labour of the creative process , but this can be catered for through creative commons non-commercial licenses which reserve commercial rights .
Argumentative	 these protections should not extend to non-commercial use of the various forms of arts .
Argumentative	 this is because art is a social good of a unique order , with its purpose not purely functional , but creative .
Argumentative	 it only has value in being experienced , and thus releasing these works through creative commons licenses allows the process of artistic experience and sharing proceeds unhindered by outmoded notions of copyright .
Argumentative	 the right to reap some financial gain still remains for the artists , as their rights still hold over all commercial use of their work .
Argumentative	 this seems like a fair compromise of the artist 's right to profit from their work and society right to experience and grow from those works .
Argumentative	 current copyright law assigns too many rights , automatically , to the creator .
Argumentative	 law gives the generator of a work full copyright protection that is extremely restrictive of that works reuse , except when strictly agreed in contracts and agreements .
Argumentative	 making creative commons licenses the standard for publicly-funded works generates a powerful normalizing force toward a general alteration of people 's defaults on what copyright and creator protections should actually be like .
Argumentative	 the creative commons guarantees attribution to the creator and they retain the power to set up other for-profit deals with distributors .
Argumentative	 at base the default setting of somehow having absolute control means creators of work often do not even consider the reuse by others in the commons .
Argumentative	 the result is creation and then stagnation , as others do not expend the time and energy to seek special permissions from the creator .
Argumentative	 mandating that art in all its forms be released under a creative commons licensing scheme means greater access to more works , for the enrichment of all .
Argumentative	 this is particular true in the case of `` orphan works '' , works of unknown ownership .
Argumentative	 fears over copyright infringement has led these works , which by some estimates account for% of all books , have led to huge amounts of knowledge and creative output languishing beyond anyone 's reach .
Argumentative	 a mix of confusion over copyright ownership and unwillingness of owners to release their works , often because it would not be commercially viable to do so , means that only% of all works currently protected by copyright are commercially available .
Argumentative	 releasing these works under creative commons licenses will spawn a deluge of enriching knowledge and creative output spilling onto the market of ideas .
Argumentative	 it would mark a critical advancement in the democratization and globalization of knowledge akin to the invention of the printing press .
Argumentative	 the nature of the internet and mass media on the 21st century is such that many artists can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them .
Argumentative	 wider use by other artists and laymen alike helps artistic works `` go viral '' and to gain major impact that allow the artist to generate a name for his or herself and to attain the levels of earnings conventional copyrights are meant to help artists generate but that ultimately hamstring them .
Argumentative	 a major example of this is the band nine inch nails , which opted into begin releasing its albums through the creative commons .
Argumentative	 creative commons licenses are so remarkable because they can be deployed by artists to expand their markets , and to profit even more from their greater recognition .
Argumentative	 after all , the artists still retain control of the commercial uses of their work and are guaranteed under creative commons licensing regulations to be credited by users of their content .
Argumentative	 giving undue artistic and distribution control to the artists through constricting and outmoded copyright may mean less significant reach and impact of the work .
Argumentative	 the state should thus facilitate the sharing by mandating the distribution of art of all kinds under creative commons licenses .
Argumentative	 the state incurs huge costs in monitoring for copyright infringement , in arresting suspected perpetrators , in imprisonment of those found guilty , even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that , once released to it , belonged to the public domain more or less .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the deterrent effect to copyright piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal .
Argumentative	 in fact , the level of internet piracy of books , music , and films has increased dramatically year on year for several years , increasing by% inalone .
Argumentative	 this is because in many cases copyright laws are next to unenforceable , as the music and movie industries have learned to their annoyance in recent years , for example ninety percent of dvds sold in china are bootlegs while even western consumers are increasingly bypassing copyright by using peer to peer networks .
Argumentative	 only a tiny fraction of perpetrators are ever caught , and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime , it has done little to stop their incidence .
Argumentative	 copyright , in many cases , does not work in practice plain and simple .
Argumentative	 releasing works under a creative commons licensing scheme does a great deal to cope with these pressures .
Argumentative	 in the first instance it is a less draconian regime , so individuals are more willing to buy into it as a legitimate claim by artists rather than an onerous stranglehold on work .
Argumentative	 this increases compliance with the relaxed law .
Argumentative	 secondly , the compliance means that artists are given the vocal crediting under the license rules that gives them more public exposure than clandestine copying could not .
Argumentative	 ultimately this adaptation of current copyright law would benefit the artist and the consumer mutually .
