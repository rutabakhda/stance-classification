Non-Argumentative	in an age of technology, more and more information can be gathered from an individual for security measures, for example for fingerprint or iris checks at airport security.
Non-Argumentative	 while the intention of this may be to increase security across nations, some people have begun to question how much of their personal information is really needed by government organisations, and whether their liberty is as risk.
Non-Argumentative	 while the standards of identity cards may vary from country to country, nations such as the uk, canada, the usa, france and australia have all debated implementing a system of biometric identity cards.
Non-Argumentative	 in this case, each citizen would have a card with their personalised data, such as a fingerprint.
Non-Argumentative	 however, this information may be expanded to include other information such as medical records, and use of identity cards may ‘function creep’ to an extent where it may eventually double as identification for an individual’s bank account or car ownership, or even as a passport.
Non-Argumentative	 the technology is constantly growing and may some day incorporate many other aspects of ordinary, everyday life if this motion were to be implemented.
Non-Argumentative	 it is fair to assume that, under the motion, an individual would be required to produce their identity card whenever requested by a figure of authority; for example a policeman or welfare officer.
Non-Argumentative	 while it is possible for the proposition to frame the debate around a standard identification card which does not necessarily feature biometric information, this is already status quo in countries such as belgium, germany and portugal.
Non-Argumentative	 arguably these examples could form a policy for the proposition side to propose.
Non-Argumentative	 however, given that many people already carry a form of basic identification with their name on – such as a driver’s license or credit card – the debate would perhaps be broader, and bring more interesting points of discussion, if the proposition’s mechanism featured biometric identity cards.
Non-Argumentative	 these are the source of much topical discussion and invoke arguments over privacy of information, the use and safety of biometric information by the government, and the true benefit to the cardholder.
Argumentative	 identity cards could prove a key instrument to combat crime , terrorism and fraud .
Argumentative	 given that terrorists have used fake passports to cross borders in the past , a sophisticated identity card , possibly containing specific biometric information which can not be easily faked , could be crucial in preventing terrorist acts in the future .
Argumentative	 in cases where the police were suspicious , they could rapidly check the identities of many people near a crime scene , which would make their investigation much swifter and more effective .
Argumentative	 the cbi also believes that ` the creation of a single source of identity data ' in the form of biometric identity cards would also decrease identity fraud .
Argumentative	 given that identity fraud currently costs the uk # 2.7 billion per year , canada overmillion canadian dollars per year , and in america identity fraud relating to credit cards alone costs around $ 8.6 billion per year , this is obviously a serious problem under the status quo .
Argumentative	 these crimes would be much more difficult if biometric data was required for financial transactions and other activities such as leaving or entering a country ; identity cards are the best way forwards .
Argumentative	 the value of id cards in combating terrorism and crime is much reduced if not everyone has them as the guilty would be less likely to want to get such cards unless they could somehow fake them .
Argumentative	 the average person is faced with numerous requisitions for identification every day , whether trying to access their own bank account , prove their age or prove their address .
Argumentative	 the identity card could easily incorporate all of this information to become one convenient for of identification and save the user the hassle of carrying so many documents around with them .
Argumentative	 given that ` the average person now has to remember five passwords , five pin numbers , two number plates , three security id numbers and three bank account numbers just to get through everyday life ' , there is evidently a need for a single , concise form of identification .
Argumentative	 moreover , it would help them to identify the people they have to interact with .
Argumentative	 there have been numerous cases of criminals posing as company officials such as gas workers in order to gain access to somebody 's home and steal from them .
Argumentative	 these identity cards would particularly help vulnerable citizens who are the most at risk of this kind of injustice .
Argumentative	 for this reason these cards should be compulsory , they would not be much use as identification if not everyone had one that could be checked by anybody .
Argumentative	 illegal immigration is an enormous problem in western nations .
Argumentative	 the uk estimates that there are more that one million illegal immigrants living in britain , likely around 2.2 million .
Argumentative	 for america , this number could be as high asmillion .
Argumentative	 identity cards would mean that , even if illegal immigrants did succeed in crossing the border , they would most likely be found out because they could not pass routine security checks required on an everyday basis because they would not have been issued an identity card .
Argumentative	 given that illegal immigration is frequently linked to international crime such as trafficking , this is clearly a problem which we need to address in a new way .
Argumentative	 as biometric identity cards would be able to store medical data , they could be instrumental in saving somebody 's life .
Argumentative	 for example , if somebody suddenly suffered an epileptic fit , it would be much faster for medical staff to find out their illness and medical history no matter where there medical records are held as everyone 's records would be linked to their id card , allowing them to be treated faster and more efficiently .
Argumentative	 it would also be easier to contact a friend or relative if they knew the last place where they had used their identity card , allowing faster unity of family in a medical emergency .
Argumentative	 law-abiding citizens who have not and do not intend to commit any crimes should not have a problem with this motion .
Argumentative	 carrying a single card is not a huge burden to an individual .
Argumentative	 rather they can reap the benefits of convenience to them personally , alongside the added security benefit to their whole nation which will help to keep them safe .
Argumentative	 as it is to be issued to everyone there will not even be the inconvenience of having to spend a long time applying for the card as it is in the government 's interest to make it as simple as possible with mobile offices taking the relevant biometrics where the people live so as to have the least impact on individual 's lives as possible .
