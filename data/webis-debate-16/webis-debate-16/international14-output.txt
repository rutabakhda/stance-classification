Non-Argumentative	 russia has long seen the post-soviet space, the countries of the former ussr, as its special sphere of interest.
Non-Argumentative	 it has been willing to engage in military adventures within the region.
Non-Argumentative	 in response to the latest such adventure, in crimea launched at the end of february 2014, us secretary of state john kerry threatened “he [russia’s president putin] is not going to have a sochi g8, he may not even remain in the g8 if this continues.”
Non-Argumentative	 the west wants to react to russia’s military action but has few good choices about what can be done.
Non-Argumentative	 a military response is impossible due to russia’s military power.
Non-Argumentative	 economic sanctions bring the threat of gas cut-offs to europe – russian gas accounts for almost 9% of germany’s energy use.
Non-Argumentative	 this leaves the slow process of international institutions; the g8 is one such institution.
Non-Argumentative	the response to the takeover, or invasion, of crimea has been comparatively mild.
Non-Argumentative	 after the crimean parliament declared the province to be a part of russia the eu responded with minor sanction “to suspend bilateral talks with the russian federation on visa matters as well as talks with the russian federation on the new agreement.”
Non-Argumentative	 the european union however held out the possible of further action if the situation is not returned to the status quo ante – what it was before the start of the crisis.
Non-Argumentative	at its foundation inthe g6 of the main western economies of france, west germany, italy, japan, uk, and us was to provide a place for leaders to discuss economic concerns.
Non-Argumentative	 canada joined the next year to create the g7 at which size it remained for twenty two years until russia joined in 1998.
Non-Argumentative	 as the organisation involves summits and unlike many international organisations has no secretariat it has no specific membership criteria though with the general demand for members to be democracies and highly industrialised; new members are invited by the remaining members, and similarly can be thrown out the same way.
Non-Argumentative	 the institution has already been chosen as one avenue of showing the west’s displeasure at russian actions without escalating the situation as the preparatory meeting for the june g8 summit in sochi has been cancelled.
Non-Argumentative	 since russia is engaging in actions contrary to the interests of the other seven members should they no longer consider it to be a member?
Argumentative	 the intention of international institutions is to bind countries together , to ensure they speak to each other and resolve differences , and to ensure they feel they can not engage in aggressive actions .
Argumentative	 however when a state breaks these norms there needs to be a reaction .
Argumentative	 russia has been willing to engage in aggressive acts time and time again .
Argumentative	 the recent occupation of crimea is very similar to russia 's war with georgia in; in both conflicts russia used the excuse of russians being in danger , in both cases russia was there as a ` peacekeeper ' , and in both cases the action was in another sovereign country whose government did not wish russian troops there .
Argumentative	 the result is an expansion of russian influence and some form of annexation .
Argumentative	 there was no action after the russian conflict with georgia except a mediated peace .
Argumentative	 there now needs to be a response to actions in crimea ; throwing russia out of the g8 is the least response .
Argumentative	 the focus of the g8 is on economic , monetary , financial and globilisation issues .
Argumentative	 aggressive actions scare the markets -- as shown by the rouble reaching new lows against the dollar and euro -- so run counter to the focus of the g8 .
Argumentative	 russia has in the past also used its gas supplies as an economic weapon , this and acts of aggression such as in crimea are repudiating the idea of globilisation .
Argumentative	 the g8 is important because there is `` a good understanding among g8 members '' clearly when one of those members is engaging in conflictual acts that understanding is damaged .
Argumentative	 the g7 members on 2nd marchin a statement responding to russia 's aggression in the crimea stated `` russia 's actions in ukraine also contravene the principles and values on which the g-7 and the g-8 operate '' .
Argumentative	 any member that does not follow the principles of an organisation should be suspended as a member .
Argumentative	 the g8 has been meant to be a group of industrialised democracies .
Argumentative	 russia is neither particularly industrialised , nor particularly democratic .
Argumentative	 russia remains reliant on natural resources for much of its wealth ;% of its gdp and% of exports .
Argumentative	 its most recent presidential election -- that voted in putin for a third term -- was not exactly free and fair .
Argumentative	 the osce election observers concluded `` there was no real competition and abuse of government resources ensured that the ultimate winner of the election was never in doubt '' .
Argumentative	 its qualifications for membership have been questioned from the very beginning , when russia joined the g7 were able to argue inclusion would bring it closer to the west .
Argumentative	 yet russia remains essentially an outsider in the group , it does not share western values and goes its own way .
Argumentative	 european states , which make up half of the members of the g8 , have been reluctant to take stronger economic steps against aggressive russian actions .
Argumentative	 russia has warned the us `` we will encourage everybody to dump us treasury bonds , get rid of dollars as an unreliable currency and leave the us market . ''
Argumentative	 the european countries have more reason to be concerned because they rely on russia for their gas supplies ;% of german gas and% of total energy consumption is reliant on russia .
Argumentative	 if russia were to retaliate to sanctions it could seriously damage the european economy .
Argumentative	 this means that throwing russia out of the g8 or other institutions is the biggest sanction that does not have any risk of economic retaliation and escalation that damage everyone .
