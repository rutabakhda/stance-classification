Non-Argumentative	universities provide higher education to people who have completed school and most also act as centres for academic study.
Non-Argumentative	 some universities will specialise in a small number of subjects, while the largest can cover almost every field.
Non-Argumentative	 university education covers both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.
Non-Argumentative	 the definition of exactly which institutions do and do not have degree-awarding powers varies between countries.
Non-Argumentative	for the purposes of this debate, we will be looking particularly at discouraging non-vocational courses – those which are not directly required for any career.
Non-Argumentative	 this would include degrees such as mathematics or history, and exclude those like medicine.
Non-Argumentative	 (note that some subjects, such as law and chemical engineering, have both academic and vocational aspects.)
Non-Argumentative	 we will imagine a policy along the following lines: cut the amount of funding given to universities by the government, shape the funding criteria to prioritise academia and put the rest of the money into different kinds of vocational training – for example, the university technical colleges being set up in liverpool, uk.
Non-Argumentative	in many western countries, a large proportion of students who leave school go to university.
Non-Argumentative	 in the usa, the proportion is typically around 50%, while the uk is slowly increasing from 40%.
Non-Argumentative	 the long-term trend has been that proportions of people going to university increases – in the uk, this has gone from around 5,000 in 1920, to 100,000 into 350,000 in 2011.
Non-Argumentative	university education is the highest level of education which is still reasonably common, and so graduates have a certain status and respect.
Non-Argumentative	 they produce specialists in many fields, particularly in science-related careers.
Non-Argumentative	 this makes them a source of social mobility, as people who leave with a good degree are able to break into well-paid careers.
Non-Argumentative	 as well as this, the fact that they are melting pots for people from multiple backgrounds – and often multiple countries – gives young people what may be their first serious exposure to people who are different from them, and this contributes to tolerance.
Non-Argumentative	however, with the increase in the proportion of young people going to university, degrees are suffering from “inflation,” where they are too common to hold their value.
Non-Argumentative	 increasingly, recruiters are looking for skills rather than knowledge, and many companies complain that graduates are not leaving properly prepared for work.
Non-Argumentative	 as well as being bad for employers, this means that many students are – at least to an extent – wasting their time.
Argumentative	 not everyone should be spending their time in academic study .
Argumentative	 as well as requiring certain skills , it also requires that the personality of the student be suited to it .
Argumentative	 they must be capable of manufacturing a sustained interest in a subject , or they will not be able to drag themselves through three or more years of thinking about little else .
Argumentative	 some people are , by nature , not that kind of person -- they may think in a short-term way or simply not be curious about the world .
Argumentative	 it also requires a level of intelligence which some people simply do n't have .
Argumentative	 these people will gain very little from spending time at university .
Argumentative	 in fact , at some , typically less prestigious , universities , dropout rates can be as high as% , meaning students will literally gain nothing .
Argumentative	 many people are putting themselves through university despite it not being right for them .
Argumentative	 partial blame for this lies with employers -- the large number of graduates means a culture has developed among recruiters of using the presence or absence of a degree as a default filter for applicants ;% of leading employers filter out anyone with less than a 2:1 .
Argumentative	 we should discourage this .
Argumentative	 by implementing this policy , we create a different and better way to measure someone 's employability .
Argumentative	 this will make employers more likely to hire these people , and allow them to follow a path through life better suited to their personality .
Argumentative	 the courses which are generally offered at the moment are not serving students well when it comes to providing the skills for employment .
Argumentative	 65 % of businesses complain of being unable to hire people with the right skills .
Argumentative	 increasingly , universities are offering as a selling point the fact that they have extra-curricular courses to teach people business skills , but this is a tacit admission that they are selling people degrees which are not fit for purpose .
Argumentative	 solving this requires us to teach more vocationally .
Argumentative	 there are schemes underway in many areas to do just that -- to give one example , in maine , usa , a bill has been passed to improve local colleges .
Argumentative	 our policy moves these efforts from the fringes to the core of the system : isolate as far as possible the specific things which make good employees and teach those to people .
Argumentative	 this will help them get jobs more easily , and also ensure that companies are able to operate effectively .
Argumentative	 the consequences of such a policy would be good all round .
Argumentative	 universities can not take every student who applies .
Argumentative	 they have to balance the number of applications they get with both the number of teaching staff they have and the time they need for research .
Argumentative	 in the uk , almost a third of applicants do not get places as it is , and those that do often find they have less contact time with staff than they had expected .
Argumentative	 simply put , if you want to have academics doing useful research , you ca n't expect them to teach all the time .
Argumentative	 if universities have a finite number of places , it makes sense that they should be allocated to the people best suited for them .
Argumentative	 currently , universities are so overwhelmed by demand that it is n't possible for them to test this properly -- in most cases , they will take a cursory look at predicted grades , and perhaps an interview with the candidate .
Argumentative	 discouraging applicants would lower the stress on admissions departments , making the process more accurate .
Argumentative	 it will also allow them more leisure to reach out to and target students with the right personality , improving the quality of applications .
Argumentative	 forget all of the discussion as to whether or not academic courses are useful -- it 's simply not practical to have everyone do them .
Argumentative	 the best academic departments are ones run with purely academic aims .
Argumentative	 intensive study of a field requires that you are given the resources , support , time and space that you need .
Argumentative	 moreover , the best atmosphere is one in which everyone around you shares your love of study .
Argumentative	 it follows that departments should be allowed to use this as their top priority .
Argumentative	 this affects undergraduate study in two ways : students must be free to spend time getting to grips with their subject properly , and lecturers must be allowed to teach the things they feel to be most important for their subject .
Argumentative	 neither of these things are possible when you are worrying about jobs .
Argumentative	 every subject has certain parts which are more or less relevant to their related careers , but this may not be the same as the parts which are important to academic study of the subject .
Argumentative	 for example , maths students will invariably be taught linear algebra and group theory , normally in the first year , but% of mathematics graduates work in business & finance , where this is not relevant .
Argumentative	 if everyone is expected to have one eye on vocational training the academic study will necessarily suffer .
Argumentative	 solving this problem requires that we split vocational and academic study , so that people doing one do n't need to worry about the other .
Argumentative	 this will improve each of them .
