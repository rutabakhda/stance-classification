Non-Argumentative	following the horrific killing ofelementary school children and teachers in newtown, connecticut, by adam lanza using a bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle, that resulted in all his victims being hit more than once, dianne feinstein has said that she will introduce a bill in the senate to ban assault weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states has had an assault weapons ban before; fromto 2004.
Non-Argumentative	 the ban however lapsed inas it was set in motion for only ten years unless it was renewed, which congress decided not to do.
Non-Argumentative	 feinstein says that the new bill will “take my bill from '94 toand perfect it.”
Non-Argumentative	 detailed below is a summary of theassault weapons ban in the united states, which states "title xi, subtitle a of the violent crime control and law enforcement act ofimposed a 10-year ban on the “manufacture, transfer, and possession” of certain semiautomatic firearms designated as assault weapons (aws).
Non-Argumentative	 the ban is directed at semiautomatic firearms that have features that appear useful in military and criminal context and rifles but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defence (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers).
Non-Argumentative	 the law bansmodels and variations by name, as well as revolving cylinder shotguns.
Non-Argumentative	 it also has a “features test” provision banning other semiautomatics having two or more military-style features…the ban also prohibits most ammunition feeding devices holding more thanrounds of ammunition (referred to as large capacity magazines, or lcms).
Non-Argumentative	 aloln lcm is arguably the most functionally important feature of most aws, many of which have magazines holdingor more rounds.
Non-Argumentative	 the lcm ban’s reach is broader than that of the aw ban because many non-banned semiautomatics accept lcms.
Non-Argumentative	 approximately 18% of civilian-owned firearms and 21% of civilian-owned handguns were equipped with lcms as of 1994.”
Non-Argumentative	the previous ban exempted assault weapons and large capacity magazines manufactured before the law’sintroduction.
Non-Argumentative	 leaving the loophole that older guns could still be imported with the result that 4.7 million pre-ban lcms were imported into the usa fromthrough 2000.
Non-Argumentative	 this is a loophole feinstein claims would be eliminated in the new bill as "it will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession.
Non-Argumentative	  not retroactively but prospectively.
Non-Argumentative	 and it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more thanbullets."
Non-Argumentative	 however as the ban won’t be retroactive it will not take assault weapons off the streets entirely if it was to be passed; its most significant result could potentially be as a stepping stone if it were to show some value in the regulation of firearms.
Non-Argumentative	any attempt to renew the ban would be controversial, even after two large scale shootings, one in aurora and the other in newtown.
Non-Argumentative	 the national rifle association is a powerful lobbying group that would fight any attempt to ban assault weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 indeed progress has in recent decades been going in favour of reaffirming the right to hold arms not to limit it.
Non-Argumentative	 in district of columbia v. heller the supreme court ruled that the right to possess a firearm was unconnected with service in a militia and so overturned a ban in the district of columbia on handguns and init was ruled in mcdonald v chicago that the second amendment is incorporated under the fourteenth amendment so the right to bear arms is protected from infringement by local and state government as well as federal government.
Non-Argumentative	n.b. while this debate is assuming that retroactively banning assault weapons will not be on the table if it was this would make proposition’s case much easier as it is rather a large loophole and many of the arguments would be much more powerful with a more complete ban.
Argumentative	 put simply assault weapons are designed for assault , therefore their proliferation should be prohibited in law .
Argumentative	 to put things into the general context of gun crime within the united states every year 17,000 people are killed ,percent of them with guns and nearly 20,000 people commit suicide by shooting themselves .
Argumentative	 murder by gunfire particularly affects children , in total well over a million americans have died in this manner andpeople continue to be shot in the states every day .
Argumentative	 so some form of gun control is necessary and a ban on assault weapons is a good starting point .
Argumentative	 out ofmass murders sincealmost half the weapons used ,out of, were semi-automatic handguns and more thanwere assault weapons .
Argumentative	 the period of the federal assault weapons ban from 1994-2004 with the exception of, the year of the columbine massacre , which notably involved a semi-automatic produced before the ban , was also a peaceful period in terms of numbers of mass shootings .
Argumentative	 while assault weapons are responsible for a relatively small amount of total gun deaths in the usa that is not a good reason for not banning them ; any life saved is worthwhile .
Argumentative	 taking the low estimate of% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high% means 630-700 lives that could be saved .
Argumentative	 australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns , in australia 's case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced .
Argumentative	 in the wake of a mass shooting in port arthur instrict gun laws were implemented .
Argumentative	 an evaluation by the australian national university found laws saved $million and halved the number of people killed by guns savinglives every year .
Argumentative	 as new york mayor michael bloomberg argues `` we 've got to really question whether military-style weapons with big magazines belong on the streets of america in this day and age . ''
Argumentative	 police chiefs such as ralph godbee of detroit argue `` we 're talking about weapons that are made for war ... you can shoottorounds within a minute . ''
Argumentative	 in a self defense scenario the person defending themselves need to have enough ammunition to provide deterrence , however they would have to be unwise to take on several assailants so there should be little need to have more thanrounds in the magazine .
Argumentative	 law enforcement expert leonard j. supenski has testified `` because of potential harm to others in the household , passersby , and bystanders , too much firepower is a hazard '' as in self defense , the defenders will often fire until they have expended all the bullets in their magazine .
Argumentative	 to use an assault weapon would to spray an assailant with bullets from an assault weapon would be using disproportionate force that will not only harm the assailant but will likely hit anyone else nearby .
Argumentative	 even those who are against an assault weapons ban such as david kopel concede that for the most part these are not useful weapons for hunting .
Argumentative	 these weapons are `` intended to wound rather than to kill '' so would certainly not be useful in taking down a deer .
Argumentative	 moreover he also concedes `` a hunter will carry only a few rounds '' so the large capacity magazine is also useless for sport .
Argumentative	 many who are pro guns argue that it would be illegitimate for assault weapons to be banned while the police have them .
Argumentative	 police forces , however , are going to be much more likely , and able to give them up when a ban is in place .
Argumentative	 the police do n't want to be involved in an arms race with criminals to have the biggest guns ; just look at the british police force where there is little gun crime and few shootings of police officers it is not felt that there is the need to have police armed with more than a taser or even truncheon .
Argumentative	 put simply a ban on assault weapons can help reverse the arms race between police and criminals .
Argumentative	 civil liberties would also be enhanced as law enforcement agencies would not need to devote so many resources into monitoring assault weapons purchases and those who have done the purchasing .
Argumentative	 instead they would be able to simply target all assault weapons purchases as needing immediate attention .
Argumentative	 finally we must remember that this ban enhances the highest liberty at all ; life .
Argumentative	 today as justice breyer says `` gun possession presents a greater risk of taking innocent lives '' than not having a gun .
Argumentative	 yes a ban would not immediately take assault weapons off the streets but there would be significant long term benefits as highlighted by connecticut senator joe liberman `` we ought to restore the assault weapons ban -- not to take anybody 's guns away that they have now , but to stop the manufacturing of these weapons . ''
Argumentative	 the ban would stop manufacturers from making the weapons and with the legislation improved from theversion it would be possible to prevent the cosmetic changes that were made to keep guns on the market .
Argumentative	 this would mean that prices both in the usa and globally would increase as there would be less supply .
Argumentative	 one positive result might also be help to change the united states ' position on the arms trade treaty which would further restrict global supply .
Argumentative	 this would answer mexican calls to cut off the supply of guns into the country that helps make the drugs violence in the country so deadly both by meaning less of the weapons are made and by helping to cut off the route through which weapons get into mexico .
Argumentative	 a ban on assault weapons would not fix mexico but it would deprive arms smugglers of the closest , easiest and cheapest place to buy the arms used by the drugs cartels .
