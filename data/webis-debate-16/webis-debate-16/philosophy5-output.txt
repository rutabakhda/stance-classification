Non-Argumentative	tactical note: one of the difficulties with any debate relating to ideology is that, to put it mildly, they raise definitional problems.
Non-Argumentative	 capitalism is relatively easy although certainly smith would be unlikely to recognise the actions of the red in tooth and claw capitalists of modern banking.
Non-Argumentative	 however, that is beside the point.
Non-Argumentative	 socialism is even more difficult to define as it tends to be used in both positive and pejorative terms.
Non-Argumentative	 the added difficulty is that there is a world of difference between the steady social justice of scandinavia and the ramblings of the regime in north korea and yet both lay claim to the word.
Non-Argumentative	as a result it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate in to prop rambling on aboutand op extolling the virtues of paternity leave in sweden.
Non-Argumentative	 neither approach gets very far.
Non-Argumentative	 socialism is ultimately about economics, social justice and the distribution of wealth.
Non-Argumentative	the death of socialism has been declared in many ways and usually by people who don’t understand what it means.
Non-Argumentative	 however there is little doubt that the global left looks very different now from how it appeared in a pre-reagan/thatcher era, or for that matter pre-clinton.
Non-Argumentative	 certainly in the anglo-saxon world clinton and blair shifted massively on the issue of using taxation as a method of redistribution of wealth, and that is a trend that appears to be continuing under their successors.
Non-Argumentative	writers and intellectuals have spent much of the last two decades either bemoaning or relishing the demise of the organised left although they tend to overlook certain things.
Non-Argumentative	 primarily, if one were to sit down with morris or orwell and describe the world in 2012-especially the west-they would be staggered at the progress that had been made in terms of promoting the rights of the individual against those of a capitalist elite.
Non-Argumentative	 many of these battles were won directly because of the actions of socialists and others as a result of a changing dialectic they inspired.
Non-Argumentative	 since those results remain – universal suffrage, the abolition of child labour, the establishment of socialised medicine and universal education, in europe at least – does that mean that socialism is alive and well?
Non-Argumentative	alternatively, one can argue that for the most part the socialist parties of europe have hung up their red flags, gone back to their ideological drawing boards and returned with something that looks very much like market capitalism but with a few of the sharper edges smoothed off and painted a nicer colour.
Non-Argumentative	 increasingly, those who even use the word in european discourse tend to look either desperately out of date or terribly, terribly isolated.
Non-Argumentative	realistically this debate is not focussed anywhere near america, where (whatever newt gingrich may think) socialism never even got started.
Non-Argumentative	 it is also hard to set in asia where entirely different political traditions produced a range of comparable conclusions – but that confuses things.
Argumentative	the “occupy” protests that came to prominence ingive an interesting perspective on proceedings and raises an interesting question: can any of the protests – be that the occupy movements or the more sporadic anti-austerity protests, be meaningfully described as socialist?
Argumentative	there is clearly a difference between the general malaise of those protesting the result of the financial crisis and any form of coherent ideology or manifesto for government .
Argumentative	 the only people pretending that protesters in athens or rome -- or the occupy movement worldwide -- are in some meaningful way socialists are aging class warriors from the seventies .
Argumentative	 the world has moved on ; it is inconceivable that the protests of the seventies and eighties could be refought again .
Argumentative	 this issue was settled at the end of the eighties .
Argumentative	 it was n't just the collapse of the soviet union , although that no doubt played a major role in shaping the future of socialism in europe .
Argumentative	 in a globalised world the traditional ideas about class and the nature of the labour market have moved on and politics moved on with it .
Argumentative	 socialists may have won many of the arguments over social issues , but arguments on the advantages of free trade , deregulation , the role of the state , the relationship between government and industry all line up firmly in the capitalist column .
Argumentative	 even the leaders of those european political parties that still call themselves socialist tend to avoid the word .
Argumentative	 broadly speaking even the leaders of the left - outside cuba and colombia - accept the basic principles of market economics and recognise that high-tax , high-spend economics simply does not work .
Argumentative	 like it or not borders are now open and the idea that the state can control the flow of capital is a thing of the past .
Argumentative	 as a result people generally are richer and the idea that there a solid class block is simply no longer relevant to their lives .
Argumentative	 global economic forces have rendered socialism powerless .
Argumentative	 financial speculation , and investment flows can make or break economies , and the agents who channel these monies want to see countries liberalise , privatise and de-regulate more .
Argumentative	 this is being shown by the speculative attacks on eurozone countries where the markets are showing they can force governments to implement tough austerity or even force changes in government without an election as has happened in greece and italy where technocrats have taken over as heads of government .
Argumentative	 these more flexible markets generate higher levels of growth and prosperity , and provide higher returns on investment , encouraging more .
Argumentative	 countries which try to resist globalisation and liberal economic markets , as in ` old europe ' , suffer stagnant growth and higher unemployment as a result .
Argumentative	 old socialist-style economic models of tight economic regulation and central planning are unsustainable .
Argumentative	 a planned economy requires that the planners have the information necessary to allocate resources in the right way .
Argumentative	 this is a virtually impossible task .
Argumentative	 the world contains trillions of different resources : my labour , iron ore , hong kong harbour , pine trees , satellites , car factories -- etc, the number of different ways to use , combine and recombine these resources is unimaginably vast .
Argumentative	 and almost all of them are useless .
Argumentative	 for example , it would be a mistake to combine arnold schwarzenegger with medical equipment and have him perform brain surgery .
Argumentative	 centralised planning can not possibly sort through the myriad of way of arranging resources to arrive at the most efficient usage .
Argumentative	 only a decentralised price system can achieve this via the institution of private property and associated duties and rights .
