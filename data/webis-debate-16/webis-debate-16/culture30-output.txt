Non-Argumentative	according to the unesco “convention concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage”, the following are constituted as objects of “cultural heritage”:‘monuments: architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting, elements or structures of an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations of features, which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science; groups of buildings: groups of separate  or connected buildings which, because of their architecture, their homogeneity or their place in the landscape, are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science;sites: works of man or the combined works of nature and man, and areas including archaeological sites which are of outstanding universal value from the historical, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological point of view.’
Non-Argumentative	 [1]such sites and monuments that fit the above criteria are considered as part of our “world heritage” because of their ‘irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration’ for all peoples around the world.
Non-Argumentative	 [2]such sites are protected under the status quo, under unesco hague convention offor the “protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict”, and the second protocol to the above convention from[3].
Non-Argumentative	 specifically, unesco legislation exists for the protection of cultural heritage from “intentional destruction” which is defined by unesco ‘an act intended to destroy in whole or in part cultural heritage, thus compromising its integrity, in a manner which constitutes a violation of international law or an unjustifiable offence to the principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience, in the latter case in so far as such acts are not already governed by fundamental principles of international law.’
Non-Argumentative	 [4]unesco demands that during times of internal or international conflict ‘states should take all appropriate measures to conduct their activities in such a manner as to protect cultural heritage, in conformity with customary international law and the principles and objectives of international agreements and unesco recommendations concerning the protection of such heritage during hostilities.’
Non-Argumentative	 [5] however the same convention also states in conditions of military necessity, a waiver can exist and the cultural property can become a legitimate military target, so long as it is deemed that no other option is available to attain a similarly important strategic advantage.
Non-Argumentative	 [6] cultural property of particular significance and value can be placed under a status of “enhanced protection” by unesco in times of conflict meaning it would no longer be susceptible to a possible waiver of “military necessity” (as under normal protection).
Non-Argumentative	 [7] enhanced protection does not, however, place an outright ban on military actions against the protected cultural property.
Non-Argumentative	 the cultural property in question loses its enhanced protection if it becomes used by opposing forces and becomes a military target.
Non-Argumentative	 [8]in essence, therefore, under the status quo the protection of objects of cultural heritage often takes a back seat in times of military conflict.
Non-Argumentative	this, however, also concerns the deliberate destruction of cultural property during peace time.
Non-Argumentative	 state-sponsored destruction and desecration of items, monuments or buildings of cultural heritage has been relatively common throughout history.
Non-Argumentative	 more recent examples include the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas in afghanistan by the taliban in 2001, mao’s attack on chinese historical and cultural heritage during the so called “cultural revolution” in the 1960s, and most recently the destruction is shrines by islamists in timbuktu in 2012.
Non-Argumentative	[9]although unesco legislation does exist regarding the protection of cultural property, there is no international mechanism at the moment that condemns criminal acts and prosecutes individuals who are responsible for the destruction of cultural property [10].
Non-Argumentative	 if the destruction and desecration of sites or items of world cultural heritage were made a crime against humanity, the prosecution of those responsible for such acts would become an added responsibility of the international criminal court (icc).
Non-Argumentative	 the process would be one similar to how the icc prosecutes war crimes and other crimes against humanity such as genocide or mass killing and torturing.
Non-Argumentative	 the nature of crimes against humanity, according to the icc, is such that they are crimes committed on a wide scale and systematically [11].
Non-Argumentative	 for this reason, although the wanton destruction of cultural property will always be condemned by unesco, only the following two instances would constituted a crime against humanity:the decision of whether or not a crime against humanity has occurred would be made by unesco in conjunction with the icc and experts would be consulted in the field of the nature of the destruction and the value of the cultural property in question.
Argumentative	[6] ibid[7] ibid[8] ibidcultural property is important for many reasons .
Argumentative	 in this argument , its significance as part of our world cultural heritage will be assessed , while in the second argument , its local significance is examined .
Argumentative	 sites of cultural heritage often carry a large degree of aesthetic value .
Argumentative	 renowned world heritage sites like the coliseum in rome or the pyramids of giza or the forbidden city in beijing are truly stunning and constitute a masterpiece of architecture and a celebration of what the human mind and human culture are capable of .
Argumentative	 their stunning beauty alone is sufficient to warrant their protection .
Argumentative	 however cultural property is more than just aesthetically valuable -- they tell a story of human existence .
Argumentative	 everything that makes up our society , our moral and aesthetic values , our language , our traditions , our way of life etc. , derives from our ancestors .
Argumentative	 cultural property -- be it in the form of archaeological sites , monuments or texts and art , provide our only means of connecting with our past .
Argumentative	 this is invaluable because of the enormous potential for understanding different cultures around the world and how they interact and often conjoin with each other .
Argumentative	 it offers opportunities for us to learn from the past and forge a better future .
Argumentative	 recent atrocities such as the looting of museums in bagdad and the damage caused to parts of ancient babylon during the recent iraq war are hugely harmful to the international community .
Argumentative	 the loss of part of our world heritage is even greater when one realises that the harms do not only affect our present day society , but all of future humanity .
Argumentative	 the far-reaching and global nature of this harm is sufficient for it to be considered a crime against humanity .
Argumentative	 indeed , ` international practice in this ﬁeld indicates deliberate extensive destruction of cultural heritage may be included among international crimes ' .
Argumentative	  the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , icty , for example , ` places the destruction of buildings dedicated to religion , or of historical and artistic monuments among war crimes , that are part of the broader concept of crimina juris gentium , or crimes against the peace and the security of mankind ' .
Argumentative	  it is therefore evident that despite the lack of a global mechanism , such as the icc , that currently condemns the destruction of cultural property as crimes against humanity , international precedent with the icty suggests it would be perfectly reasonable to do so .
Argumentative	  ibid items and sites of cultural heritage are often destroyed for discriminatory and oppressive reasons .
Argumentative	 the maoist onslaught on all `` old '' aspects of chinese culture is a prime example while the destruction of the buddhas of bamiyan in afghanistan by the taliban inis another recent example .
Argumentative	 these were violent , ideologically driven attacks on the part of the state against segments of that states own society .
Argumentative	 the buddhas of bamiyan were destroyed by the taliban simply because they were not part of the islamic society they were trying to create .
Argumentative	 such explicitly discriminatory attacks are particularly harmful to cultures that are the victims of the attacks for two reasons .
Argumentative	 firstly because the cultural property in question has increased cultural , religious or historical value for them , and secondly because such discriminatory acts attack the very identity of people part of that cultural group .
Argumentative	 the international community has a duty to protect cultural groups , especially minority groups , from discrimination .
Argumentative	 the international community in the form of the united nations general assembly has recognised attacks on religious sites as being discrimination based upon belief .
Argumentative	  moreover , the icty treated discriminatory attacks against cultural property during the break-up of yugoslavia , as a crime against humanity .
Argumentative	 once again , therefore , international precedent facilitates the prosecution of those responsible of those responsible for the desecration or destruction of cultural property .
Argumentative	 were the desecration and destruction of items and sites of cultural heritage to be an internationally recognised crime against humanity , people would be more reluctant in causing either intended or collateral damage , in a conflict , to them .
Argumentative	 under the status quo , unesco conventions alone are insufficient to protect cultural property .
Argumentative	 firstly , it provides insufficient protection , since even high-value cultural property under `` enhanced protection '' can be legally targeted in a conflict , if it is being used by opposition forces .
Argumentative	 moreover , the current conventions lack sufficient deterrents to back-up its protective measures .
Argumentative	 for example , us forces set up military bases in and around ancient babylon during the iraq war and even used parts of the ancient site to make sandbags .
Argumentative	 this constitutes a violation of the unesco conventions , because us forces actively caused damage to the cultural property and also , in locating their forces there , made the site of ancient babylon a legitimate military target for opposing forces .
Argumentative	  us forces were not concerned with potentially damaging cultural property or going against unesco conventions , simply because there were insufficient penalties in place to deter them from doing so .
Argumentative	 by treating the destruction of cultural property as a crime against humanity , rather than simply a violation of unesco conventions , the protection of cultural heritage is seen as an increased moral imperative .
Argumentative	 making such crimes punishable by the icc alongside crimes like genocide would add a deterrent factor and make it less likely people would deliberately destroy cultural property .
