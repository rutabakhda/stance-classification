Non-Argumentative	inthe united kingdom became the third country to test and independently developed nuclear weapon.
Non-Argumentative	 the country continues to have nuclear weapons in its arsenal and is one of the five nuclear weapons states set out in the nuclear non proliferation treaty of 1968.
Non-Argumentative	 however despite having independently developed nuclear weapons the united kingdom now cooperates with the united states in developing its nuclear weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 britain’s current nuclear deterrent is maintained by four vanguard submarines with the first having been commissioned in 1993.
Non-Argumentative	 these submarines each carry sixteen trident missiles which were designed by the united states and are provided to the uk by a modification of the previous the polaris sales agreement.
Non-Argumentative	 the submarines are expected to remain in service until the 2020s.
Non-Argumentative	 inthe white paper ‘the future of the united kingdom’s nuclear deterrent’ argued that britain needs to retain a nuclear deterrent but did not take the final decision on the replacement of trident or if it is retained how much of a deterrent is needed.
Non-Argumentative	 but because of the long lead time necessary for designing and building replacements work has already started on some of the components which would be necessary for new submarines such as the reactor cores.
Non-Argumentative	 despite this the government maintains the final decision on trident has not yet been made and is expected in 2016.
Argumentative	 the trident weapons system while it may be a `` horrific part of our system '' is still necessary even in today 's post-cold war world .
Argumentative	 firstly through deterrence it protects us from being blackmailed by any other states , and in particular so called `` rogue states '' like north korea and potentially in the future iran who could threaten our vital interests -- such as closing the straits of hormuz .
Argumentative	 moreover having a second strike capability , the ability for nuclear weapons to survive a nuclear assault by an opponent so allowing retaliation , is also still necessary .
Argumentative	 it may currently seem unlikely that any of the major nuclear armed states will threaten the united kingdom however we do not know what may happen in the future and by the time a threat appears it would be too late to build a new nuclear second strike capability .
Argumentative	 currently the uk is recognised as a nuclear power by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty along with the usa , china , france and russia .
Argumentative	 all of whom are either modernising or maintaining their current nuclear arsenals .
Argumentative	 this means to not replace trident would mean that we 'd suffer a severe loss of status in relation to the other permanent members of the un security council .
Argumentative	 this would also raise questions of whether the uk even deserves its place as a member there as it would show the uk 's declining global role and military power .
Argumentative	 other countries that can be considered `` more representative '' such as india , the world 's largest democracy , now would be an obvious replacement at the top table .
Argumentative	 churchill said that the h bomb that it was `` our badge to the royal enclosure , at ascot , '' and today trident remains one of our master keys to the britain 's status at organisations such as the united nations security council .
Argumentative	 there are already plenty of reasons why other countries might be more deserving of a security council place than the uk ; we do n't need to add another .
Argumentative	 the uk nuclear weapons programme was first created in latea time when people were concerned about the us commitment to europe which was uncertain as the rise of the iron curtain had not been yet apparent .
Argumentative	 currently if we did n't replace trident and disarmed more likely than not we would fall under the american strategic nuclear umbrella which would be fair enough in the short term and medium term as the relationship is currently strong despite certain cobblestones .
Argumentative	 a similar thing also applies with the french but can we really rely on the americans to keep that umbrella extended over the long term when their interests and emphasis may shift , regardless of cultural or ideological links ?
Argumentative	 relying on someone else 's deterrent will always be risky as the us or france would not want to put themselves at risk of being attacked in order to deter an attack on us .
Argumentative	 an independent deterrence arsenal is necessary to maintain deterrence .
