Non-Argumentative	the length of full-time undergraduate degree courses varies from country to country, and may not be standard even within one education system.
Non-Argumentative	 however, around the world four-year degrees are most common, with five years or more not unknown in countries such as germany and italy.
Non-Argumentative	 england stands out as the main example of three-year degree courses, although within the uk scottish undergraduate courses are usually four years in length and this is becoming increasingly common elsewhere in the uk.
Non-Argumentative	 sincethe private university of buckingham in southern england has pioneered two-year undergraduate degrees1, but until recently this had little influence on mainstream higher education in the uk or elsewhere.
Non-Argumentative	 fromonwards the uk government began to re-examine the way in which university courses were delivered, funding pilot studies for two-year degrees in several universities.
Non-Argumentative	financial pressures on the uk education system have led to a wider debate on whether two-year undergraduate degrees would be better for both students and the taxpayer.
Non-Argumentative	this case presents the arguments for shorter undergraduate degree courses with the uk debate in mind â€“ this would mean a reduction of most undergraduate degrees from three years to two.
Non-Argumentative	 however, the arguments could equally well apply to other countries, where proposals may be for a decrease from four or five years to three.
Argumentative	 this may be particularly relevant to continental european universities, as the bologna process2 by which european higher education will be harmonised towards a standard three-year bachelor degree will affect them over the next few years.
Argumentative	universities are now under what is perhaps the most serious financial pressure they have ever faced1 - the uk government for example is cutting spending on education by up to%and allowing universities to charge higher tuition fees .
Argumentative	 shorter degree courses will help to address these great pressures on all higher education systems .
Argumentative	 by moving students through university more quickly , they free up capacity so that the increasing demand for higher education can be met within existing resources .
Argumentative	 and as tuition fees rise in the uk3 and many other countries as a consequence of government funding cuts , students will benefit from shorter courses that will allow them to graduate with less debt .
Argumentative	 if modern students are not up to the demands of higher education , they should not be going to university in the first place .
Argumentative	 the over-expansion of higher education in the last twenty years has inevitably lowered standards among undergraduates1 , as well as imposing greater costs on taxpayers .
Argumentative	 a two year system would undoubtedly be more intensive , and come with considerably less time off than the current system .
Argumentative	 this would most likely discourage those who see university as simply ` something to do before getting a job ' , thus increasing the value of a degree once more .
Argumentative	 those who left school atorbut now want to go to college are often more serious about their studies , often with a more motivated and professional approach thanor 20-year-olds who have moved to university by default .
Argumentative	 we should seek to encourage such committed students , who often contribute a great deal to society and the economy upon their graduation .
Argumentative	 but mature students want focused , cost-effective courses that do not require them to take three or more years out of a career .
Argumentative	 for example , at stafford university where 2-year courses are being trialed , director for academic development dr steve wyn williams has said that `` many of our students who opt to do the fast-tracks are mature students who are looking for a career change who are often quite used to working during the summer period when they were in employment ``.
Argumentative	 it would seem then that the introduction of such courses would encourage more mature students to get better qualifications , and in the process be able to contribute more to the economy as well as learn more for themselves .
Argumentative	 by teaching students forweeks a year rather than less than, the same amount of teaching time can be provided so that students reach degree standard faster .
Argumentative	 the university of buckingham has shown over many years that this can be achieved with no loss of quality - they remain highly placed in comparative league tables1 .
Argumentative	 at the same time laboratories and lecture theatres do not stand empty for half the year , while students still haveweeks of vacation in which they can read and reflect on their learning .
