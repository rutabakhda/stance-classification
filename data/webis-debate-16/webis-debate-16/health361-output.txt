Argumentative	Â control of one 's own body is the most fundamental of human rights .
Argumentative	 no government should be permitted to define how its citizens can express themselves .
Argumentative	 the distinction between the permissible and the impermissible should be drawn at the line of consent .
Argumentative	 this is not a novel distinction .
Argumentative	 your property can not be stolen from you if you agree to give it away .
Argumentative	 you have no legal remedy if your property is damaged by another with your consent , or if you damage it yourself .
Argumentative	 why should there be a moral difference when this property is flesh and blood ?
Argumentative	 paternalism in this instance only protects those who do not want to be protected .
Argumentative	 the prohibition of sadomasochism is simply inconsistent with the liberty that governments already permit their citizens to exercise to injure each other and themselves .
Argumentative	 when people are entitled to risk pain , serious injury , or even death in sporting activity , why should they not also be permitted to suffer some discomfort in consensual sexual activity ?
Argumentative	 the same piercing of flesh which attracts criminal liability in a fetishistic context can be performed legally in a chemist 's shop or tattooist 's parlor .
Argumentative	 the distinction between the rugby scrum , the bungee tower and the bedroom is an arbitrary one .
Argumentative	 some of the pleasure that is inherent in contact sports is derived from the adrenal thrill of flirting with injury .
Argumentative	 it is widely known that a significant proportion of individuals find jeopardy and danger as enjoyable as decadence .
Argumentative	 a sport purged of all risk would be unwatched and unplayed .
Argumentative	 comparably , a corpus of law that did not acknowledge or protect the diversity of human sexual experience would needlessly limit individual sexual freedom , and would probably be ignored .
Argumentative	 the criminalisation of s&m removes legal protection from individuals who suffer an abuse of consent while submitting to sadistic practices .
Argumentative	 where a dominant partner ignores safe words or pushes a session too far , the criminal status of s&m may lead to a victim being prosecuted alongside a perpetrator .
Argumentative	 alternately , victims may be disincentivised from approaching the police altogether .
Argumentative	 although it is not possible to be prosecuted for being the victim of a crime , individuals who are harmed during sadomasochistic sex many not be able to engage in a rational assessment of their own criminal liability .
Argumentative	 even though laws against sadomasochistic acts pin liability only on the sadistic partner , they also serve to criminalize the act itself .
Argumentative	 victims of abuses of consent may therefore become wary of informing the police that they have participated in such activity , for fear that they will be publicly stigmatized or subjected to police investigation themselves .
Argumentative	 the only time s&m can be problematic is when someone does not listen to their partner when they withdraw their consent and ask for the session to end .
Argumentative	 individuals will not stop engaging in s&m simply because the state says so , but victims of over-aggressive partners will lose recourse or protection under the law if they try to approach the police about such an incident .
Argumentative	 where an s&m session goes awry , victims of an abuse of consent will have to admit to engaging in a criminal act .
Argumentative	 in the same way prostitutes have no real protection from assault and rape due to the criminality of their acts , victims of assault and rape in s&m are no longer protected .
Argumentative	 the opposition may attempt to claim that there will be a clear distinction between a sadistic `` criminal '' and a submissive `` victim '' whenever a complaint is raised .
Argumentative	 this is not true .
Argumentative	 many sadomasochistic relationships are based around fluctuating and interchangeable roles .
Argumentative	 both partners may engage in sadistic acts at different times .
Argumentative	 it is sufficient for the decriminalization of sadomasochism that each participant is aware of the hazards inherent in the fetishes they will be exploring and consents to them .
Argumentative	 no law prohibits people from refusing to wear a condom during sexual intercourse , notwithstanding the peril of infection .
Argumentative	 furthermore , all cases where an individual withdraws their consent for the activity can be arbitrated and prosecuted like every other situation of consensual sex where an individual withdraws consent and their partner does not respect that wish .
Argumentative	 the police and courts will investigate it in the same way and will prosecute those who commit rape under the guise of s&m just as they prosecute those who commit rape under the guise of consensual intercourse .
Argumentative	 the idealization of physical beauty within american and european culture has created a demand for increasingly interventionist forms of cosmetic enhancement .
Argumentative	 women and men are prepared to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to have their faces , breasts and genitals maimed and modified by surgeons , to have their skin bleached or their facial muscles temporarily paralyzed by `` beauticians '' and to be badgered , bullied and blackmailed into complying with restrictive diets and extensive regimes of physical exertion by domineering personal trainers .
Argumentative	 except in the most extreme and obvious cases of emotional or psychological disturbance , adults are automatically assumed to be capable of consenting to these acts .
Argumentative	 further , the western ideal of physical beauty is closely associated with the cultural norms that influence and control sexual attraction , compatibility and enjoyment .
Argumentative	 the erotic is almost inextricably linked with the aesthetically idealized .
Argumentative	 the intense pain and extensive physical injuries that individuals endure in the pursuit of physical beauty are also endured in the pursuit of sexual gratification .
Argumentative	 the risks inherent in invasive cosmetic treatments are poorly explained .
Argumentative	 the expense of these products and services and the pervasiveness of idealized physical forms combine to create parallel markets comprising cheaper , poorly regulated forms of `` beauty enhancement '' , including intensive tanning and skin bleaching lotions .
Argumentative	 the ultimate objective of these physically painful and dangerous activities is sexual pleasure .
Argumentative	 even if the heightening of sexual pleasure that results from physical modification is less direct than in a sadomasochistic encounter , many cosmetic surgery patients find the aesthetic pleasure attendant on successful surgery to be satisfying too .
Argumentative	 it seems hypocritical and perverse for a supposedly liberal system of law to allow individuals who are openly pursuing a sexual objective to consent to the harms and risks of cosmetic surgery , while limiting the legality of sadomasochistic acts .
Argumentative	 both activities have the same underlying purpose , and both produce dangerous externalities .
Argumentative	 rational , consenting adults should have as much freedom to engage in s&m play as they currently have to submit to cosmetic surgery .
