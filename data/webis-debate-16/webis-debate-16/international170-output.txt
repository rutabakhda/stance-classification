Non-Argumentative	development is the sustained increase in standards of living of a country.
Non-Argumentative	 there however is no individual indicator that shows that a country is considered developed.
Non-Argumentative	 the proxy that is usually used is gross domestic product per capita which is the total amount a nation produces divided by the country’s population.
Non-Argumentative	 this then captures the relative performance of nations and usually shows how developed a nation is.
Non-Argumentative	 what it does not show however is how equally that wealth from that output is divided so it is possible that a nation that is very rich by gdp is actually not very developed if all of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of one or two people, an example of this is equatorial guinea which is considered a high income economy by the world bank yet also has 76.8% of the population in poverty.
Non-Argumentative	 dissatisfaction with this has led to the development of the human development index for the development reports of the united nations development programme.
Non-Argumentative	 these include a broader range of indicators using gross national income per capita (only slightly different from gdp) with purchasing power parity (meaning it takes in to consideration differences in prices for the same product) as a wealth component.
Non-Argumentative	 it also includes life expectancy at birth for a health component, and mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling to create an educated component.
Non-Argumentative	 the index is sometimes improved by adjusting for inequalities between the three.
Non-Argumentative	 in either case countries tend to be categorised into very high, high, medium (with this being split into lower and upper middle in the world bank’s) and low.
Non-Argumentative	 a country might be said to be fully developed when it reaches high.
Non-Argumentative	 development however might simply be taken as the movement between these categories.
Non-Argumentative	dictatorship does not automatically result in development – an increase in human wellbeing, which can be evidenced by improved education, health, lifestyles and security.
Non-Argumentative	 neither does democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 there are cases both of democracies that have failed to develop, such as india and bangladesh, and there are a lot of instances where autocracies have failed to develop.
Non-Argumentative	 on the opposite side of the coin there are both cases where democracies have developed such as many western countries; the uk, us, france, and cases where states have developed under a more autocratic system such as south korea, singapore, and most recently china.
Non-Argumentative	 it is china that is the driving force behind current debates on whether dictatorships might be better than democracies at encouraging at least the initial stages of growth.
Non-Argumentative	  there are however both advantages and disadvantages to each system when it comes to encouraging development.
Non-Argumentative	 a dictatorship has greater control over people and resources allowing for more state driven economic growth, making it in a better position to develop than a democratic state.
Non-Argumentative	 this is most evident in early stages of development where development is based on the production of goods.
Non-Argumentative	 this will explore whether dictatorships are more likely to develop then democracies.
Argumentative	 dictatorships are superior to democracies in that they can make decisions and implement policies quicker .
Argumentative	 they can easily modify institutional and legal frameworks towards development goals , as there is no need for a political consensus behind their actions .
Argumentative	 this also insulates government from special interests that must be reconciled with in democracies .
Argumentative	 this allows dictatorships to create a pro-investment legal , economic and institutional framework such as low taxes , exchange rate manipulations and import tariffs , without facing political opposition .
Argumentative	 for example , fracking , a technique used to extract hard to obtain gas , has generated widespread opposition in the west , leading to it being banned in france .
Argumentative	 an autocratic government would find it easier to allow cheap access to this energy , boosting industry , as it could disregard this opposition .
Argumentative	 dictatorships can also control resources to allow for better health and education services , by determining curricula , salaries and supplies .
Argumentative	 cuba has one of the best healthcare systems in the world , with more doctors per capita than much of the western world , and inshanghai came first in the pisa test .
Argumentative	 due to the lack of rotation in office , a dictatorship allows for a more stable government with more ability to plan for the long term , which is crucial for attracting foreign investment .
Argumentative	 given that a democracy requires regular elections , each election can change the economic environment of a country .
Argumentative	 a change in government may lead to a switch in policies , partisan appointments to government bodies , and a medium term focus always set on the next election .
Argumentative	 close elections can lead to disorder as votes are recounted and appeals lodged in the courts .
Argumentative	 after themexican presidential election , tight results lead to popular unrest and mass protests calling for a recount .
Argumentative	 the president elect had to deal with a large legislative faction that did not recognise him , and his opponent refused to concede defeat .
Argumentative	 without a stable framework , the lack of foreign confidence may impede development .
Argumentative	 the countries that have developed rapidly have tended to be those that have managed to attract this foreign direct investment thus inchina managed to get $billion of fdi ,% of the total , against only $billion for the united states which is still a much bigger economy .
Argumentative	 additionally the resources needed to operate a democratic society and run elections are a large expense for the state and society as a whole ; the us presidential election costs $ 6bn , money which would be much better spent investing in building infrastructure or businesses .
Argumentative	 dictatorships are better at controlling discipline and order within society .
Argumentative	 they generally promote a state based on hierarchical values , through strict policies based on security .
Argumentative	 this allows them to prevent financial losses due to strikes and riots , and reduce crime rates , making the country more stable .
Argumentative	 singapore is a de-facto one party state , in which the ruling people 's action party , is accused of stopping the operation of opposition parties .
Argumentative	 a former foreign minister of singapore has asked `` how many singaporeans really want free speech anyway ?
Argumentative	 they want orderliness , a decent living '' .
Argumentative	 this both makes the country more competitive because there are more productive days and more attractive to invest in as expats will want to live in countries with little crime .
Argumentative	 moreover when it comes to attracting immigration for sectors of the economy there is none of the opposition that would occur in democracies .
Argumentative	 autocracy may be the only way to stabilize some countries that have never had a democratic government .
Argumentative	 it has been suggested by mancur olson , a leading economist , that `` anarchy not only involves loss of life but also increases the incentives to steal and to defend against theft , and thereby reduces the incentive to produce '' .
Argumentative	 a dictatorship may be the only way to restore order and create a political framework stable enough for trade and investment .
