Non-Argumentative	asylum is “protection from arrest and extradition given especially to political refugees by a nation or by an embassy or other agency enjoying diplomatic immunity.”
Non-Argumentative	 asylum can be best understood as protection a country grants an individual by means of granting them ‘refugee’ status and allowing them to live in their country without fear of persecution or prosecution from their home country.
Non-Argumentative	 asylum is granted in cases where there is a reasonable and immediate threat of what is deemed “unjust” harm or punishment by the receiving country if the individual being granted asylum were to return to their home country.
Non-Argumentative	 the origin of the concept of asylum is rooted in theconvention relating to the status of refugees and theprotocol relating to the status of refugees.
Non-Argumentative	 these international conventions were further supported by resolution(xxi) adopted by the united nations general assembly.
Non-Argumentative	 the international organization that provides administrative and institutional support to asylum-seekers is the united nations high commissioner for refugees.
Non-Argumentative	mirroring a growing acceptance of difference in sexual orientation seen in most western liberal democracies is a continued and violent lack of acceptance of “taboo” sexual practices in less socially-progressive areas of the world.
Non-Argumentative	 homosexuality, bisexuality and transgendered peoples are common targets of violence and hatred in much of the developing world.
Non-Argumentative	 in many parts of the world homosexuality is criminalized and even carries the death penalty as punishment in many countries.
Non-Argumentative	 early maysaw uganda’s parliament attempt to back a bill that would make the crime of homosexuality punishable by death.
Non-Argumentative	 much of the world is an unsafe place for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (lgbt) peoples and the discussion of asylum is centred on how to appropriately address this issue.
Argumentative	 the lgbt community fulfills the most basic principles and purposes of the concept of asylum .
Argumentative	 asylum was created as a direct protection of articleof the united nations declaration of human rights , undhr ,which states that `` everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . ''
Argumentative	 this article was created in order to protect the third article of the declaration `` everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person . ''
Argumentative	 this concept of asylum was created to develop a separate category of migration that would allow its applicants to breach normal immigration protocol and application procedures on the basis that these people were in immediate danger and that without creating a specific bypass for them , they would endure great harm or death .
Argumentative	 the point of asylum as a specific and emergency measure and , indeed a moral necessity , was two-fold : 1 , the immediate nature of the threat/danger to their person 2 , that this threat was persecutory in nature what is important to note is that `` persecution '' is fundamentally different than prosecution .
Argumentative	 the difference lay in the acceptability and justice of the punishment someone may or will endure .
Argumentative	 persecution is a term used for a punishment that is unjust or morally abhorrent .
Argumentative	 asylum has emerged as a category of protection we grant to people who we believe that we are morally obligated to help , because if we do not , they will receive a punishment they do not deserve and will severely harmed for something they deserve no harm for .
Argumentative	 we , the proposition , believe that both of these criteria are filled by those fleeing persecution for sexual orientation and thus we are morally-obligated to grant them asylum .
Argumentative	 first , it is clear that they are facing immediate danger .
Argumentative	 whether it is death penalties in places like uganda or vigilante justice against homosexuals such as the murder of david kato .
Argumentative	 in places like uganda , local tabloids often publishes `` gay lists '' of individuals they believe are gay so that the community can track them down and kill them for their sexual orientation , which is how and why david kato was murdered .
Argumentative	 it is clear that whether by the state or by their neighbour , there is a clear and immediate danger to many lgbt people across the world .
Argumentative	 the second criteria of the unacceptability of this persecution is also clear .
Argumentative	 we as western liberal democracies have in recent years become increasingly accepting of the lgbt community with the granting of gay marriage , application of anti-discrimination laws and even allowing of gay-adoption in many countries .
Argumentative	 the sexual orientation of an individual is in no indicative of one 's worth as a human being in the eyes of the western liberal democracy and can never possible be a death sentence .
Argumentative	 it is inconceivable for us to consider sexual orientation a reason to not allow a person to raise a child , never mind view it as an acceptable reason for death .
Argumentative	 this will help change practices of sexuality-discrimination in nations across the world .
Argumentative	 one of the most effective ways to engage the international community on swift action to protect certain rights is to make a clear , bold statement against a particular type of behaviour .
Argumentative	 by acting to not just condemn a certain behaviour , but actively circumvent states ' ability to carry out such a behaviour , the international community sends a message of the unacceptability of such practices .
Argumentative	 moreover , and more importantly , regardless of if the countries are persuaded into agreeing with the international community on the issues of lgbt rights , this action will still change state behaviour .
Argumentative	 this will happen for two reasons : the best example of this is that due to strong and vocal condemnation of the bahati bill in uganda which would have imposed the death penalty for the crime of homosexuality , the cabinet committee rejected the bill .
Argumentative	 therefore , this policy is instrumental in changing state behaviour towards sexual orientation and making the first steps towards acceptance and ending discrimination .
Argumentative	 global consensus on progressive rights for the lgbt community will be aided through this policy .
Argumentative	 one of the most powerful weapons in the international community 's arsenal is the soft power of condemnation .
Argumentative	 one of the most important things the international community can do is use its weight and influence to advocate protection of vulnerable peoples and promote moral and social causes .
Argumentative	 the west with its immense wealth and importance in international institutions such as the united nations have a lot of power when it comes to influencing discriminatory policies in other nations .
Argumentative	 granting asylum to people on the basis of sexual orientation sends a clear message to the international community that it is not okay to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation and that the west not only strongly disapproves of this behaviour , but that , more importantly , they will take active steps to counter-act your discriminatory policies .
Argumentative	 this has immense impact on pressuring governments to change their policies .
Argumentative	 what is important to note here is that there is a gradual normative consensus that is manufactured under this system .
Argumentative	 through the use of soft power , the policies of nations are slowly but surely moderated and a global consensus is created .
Argumentative	 not only can this policy influence current state behaviour , but that the influence and change that creates becomes part of a larger global move towards universal acceptance of the norm and the diffusion of that idea throughout all strata of society .
Argumentative	 this is important in two ways : making sexual orientation a category for asylum not only saves lives , but also sends a strong and influential message that helps craft policy in nations who use discrimination as a tool of oppression against the lgbt community .
Argumentative	 this begins the foundations of global consensus on equality for all sexual orientations and a lasting solution to the issue of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation .
