Non-Argumentative	the topic of tolerance towards religious symbols has caused much controversy among many both in the western and eastern hemispheres.
Non-Argumentative	 religious symbols are incorporated into every religion and are expressions of both faith and devotion.
Non-Argumentative	 examples of religious symbols include the christian, particularly catholic, crucifix, the muslim hijab and the sikh kirpan.
Non-Argumentative	 for many people, particularly from the west, the hijab or muslim head covering symbolises the repressive and extremely regressive character of islam.
Non-Argumentative	 however, for its supporters, it represents the defence of women's modesty against the assault of modern society.
Non-Argumentative	 in this way, religious symbols and their meanings and consequences differ depending on cultural perception.
Non-Argumentative	 recent controversy has arisen around france's plan to ban the hijab, along with other visible religious symbols, in schools.
Non-Argumentative	 france's secular constitution provides the grounds for excluding religion from their schools.
Non-Argumentative	 however it is not just western countries who have taken this approach.
Non-Argumentative	 turkey has for many years suppressed the hijab in schools, public buildings and among employees of the state.
Non-Argumentative	 in the aftermath of 9/11, many minority muslim communities in western countries view attacks on the hijab as part of a wider attack on islam conducted in tandem with the 'war on terror'.
Non-Argumentative	 in a similar way, there is anxiety as to the freedom to bring sikh kirpans' to school because they are ceremonial daggers.
Non-Argumentative	 it should be noted that the sikh religion requires the kirpan to carried with the sikh at all times.
Non-Argumentative	 in this way, the practice of the religion is seen to be restricted and can, therefore, be possibly considered as discrimination.
Non-Argumentative	 however, there are other forms of religious symbolism that are not necessarily a requirement of the religion and are merely an expression of faith.
Non-Argumentative	 there was recent controversy over a british woman who lost her job simply because she continued wearing a crucifix after she was told not to by her employers.
Non-Argumentative	 all of these points present an interesting question.
Non-Argumentative	 should authorities be more lenient on religious symbols that are a requirement of the person?
Argumentative	 also, should there be a limit to physical or material expressions of faith?
Argumentative	religious symbols are seen to , in some cases , increase the equality divide between genders .
Argumentative	 as an example , the muslim hijab is considered by some as a very powerful symbol for the oppression of women , particularly in countries such as saudi arabia or afghanistan where it is compulsory .
Argumentative	 therefore , when it is worn in western countries that encourage democracy and equality , the wearing of the hijab is seen as almost counter-productive to the goals of democratic society .
Argumentative	 for this reason belgium has recently banned the wearing of the full muslim veil , much like france in 2010.1 often muslim dress rules for women are seen as more severe than those for men .
Argumentative	 inequality between men and women is a form of discrimination and liberal societies should fight all forms of discrimination .
Argumentative	 as well as division in society in general , religious symbols are also a source of division within school environments .
Argumentative	 the hijab causes schools many problems .
Argumentative	 it is potentially divisive in the classroom , marking some children out as different from the others and above the rules that the school enforces for everyone else .
Argumentative	 this may lead to alienation and bullying .
Argumentative	 full headscarves may also be impractical or dangerous in some lessons , for example pe , swimming , or in technology and science lessons where machinery is being operated .
Argumentative	 in the same way , there have been discussions as to whether to ban the display of crucifixes in public classrooms .
Argumentative	 authorities in italy have followed through with the ban saying that such a christian symbol segregates those who are not christian .1 religious symbols can be seen as possible tools for fuelling division within society .
Argumentative	 when some women wear the hijab it creates pressure on other muslim women to also cover their heads .
Argumentative	 pressure comes both socially from wanting to look like other women in their community and religiously from imams and family leaders pressing for observance .
Argumentative	 as such , muslims themselves are divided and religious oppression against women is internalized .1 approving of muslim head coverings in society cements the hijab as an essential tenet of islam , in the minds of non-muslims as well as believers .
Argumentative	 however , many different schools of islam exist and as on other issues , they often disagree how to interpret the koran 's dress prescriptions .
Argumentative	 moderate interpretations accept modest forms of modern dress while severe interpretations require full covering with the burka or similar veil .
Argumentative	 banning the veil furthers the cause of moderate interpretations and prevents the entrenchment of severe interpretations .
Argumentative	 a ban would be simple to create and enforce .
Argumentative	 religious symbols are for the most part meant to be shown therefore it is simple for police or authorities to check that someone is not wearing them .
Argumentative	 there are many societies that have had bans on a religious symbol in public buildings , for example in france where there is a ban on religious symbols in schools has been in force since.
Argumentative	 in france the ban is made even easier to enforce by restricting it to ` conspicuous ' religious apparel .1 moreover when the ban is only when entering public buildings it can be enforced by the teacher , or the building 's security guards rather than being an issue for the police to deal with .
Argumentative	 many societies are founded on secular values that do not permit the sponsorship of any religion by the state .
Argumentative	 british society aspires to this and has consciously acted to separate religion from state authority with many organisations such as the national secular society encouraging the suppression of any religious expression in public places .1 in this climate it is important that all citizens of the state are seen as equal .
Argumentative	 if some dress differently to others , deliberately identifying themselves as members of one religion , this can harm the unity and ethos of the state .
Argumentative	 this holds particularly true for institutions of the state like schools and government offices .
Argumentative	 in this way , it is possible to deduce that religious symbols are detrimental to the secular and equality focused identity of western society .
