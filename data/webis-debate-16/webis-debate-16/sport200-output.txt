Non-Argumentative	with the olympics fast approaching, we must ask, what is the price of gold?
Non-Argumentative	 professional athletes already sacrifice huge amounts in order to earn the ultimate prize, but some athletes endure untold hardships and abuse to get there.
Non-Argumentative	 particularly prevalent in gymnastics but present in other sports, athletes have been beaten, starved, physically and mentally abused and forced into unusually cruel and inhospitable environments in the name of ‘training’.
Non-Argumentative	  these allegations tend to be directed towards romania, china and russia, although scandals have hit other countries.
Non-Argumentative	 this house asks, should we allow this to go on?
Non-Argumentative	 if not, is banning countries from participating if they do opt to subject their athletes to these methods the fairest or most successful means of tackling the issue?
Non-Argumentative	if the policy were to come into place, it’d likely come from the international association of athletics federation (iaaf), who are the central body who currently rule upon international athletics.
Non-Argumentative	 the policy would ban nations found guilty of using these techniques, indefinitely, until investigations are complete and evidence of reform is shown.
Non-Argumentative	 that would be a definite change from the status quo where trainers are rarely exposed, and when they are, very little tends to happen.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, despite the famous gymnastic coaches, béla and márta károlyi, receiving multiple accusations of abuse, the couple are still prominent members of the gymnastics community and marta károlyi is the current usa team coordinator.
Non-Argumentative	 under this rule, if the karolyis were found guilty, the nation they coached would be banned from competing in the upcoming games and it’d be the responsibility of the nation to put in the necessary procedures to ensure abuses don’t happen again.
Non-Argumentative	 the definition could go ‘hard-line’ and ban the entire country, including athletes who aren’t in the team where the abuses occurred, or could focus bans upon individual national teams.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, if abuses were found in the australian javelin team, you could either ban the javelin team from the olympics, or the entire nation of australia and all their teams.
Non-Argumentative	 let’s assume we’re going hardline.
Non-Argumentative	the policy is drastic, but so are the scandals and allegations of abuse.
Non-Argumentative	 so, how do we proceed?
Argumentative	 this measure introduces a strong deterrent against those who allow and facilitate abusive training methods .
Argumentative	 firstly , it incentivises national athletic and sporting bodies to diligently check the background of coaches before their employment and continue to investigate them throughout the year .
Argumentative	 it is now in the interest of every single member of national sporting bodies and teams to ensure abuse does n't continue .
Argumentative	 in most it is currently in your interest to keep quiet , lest you risk disturbing the national programme or being ostracised by your federation .
Argumentative	 as a result coaches are far less likely to think these training methods will help them achieve success .
Argumentative	 since it could see their athletes banned from the competition and lose their medals it makes using harsh training methods an immense risk to take .
Argumentative	 it would also mean they 're unlikely to ever get hired again if caught .
Argumentative	 this ban is , admittedly , highly punitive and may be called harsh .
Argumentative	 it will punish hundreds of athletes and coaches who are n't implicated in cases of abuse .
Argumentative	 yet , on a balance of harms , the disappointment those people feel ca n't be compared to the suffering of an athlete who is beaten and starved and conditioned into a mode of thinking where they accept this without putting up a fight .
Argumentative	 according to melanie lang of metropolitan university harsh and over intensive training `` removes the element of fun that first attracts so many youngsters to sport .
Argumentative	 it can inhibit bone growth , cause physical and mental burnout and increase the potential for injury and dropout . ''
Argumentative	 and worse the coercion can lead to injury and even death ; american gymnast christy henrich became anorexic and as a result died weighing only 3st 5lb while chinese gymnast sang lan was paralysed after being cajoled into attempting a vault .
Argumentative	 it 's more important to ensure all athletes can train in a safe environment free from physical and mental abuse , than it is to safeguard against the disappointment of professional athletes who want to compete .
Argumentative	 given that there are major sporting events annually or bi-annually , usually , it 's not as if those forced to miss out ca n't compete again soon .
Argumentative	 athletes dedicate their lives to their sport and becoming the world 's best at what they do .
Argumentative	 they are willing to put their body and minds through all sorts of punishment to do this .
Argumentative	 as such , they 're not in a position to judge what is and is n't an acceptable training method .
Argumentative	 if they 're told that starvation makes them more likely to win gold then their intense desire for olympic glory often clouds their judgment and ability to make rational choices for themselves .
Argumentative	 their coaches are authority figures who assumed to have their best interests in mind , and most athletes also assume their coaches know more than them about how to achieve glory .
Argumentative	 so , if a gymnastics coach tells her athlete that she needs to starve herself to win gold , the athlete will think themselves a bad athlete if they refuse .
Argumentative	 this is shown by the long history of drug use in the olympics where both coaches and athletes know it is wrong to use drugs but still do so in the hope it will bring them gold .
Argumentative	 because of this , the iaff has to make this decision for them .
Argumentative	 it also means that the chance of whistleblowing is low , since athletes can not rationally consider whether the training methods are acceptable .
Argumentative	 so it has to set an incredibly punitive deterrent to make sure coaches are n't tempted to use a training method they probably wo n't be caught for .
Argumentative	 just as an employer has a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees , the iaaf has a duty to provide a safe environment for their athletes .
Argumentative	 the sports medical team is responsible for ` preventing illness and injury ' , clearly something that is caused by harsh training .
Argumentative	 as do all those who are involved in sports .
Argumentative	 these athletes only exist in a professional capacity because bodies created the positions for the athletes to exist .
Argumentative	 if the world wants to pay people to perform and compete for them , then once that offer is made they have a moral duty to ensure that work is safe , since they are culpable in creating that work .
Argumentative	 moreover , we give the iaaf power in the promise that by giving up localised power of judgement over sport , they can better protect athletes and creating a fairer sporting environment .
Argumentative	 abusive training methods are a huge failure on the part of the iaaf and as such they must use the most powerful disincentive possible to them .
