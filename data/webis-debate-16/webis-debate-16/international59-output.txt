Non-Argumentative	mobility remains a key factor for development - a means of enabling the development of economic markets at a local, national, and regional scale (wdr, 2009).
Non-Argumentative	 the world bank classifies africa as a continent that remains largely ‘immobile’.
Non-Argumentative	 borders are identified as a key restriction in africa.
Non-Argumentative	 an interactive tool by the guardian shows how africa remains the least connected continent in terms of air travel (the guardian, 2014).
Non-Argumentative	 further, when considering the global geography of airlines - a key part of globalisation - african cities and nations remain embedded in the past with expensive, lengthy, and infrequent, air transport.
Non-Argumentative	 however new opportunities are arising and the number of airlines operating within africa has risen.
Non-Argumentative	open skies is a policy tool used to liberalise air travel.
Non-Argumentative	 the eu-us transatlantic agreement can be used as an example.
Non-Argumentative	 the eu-us open sky agreements treaty has two components.
Non-Argumentative	 the first – in 2007, liberalised air travel on both sides, enabling any us and european airline to have open access to any airports within the eu and us.
Non-Argumentative	 british airways and virgin atlantic no longer hold the monopoly on who can fly between london and new york.
Non-Argumentative	 the objectives of the first component of the treaty included changes for consumers and suppliers in the aviation industry: promoting freedom for aviation investors, enabling greater transatlantic integration, and a healthier aviation industry.
Non-Argumentative	 additionally the treaty was predicted to generate more airline passengers, jobs, and a rise in tourist numbers.
Non-Argumentative	 the second component of the treaty – signed in 2010, set to remove restrictions and regulations on the foreign ownership of airlines.
Non-Argumentative	the open sky agreement has been justified as being beneficial to passengers and airline companies, creating competitive prices, frequent travel options, and a reinvigorated market.
Non-Argumentative	 agreements are presented as a win-win situation.
Non-Argumentative	 in africa the closest policy to open skies is the yamoussoukro decision (1999), calling for fewer restrictions on cross-border travel and the liberalisation of intra-african air transport rather than protection of national carriers.
Non-Argumentative	 the commitment was signed byafrican nations, however implementation results are lagging.
Non-Argumentative	however, the benefits identified remain largely political and economic.
Non-Argumentative	 to what extent is a social and environmental perspective required to enable a more realistic picture?
Non-Argumentative	 as suggestions are being made to implement and construct an open sky agreement across the african continent – to create a competitive aviation industry and improve integration – who will benefit and how sustainable are the proposals?
Argumentative	 this explores arguments for and against an open sky agreement both within the african continent and globally.
Argumentative	the introduction of a pan-african open sky agreement will ensure competition .
Argumentative	 a competitive airline industry will have a cumulative effect on prices and safety standards .
Argumentative	 first , prices will be reduced as the market is no longer monopolised by a few airlines .
Argumentative	 currently national governments are able to place strict regulations , high fuel and passenger taxes on airlines .
Argumentative	 liberalising the industry would mean that airlines are increasingly controlled by the hand of the market , not the state .
Argumentative	 competitive airline prices will ensure air travel is no longer exclusively an elite luxury .
Argumentative	 secondly , introducing new competition will force airlines to implement higher standards - of service and safety .
Argumentative	 power is redistributed to the consumer and traveller , who are able to pick and choose the best service .
Argumentative	 therefore the companies need to be on the top of their game .
Argumentative	 evidence in europe has shown the competitiveness of liberalisation , resulting in the rise of cheap air travel .
Argumentative	 such low-cost carriers now account for a third of intra-eu travel , ecmt  .
Argumentative	 the aviation industry is vital for economic growth for bringing africa into the positive side of globalisation .
Argumentative	 the state-owned ethiopian airlines enterprise is one example of a success story for an african airline .
Argumentative	 ethiopian airlines has the greatest amount of traffic as a result of air traffic liberalisation .
Argumentative	 the returns gained from ethiopian airlines have been central to promoting ethiopia 's national growth strategy .
Argumentative	 governments can only gain from liberalisation in multiple sectors , including airlines .
Argumentative	 liberalisation , and deregulation , of airlines acts creates cumulative causation , where one event causes multiple changes , for tourism , production networks , jobs , and infrastructure development .
Argumentative	 in ethiopia , air networks are building industries and the pushing regions economic development .
Argumentative	 in kenya 's case , deregulation of airlines may improve the speed and availability of key global commodities , such as tourism , and flowers - booming industries that require rapid transport .
Argumentative	 in africa% of tourism-related jobs are supported directly by the aviation industry , world bank  .
Argumentative	 introducing a treaty whereby flights are liberalised across africa , and foreign airlines incorporated , will provide benefits for africa .
Argumentative	 for example , foreign companies will be able to tackle gaps in the market .
Argumentative	 currently there is a lack of direct flights between key destinations .
Argumentative	 direct flights mean direct interconnections to desired ; and new , places .
Argumentative	 for example , with new business opportunities emerging in nigeria a direct flight connecting cape town and lagos requires investment .
Argumentative	 air traffic in the eu is a positive example .
Argumentative	 as a result of deregulation budget airlines have expanded throughout the continent eu air traffic and new flight routes introduced .
Argumentative	 there has been a% increase of intra-eu routes and% increase in the number of routes provided by at least two companies , ecmt  .
