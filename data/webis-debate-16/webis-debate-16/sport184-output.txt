Non-Argumentative	undoubtedly, international competitions are by far the most popular and prestigious tournaments throughout the world of sports.
Non-Argumentative	 for decades, countries have tried to prove their supremacy on this stage, but in order to do that they need their most talented players available.
Non-Argumentative	 in the light of recent events, like an episode involving samuel eto’o who refused to play for cameroon’s national football team, questions have been raised regarding the duty of an individual to represent their country at an international level.
Non-Argumentative	 some say that the participation should be mandatory, while others claim that even if the players have a moral duty, the decision is entirely in their own hands.
Non-Argumentative	 some federations, like the polish volleyball association are currently considering fines for not wanting to represent your country(1), so this phenomenon might escalate in the near future.
Non-Argumentative	 as far as punishments are concerned, they could range from fines to more severe ones like excluding athletes from national competitions, and so on.
Non-Argumentative	 this would always be at the discretion of the national sports associations and might differ from case to case as well as between sports.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover, another pressing point of interest regarding this topic is whether sportsmen should be allowed to represent a country with which they have very loose ties with(a distant relative or have only lived there a short time), thus allowing countries to virtually buy their services or if this should be forbidden.
Argumentative	  as “naturalizing players” becomes more and more often in the world of sports, this issue might be the topic of a fierce debate in the future.
Argumentative	it is clear that any individual , no matter his chosen area of expertise needs the appropriate environment to achieve his maximum potential .
Argumentative	 the people involved in professional sports are no exception .
Argumentative	 they need coaches to guide them , stadiums in which to practice , sponsorship and funding to allow participation at some competitions .
Argumentative	 any person who succeeded in making a career in sports partly owes it to the society he grew up in that provided these facilities and opportunities .
Argumentative	 let us not forget that especially in poor areas , most of the sports trainings are done `` pro bono '' by good samaritans who want to lend a hand .
Argumentative	 therefore , as other people invested in their development , every sportsman has the moral duty to pass on that help , and also lend a helping hand towards those who were n't as privileged .
Argumentative	 representing the nation is a part of this moral duty to repay that which the country has given .
Argumentative	 this improves the image of that country and allows it to get the recognition in deserves for bringing up such talented players .
Argumentative	 cristiano ronaldo is one of best paid soccer players in the world and mainly got to where he is due to his talent , determination and countless hours on the pitch .
Argumentative	 but he was also born in portugal , where he took advantage of the entire football industry that exists there .
Argumentative	 if he had been born in sri lanka , his talent would have gone unnoticed .
Argumentative	 undoubtedly , one of the most important things for a professional sportsperson is to have a long , healthy and fulfilling career .
Argumentative	 no matter what a sportspersons motivation is , whether it is the pleasure from winning or the money a player always needs to be in top form .
Argumentative	 playing on the international level helps athletes improve themselves .
Argumentative	 first of all , no matter of sport , the level of the sport is much more intense when it is international , as obviously , the best players are taking part in it .
Argumentative	 santos vs boca juniors have always been very thrilling football matches , but none of them compare with the matches between brazil and argentina .
Argumentative	 if you , as an athlete , are forced to play in a much more competitive environment , then you have to bring your a-game to the pitch on every single occasion as the stakes are high every single time .
Argumentative	 in time , this improves skills and develops capabilities , as you are challenged on regular basis .
Argumentative	 second of all , when it comes to team sports a lot of scouts are watching internationals in the hopes of spotting new potential talents for big teams .
Argumentative	 this can be a very good opportunity for players to get noticed and to receive the credit they deserve .
Argumentative	 for example luis suarez transferred to liverpool for # 22.8 million in januaryshortly after theworld cup ,  while alex furgeson noted on having bought javier hernández '' if we had waited until after the world cup we would have had to pay maybe three times the price ''  .
Argumentative	 if they fail to seize the opportunity , players are much more likely to remain unnoticed and unknown outside their own country .
Argumentative	 it is in their interest to be in the spotlight for the greatest amount of time , and there is no bigger stage than international competitions .
Argumentative	 it is not just the player or athlete who benefits from taking part in international competitions but the nation as well .
Argumentative	 every nation wants to do well in international sporting completions and every national wants their nation to do well internationally .
Argumentative	 every country wants all of their best sportspeople to take part so that they have as much success as possible .
Argumentative	 this is partially about prestige ; jamaica is perhaps best known worldwide at the moment as a result of the fame of usain bolt and other successful sprinters , if it was not known for this it might instead be known for its gang wars and murder which is not what a country wants people to think of when their country is mentioned .
Argumentative	  but it is also about the economy .
Argumentative	 countries that do well in international competitions may get an economic boost as a result .
Argumentative	 economists suggested that winning the world cup could have a positive impact of between 0.25 and 0.5 % , which if it is in the context of near zero growth can be a big impact .
Argumentative	 this is a result of the feel-good factor from the victory .
Argumentative	 and we must not forget that feel-good factor itself ; wining international competitions , or even just individual events lifts the mood of the country .
Argumentative	 and if a country is successful in a sport then that sport provides an opportunity to bring social benefits through social programs to reduce violence or campaigns such as that against racism .
Argumentative	  success is however something which is much more likely if a country is able to field its best athletes and players internationally .
