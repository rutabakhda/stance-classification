Non-Argumentative	think tanks are a modern phenomenon, where high profiling intellectuals are given a free role to discover, investigate and solve important issues in order to affect public policy.
Non-Argumentative	 the purpose of a think tank is to provide expert advice and ideas on economic or political problems; usually a think tank has a particular area of expertise and focuses their study on that area.
Non-Argumentative	 their purpose is then not to propagate a political agenda but to look at facts, ideas, and possible new policies.
Non-Argumentative	 in practice however this results in particular think tanks promoting policies that have a particular political orientation.
Non-Argumentative	despite the political leanings of some think tanks are often elevated to a status of impartial enlightenment and their voice has great impact on the paradigm and on public discourse.
Non-Argumentative	 they publish academic material, hold seminars, and appear as authorities on particular areas in the media.
Non-Argumentative	 however, lately, voices are being raised calling for their increased transparency on their sources of funding.
Non-Argumentative	 of particular note the eu administration and anti-fraud commissioner siim kallas argued that as think tanks play a clear role in eu policymaking they should sign up to the european commission's voluntary lobbyists register.
Non-Argumentative	 this would not require complete details of their funding but would require they “declare the interests, objectives or aims promoted and, where applicable, specify the clients or members whom they represent”.
Non-Argumentative	the model for think tanks disclosing their funders would require organisations to make public all contributions that constitute a significant portion of the organisations’ budget.
Non-Argumentative	 this can take the form of a percentage, e.g. 1% of their budget.
Non-Argumentative	 this would make them unable to receive anonymous donations over this sum.
Non-Argumentative	 the major funders would then have to be disclosed along with any research they funded and would be on the think tank’s website.
Argumentative	 democracies rely on transparency .
Argumentative	 our commitment to transparency means surrendering part of our autonomy for the collective .
Argumentative	 this does not mean that our autonomy does not still belong to us ; the institutions that affect our lives are under a constant obligation to justify their decisions and existence in relation to us .
Argumentative	 i do not have a right to know everything about the local football club , if i do n't play football and they are not a public company their decisions do n't affect me .
Argumentative	 think tanks , however , are highly influential , and directly affect the society in which we live : some have , for example , lobbied successfully against action to prevent global warming .
Argumentative	 therefore they are to be considered a power in society , and the principle of transparency must be extended to them .
Argumentative	 think tanks are considered more credible than corporate marketing .
Argumentative	 in the case of corporate marketing the recipient is aware that he is being sold a product .
Argumentative	 in the case of think tanks , the recipient believes he is being given unbiased information .
Argumentative	 therefore , it is tempting for corporations to finance think tanks and encourage them to reach the conclusions that they otherwise would promote through marketing .
Argumentative	 this way , think tanks can be powerful tools for promoting a biased agenda : if done successfully the same message is communicated but in the form of credible information rather than manipulative marketing .
Argumentative	 in fact , it is common practice for journalists to quote think tanks without labelling their political bias .
Argumentative	 and they most certainly do n't say if there is funding from a particular interest for example with the supposedly free market institute of public affairs in australia that somehow ends up arguing for government investment and intervention in northern australia -- a position suspiciously close to several big mining companies .
Argumentative	 this violates people 's freedom to make an informed decision , and can give biased views disproportionate and undue influence .
Argumentative	 by forcing them to disclose , any corruption or bias will become obvious to all .
Argumentative	 non-disclosure can be perceived as objectivity .
Argumentative	 it is easier for the public to criticise a think tank that is openly associated with a particular funder .
Argumentative	 that kind of prejudice is stronger than the more general the prejudice against non-disclosure .
Argumentative	 a person might distrust a non-transparent think tank , but dislike a think tank that is funded by an organisation they are already prejudiced towards .
Argumentative	 in any comparison between two such organisations the distrusted organisation will have greater impact than the disliked organisation .
Argumentative	 this gives non-transparent think tanks an advantage over transparent and honest ones .
Argumentative	 billionaires are then able to buy influence by secretly funding organisations such as the global warming policy foundation or the institute of economic affairs that is then listened to , by the media and therefore the public , when their own views would simply be dismissed due to the personal motivations of the backers .
Argumentative	 by forcing all think tanks to reveal their funding , we level the playing field .
Argumentative	 even think tanks benefit from the introduction of this policy .
Argumentative	 the status quo leaves disclosure as a strategic device : think tanks are unwilling to disclose more than their competition for fear of being unfavourably portrayed .
Argumentative	 such negative competition , i.e. competition in factors that do not improve the products of the market , makes them unable to make rational decisions about their funding if , for instance , potential funders want to contribute only on the condition that this funding be made public .
Argumentative	 as a consequence , the advent of organisations who call for transparency has been praised by prominent think tanks like the new economics foundation .
Argumentative	 by depriving everybody of the strategic tool of revealing none or only a part of their funding , think tanks can not be pressured into hiding or providing certain information about their funders , and they can thus act more independently .
Argumentative	 in the status quo , the ability of think tanks to be non-transparent potentially provides a framework for criminal groups , or in extreme cases organisations , to handle large amounts of money without revealing where their money comes from or goes .
Argumentative	 we are allowing extremist groups to be exempt from answering to the government or shareholders in their management of money or information .
Argumentative	 in the us and canada , think tanks are also exempt from tax .
Argumentative	 by this mechanism , false think tanks can be used , for example , to channel money from openly extremist groups that could otherwise not access those parts of the world .
