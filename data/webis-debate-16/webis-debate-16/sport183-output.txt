Non-Argumentative	even following the collapse of white minority rule, south africa is still a country with many racial divides in society.
Non-Argumentative	 sport is no exception.
Non-Argumentative	rugby union was, and still is, a sport associated with white groups, particularly afrikaans speakers, in south africa.
Non-Argumentative	 before fully democratic rule in 1994, the national team, the springboks, were considered poster boys for apartheid.
Non-Argumentative	 they were met with opposition after thegleneagles agreement between commonwealth nations, which signalled the strong support for a sporting boycott of south africa.
Non-Argumentative	 south africa did not compete in a rugby world cup until thetournament, held in south africa shortly after the end of apartheid.
Non-Argumentative	 the home team famously won, but the abiding image of the final was nelson mandela, political prisoner turned president, presenting the william webb ellis trophy to captain francois pienaar.
Non-Argumentative	despite the increase in non-white participation (the national team only contained one non-white player in 1995, chester arthur, but there were nine non-white players in the national first team for two major matches in 2013), even after the end of apartheid, rugby union is a sport largely comprised of the white minority, in particular afrikaans speakers.
Non-Argumentative	 while south africa is one of the most competitive nations in international rugby, the sport is not the most popular in the country (that is football).
Non-Argumentative	 rugby union has been seen as, to some extent, a sport for social “elites” in many, but not all of the countries it has been played.
Non-Argumentative	effective for theseason, the south african rugby union has created a system of racial quotas in the third tier vodacom cup competition (below the super rugby competition run with australia and new zealand, and the currie cup, the flagship domestic competition).
Non-Argumentative	 each side, which represents all or part of a south african province (except for a kenyan team), will have to have a minimum number of black players: seven in each match-dayplayer squad, two of which forwards, five of which in the starting fifteen.
Non-Argumentative	 no penalties for violation of these quotas have been outlined by saru.
Non-Argumentative	no such quota system is used for the national team, or the currie cup and super rugby.
Non-Argumentative	 a quota system was introduced in 1999, but dropped in 2004.
Non-Argumentative	 in south africa, cricket (another sport historically far more popular in white communities) has used quotas too, with the domestic professional franchises required to field one black player with cash bonuses available for those who play more than one.
Non-Argumentative	afriforum, an organization linked to the largely white afrikaans speaking trade union solidariteit, has criticized the measure and has suggested it might be against the rules of the world governing body, the international rugby board, whose by-lawprohibits racial discrimination.
Argumentative	 it is plain for all to see how unrepresentative rugby union in south africa is .
Argumentative	 while there is not necessarily a deliberate policy of racism , it is very easy for biases to creep in .
Argumentative	 across the division where the quotas will come in only about% of players are black , a number that should increase to% .
Argumentative	 quotas could help concentrate the mind to ensure that the best team is picked .
Argumentative	 at grass roots level , there have been some cases of flat-out racial abuse of non-white players , including using racial terms that are particularly offensive in a south african context .
Argumentative	 the talent pool in south african rugby is not as racially diverse as one would expect from the `` rainbow nation '' -- some commentators have argued that england and france produce more top level black players than south africa .
Argumentative	 this is because top level players are a result of development from the grassroots up .
Argumentative	 targets or quotas could not only improve the talent pool of today , but could broaden it for the future .
Argumentative	 a new generation of youth across all races in south africa would be able to see that rugby union is a sport that accepts people from their backgrounds , making them more likely to participate in rugby union , either as players , coaches , referees or as a general part of the rugby fraternity .
Argumentative	 in, the south african social attitudes survey revealed that most south africans ,% , support a quota system .
Argumentative	 this support remained roughly the same over a four year period .
Argumentative	 sport should reflect the will of the population of the country , if the population wants quotas then there should be quotas .
Argumentative	 there is particularly strong support from quotas among black people ,% , implying they feel that something needs to be done in order to let them into the sport .
Argumentative	 doing nothing will simply ensure the status quo with very few non-white rugby players remains indefinitely .
