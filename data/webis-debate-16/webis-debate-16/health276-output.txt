Non-Argumentative	tobacco is one of the most widely-used recreational drugs in the world; mainly in the form of cigarettes, but also in cigars and pipes, and in combination with cannabis and marijuana in 'joints'.
Non-Argumentative	 although most countries put age restrictions on its use, over a billion adults smoke tobacco legally every day, and supplying this demand is big business.
Non-Argumentative	 as well as having serious health consequences for smokers themselves, the pollution of other people's atmospheres with cigarette smoke also makes this an environmental issue.
Non-Argumentative	 attitudes have changed rapidly over the past twenty years.
Non-Argumentative	in the developed world, public opinion has shifted against smoking.
Non-Argumentative	 by the 1990s, the sheer weight of evidence had forced major tobacco companies to admit that their products are both harmful and addictive.
Non-Argumentative	 many governments have substantially increased taxes on tobacco in order to discourage smoking, and often to alleviate the economic costs of smoking-related illness.
Non-Argumentative	 however, while smoking has declined amongst some groups, it has increased amongst others - particularly young women.
Non-Argumentative	 meanwhile restrictions on the industry in the developed world have seen a new emphasis on developing nations, and new markets.
Non-Argumentative	 governments have decided on imposing many strategies to reduce the number of smokers.
Non-Argumentative	key questions for this debate are: is it the proper role of government to legislate to protect citizens from the harmful effects of their own lifestyle decisions?
Non-Argumentative	 does tobacco advertising increase tobacco consumption?
Non-Argumentative	 do health warnings, however much of the cigarette packet they cover, reduce consumption?
Non-Argumentative	 what would be the effects of banning smoking in all public places, or even completely?
Non-Argumentative	this focuses on the question, what is the best strategy regarding consumption of tobacco.
Non-Argumentative	 does the state need a mechanism to prevent tobacco consumption at all?
Argumentative	 is the number of affected people and budget expanses better controlled by a ban or by other measures?
Argumentative	this argument is built on the premise that a ban or higher taxation in practice will lead to less smokers , especially protecting the families of smokers and other non-smoking citizens from potential health risks and premature death .
Argumentative	 smoking also has wider effects , not simply restricted to smokers themselves .
Argumentative	 so-called ` passive smoking ' is becoming an important issue : in a smoke-filled environment , non-smokers are also exposed to the risks associated with tobacco .
Argumentative	 especially when it comes to homes and families there is a high likelihood of `` passive smoking '' .
Argumentative	 research suggests that partners of smokers have an increased chance of developing lung cancer , even if they do not use tobacco products .
Argumentative	 recent research even shows , that according to the journal archives of pediatrics , children living in households of smokers are more prone to mental illness , depression and attention deficit disorder , adhd ,.
Argumentative	 so because restrictions on smoking prevent harm risks to families of smokers and third parties we should highly regulate or ban them .
Argumentative	 a ban or high restrictions is a good measure to diminish the effects of smoking in society , because unlike the spreading of information , which is usually done by schools / clubs , governmental restrictions or a total ban will ensure the access of measures to the whole population .
Argumentative	 through a ban on advertisement or higher taxation those citizens not involved in active educational structures get educated about the problem .
Argumentative	 studies on the ban of advertisements show that bans actually contribute great amounts to the reduction of smokers .
Argumentative	 `` the tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug , '' said dr douglas bettcher , director of who 's tobacco free initiative .
Argumentative	 `` but comprehensive advertising bans do work , reducing tobacco consumption by up to% in countries that have already taken this legislative step .
Argumentative	 ``so because these measures can drastically decrease smoking when other measures have failed , the state is right to impose bans on advertisement , higher prices or any other measures .
Argumentative	 there is little doubt that smoking tobacco is extremely harmful to the smoker 's health .
Argumentative	 in the us , for example , research by the american cancer society suggests that tobacco causes up to 400,000 deaths each year1 - more than aids , alcohol , drug abuse , car crashes , murders , suicides , and fires combined .
Argumentative	 world-wide somemillion people die from smoking each year2 - one every ten seconds - which estimates suggest will rise tomillion by.
Argumentative	 smokers are up totimes more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers , and smoking can lead to a host of other health problems , including emphysema and heart disease .
Argumentative	 in a democracy the people elect leaders and trust them with a term , where their duty is solely to look after the wellbeing of the country and its citizens .
Argumentative	 the politicians , having the resources and time , are well equipped to make a better and more informed decision on activities dangerous to the individual , others and the society .
Argumentative	 therefore one of the principles is , that elected representatives have to make sure their citizens get the best possible protection in society .
Argumentative	 even if this infringes on some of their rights .
Argumentative	 that is why taking hard drugs and breaking the speed limit are also illegal .
Argumentative	 it would therefore be reasonable to ban smoking or limit with different means the usage of tobacco - an activity which kills millions of people each year .
Argumentative	 precedent is that if a company produces food that is poisonous or a car that fails safety tests , the product is immediately taken off the market .
Argumentative	 since all cigarettes and other tobacco products are poisonous and potentially lethal , they should all be taken off the market .
Argumentative	 in short , smoking should be banned or very harshly regulated .
