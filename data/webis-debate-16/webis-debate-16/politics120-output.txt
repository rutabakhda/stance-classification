Non-Argumentative	in recent years, there has been much discussion regarding the concept of a european defence force (sometimes referred to as the “euro corps” or edf).
Non-Argumentative	 such a standing armed force would be drawn from eu member-nations and operate under eu control, in contrast to the existing nato grouping which has the united states as a prominent and influential member.
Non-Argumentative	 as is often the case with matters of national and regional defence, there is much controversy as to whether the european defence force is a good idea.
Argumentative	 debates on the euro corps can often revolve around the proposed role of nato in the post-cold war era, and it is important to realise that the significance of the edf may resonate beyond the borders of the european union.
Argumentative	it is important for the eu to have a defence policy independent of nato .
Argumentative	 with its origins in the cold war , and its preponderance of american influence , nato carries a great deal of historical and geopolitical baggage .
Argumentative	 this means that nato can not easily intervene in eastern europe without incurring the displeasure of russia .
Argumentative	 this was best proven during theconflict between russia and georgia , when georgia 's impending accession to nato was seen as part of the incentive for russian support to the ` break-away ' regions in georgia .
Argumentative	 the european defence force will allow the eu to deal with crises in eastern and central europe more effectively , as they will not have to tiptoe around russia as much .
Argumentative	 the european union has significant integration and convergence of the political and economic spheres .
Argumentative	 integration of defence policy and the establishment of a european defence force should be the logical next step .
Argumentative	 the african union took this step and has achieved success in combat missions defending the union .
Argumentative	 nato has been crucial to maintaining the balance of power during the cold war .
Argumentative	 although there have been some arguments amongst its member states , nato has shown us that a standing multinational defence force is possible and more importantly works well overall .
Argumentative	 the recent nato deployment in libya is an example of its regional influence and military flexibility .
Argumentative	 considering many members of nato are also members of the eu , the proposed european defence force could follow its example and complement it .
Argumentative	 with the growing industrial and economic maturity of the european union and its members , it is now financially feasible for the eu to have its own standing defence force .
Argumentative	 the proposed edf would also create a great many jobs as european defence contractors could be recruited into supplying equipment and weaponry .
Argumentative	 constant political instability and war in and near the middle east call for a united single force charged with the defence of eu countries lying close to the volatile areas , turkey is a prime candidate for eu membership , and with its location on the border of both syria and iraq , will require support if its refugee problem is to remain manageable .
Argumentative	 the revolutions in northern africa also call for a stabilising force in the region , particularly in italy where a ` refugee crisis ' has coincided with the attempts of anti-gaddafi libyans to flee the country .
Argumentative	 if the eu is to take its growing role upon the world stage seriously , it needs a dedicated defence force to make an impact in the region .
