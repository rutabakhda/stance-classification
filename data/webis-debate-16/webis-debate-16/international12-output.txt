Non-Argumentative	crimea will on the 16th have a referendum on whether the region should join russia.
Non-Argumentative	 it is almost certain that the people will ratify the decision of the crimean parliament that they want to be a region of russia not ukraine.
Non-Argumentative	 ukraine has maintained that such a referendum is illegal so the crimea’s vote is likely to inflame rather than dampen the tensions between russia and ukraine that have been near the point of war since russian soldiers occupied crimea as part of a crimean self-defence force.
Non-Argumentative	it is also clear that the broader international tensions will also remain.
Non-Argumentative	 the g7 (canada, france, germany, italy, japan, uk, and us) has said “any such referendum would have no legal effect… it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force… we would not recognize the outcome.”
Non-Argumentative	so is there any possible solution to the crisis.
Non-Argumentative	 it is clear that russia and the united states (acting as proxy for the ukrainian government) are a long way apart on the issue.
Non-Argumentative	  the united states wants russia to pull back its military from crimea, and also its influence including halting the referendum vote.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover it wants negotiations with the current ukrainian government which russia refuses to recognise.
Non-Argumentative	 russia rejects such terms with the foreign minister lavrov stating “to be frank it raises many questions on our side … everything was stated in terms of allegedly having a conflict between russia and ukraine, and in terms of accepting the fait accompli”.
Non-Argumentative	 russia says it has counter proposals that will comply with international law but has not given any clue as to what they might be.
Non-Argumentative	 assuming the crimea is as far as russia intends to go into ukraine then the maximalist positions by the two sides might be said to be for the russians; keep crimea, ukraine’s government replaced preferably with a pro-russian government.
Non-Argumentative	 while ukraine’s position would be complete russian withdrawal, and elections are held at the end of the year as planned.
Non-Argumentative	so what would be the meeting point between such positions?
Non-Argumentative	 russia would likely be willing to take one or the other, neither of which the west or ukraine are likely to consider a sufficient climbdown.
Non-Argumentative	the question then is how to negotiate a situation where russia gets what it wants but ukraine maintains its territorial integrity.
Non-Argumentative	 the lord owen, a former british foreign secretary, suggests leasing crimea to russia.
Non-Argumentative	 russia would negotiate a lease over not just sevastopol as they have now but over the whole of crimea.
Non-Argumentative	 a lease would mean that the territory remains ukrainian soil but russia has complete or almost complete control over the administration of the region.
Non-Argumentative	 it being a lease means that ukraine would not simply be giving up the right to administer the peninsular but would be paid for it either through cash payments or through cheap oil and gas supplies from russia.
Argumentative	 agreeing a lease would provide a much needed peaceful solution to the crimean crisis which would not only solve the immediate crisis but would also prevent future flare ups .
Argumentative	 shortly after russian forces moved into crimea prime minister arseny yatseniuk of ukraine said `` this is not a threat : this is actually the declaration of war to my country '' .
Argumentative	 it has not so far been a shooting war , and no one wants it to escalate .
Argumentative	 russia 's un ambassador has said `` russia does not want war ... we do n't want any further exacerbation of the situation . ''
Argumentative	 but when there are constant tensions the best way to prevent a potentially unpredictable situation is to provide a solution to the situation .
Argumentative	 a lease should be considered .
Argumentative	 there have been many suggested motives for russia 's sending military forces into crimea .
Argumentative	 providing a lease on crimea to russia would provide a solution to most of russia 's main objectives ; the russians in crimea are protected , and the russian hold on its black sea base is secure .
Argumentative	 more importantly the crisis started after the defeat of president yanukovych and the resulting blow to russian prestige in what russia sees as a zero sum game , if one side wins the other automatically loses to the same extent .
Argumentative	 an invasion or crimea regained russian leverage but left russia with little room to manoeuvre as any climb-down would leave putin with nothing .
Argumentative	 a lease gets out of this zero sum problem as both can gain .
Argumentative	 a lease would enable russia to make an agreement with the ukrainian government and recognise that government without having to lose face as any other solution which maintains ukrainian territorial integrity would .
Argumentative	 ukraine is in a dire financial situation ; it has gone to the imf seeking $ 15billion to help stabilise the economy with a bailout .
Argumentative	 the interim finance minister yuri kolobov suggests that even this amount will not be enough for the full year with ukraine needing $ 34.4 billion .
Argumentative	 finance was one of the reasons why ukraine turned to russia in november; russia was offering money when the eu was not .
Argumentative	 the lease agreed for the black sea fleet involves the payment of $ 90million per year and the renegotiations ininvolved giving ukraine cut price gas as well .
Argumentative	 a lease for the whole of the peninsular with almostmillion inhabitants and is close to the size of belgium would cost a lot more , potentially enough to fill much of that financial hole .
Argumentative	 while of the core points of sovereignty is that is indivisible this has not stopped the existence of other similar deals happening in the past .
Argumentative	 locally the black sea fleet is a good example there have however been more famous examples in the past ; the panama canal zone was leased to the united states fromtofor $ 250,000 per year , later increased .
Argumentative	 there are other instances of territory being leased ; the clearest example being hong kong 's new territories which were leased rent free foryears fromafter china was defeated by japan -- at the time there was a general view that if one great power gained then all the others have to as well .
Argumentative	 that leasing territory is an established practice means that it should be easy to apply to this case .
