Non-Argumentative	the internet has become a major centre of extremist activity, one so important that osama bin ladin back insaid that 90% of all jihadist activity will soon be through the media, which in turn is increasingly being dominated, at least from a jihadi point of view by the internet.
Non-Argumentative	 often spread out geographically, communication online has become the primary tool for their discussion and organization.
Non-Argumentative	 not only cat-lovers but also radical islamist movements have capitalised on the potential of the internet.
Non-Argumentative	 using websites to spread their message, they have increased their reach in the 21st century, spreading its radical messages and gaining recruits in the west.
Non-Argumentative	this growth has sparked serious debate about the role of internet intermediaries (isps like aol or bt but also osps like facebook, google and twitter) in the combatting of extremist, dangerous groups using the web as a platform.
Non-Argumentative	 some groups suggest that it is should fall to the individual intermediaries to self-police and to block sites that promote various brands of extremism.
Non-Argumentative	 others question whether this action will adulterate free access to the internet more generally, or if this duty should fall to private agents and not the state.
Non-Argumentative	it is necessary to make something clear in this debate that the arguments stand in most legal contexts.
Non-Argumentative	 with some tweaks one might use these arguments to discuss a mandate from the state to require that isps block these sites, or to discuss the arguments in the context of a regime in which isps have freedom to allow or disallow these sites.
Non-Argumentative	 the various arguments have different weight and different emphasis given the paradigm considered.
Non-Argumentative	 the arguments presented in this debate seek to be open enough to be utilized in varying contexts.
Non-Argumentative	for the purpose of this debate, “extremist” can be taken broadly to mean any group that promotes popular revolution or violent action against the state, individual human beings or groups within society.
Non-Argumentative	 this definition is quite broad, and the arguments put forward in the following debate can be used quite effectively even if the definition is broadened or narrowed to a degree.
Argumentative	 freedom of speech certainly may be curtailed when real harms can be shown to arise from it .
Argumentative	 extremist sites serve as centers of dangerous dissent , whose members threaten all of society .
Argumentative	 they promote a message that is fundamentally bad speech , because it can not it can not be argued with and promotes aims that are so anathema to free society that its dissemination represents a true threat to people 's safety .
Argumentative	 the threat extremists represent to free society demands that their right to speech online be curtailed .
Argumentative	 by blocking these sites , isps certainly are denying some freedom of speech , but it is a necessarily harmful form of speech that has no value in the global commons .
Argumentative	 thus , there is essentially no real loss of valuable speech in censoring extremist websites .
Argumentative	 isps are ultimately private providers of a service .
Argumentative	 because of this they should retain the right to restrict that service to certain groups .
Argumentative	 so long as isps make public their policy for what constitutes extremism so that consumers can decide if they want to opt into it , there is no real issue .
Argumentative	 there are many filters available to users to screen out certain materials already , for example internet providers offer customers the option to block adult content , and this is merely an extension of this approach .
Argumentative	 businesses must be able to sort their own ethos .
Argumentative	 some isps may not opt to use this power given to them by the state , but others may not wish to carry content they consider dangerous .
Argumentative	 because extremism is on the very fringe of speech and opinion , and because of the potential dangers that can arise from it , it is only right that the state give some ability to isps to block objectionable content .
Argumentative	 the isps are the gatekeepers of information .
Argumentative	 when the internet places no moral judgments on content and the isps let all information through without commentary , it lends an air of permissiveness to the beliefs put forward , that they are held by reasonable people .
Argumentative	 the internet is a great tool for education , but also one that can be used to sow misinformation and extreme rhetoric .
Argumentative	 extremist groups have been able to use the internet to a remarkable extent in promoting their beliefs and recruiting new members .
Argumentative	 worse still , the administrators of these extremist sites are able to choke of things like dissenting commenters , giving the illusion that their view is difficult , or even impossible to reasonably challenge .
Argumentative	 in doing so they create an echo chamber for their ideas that allows them to spread and to affect people , particularly young people susceptible to such manipulation .
Argumentative	 the best example of this activity is in the international jihadist community and its reaching out to people in the west .
Argumentative	 young disaffected muslims have received an introduction to militant islamism from sites often based abroad , but also some domestically , increasing the number of believers in an extreme , militant form of that religion .
Argumentative	 by denying these people a platform on the internet , isps are able to not only make a moral stance that is unequivocal , but also to choke off access to new members who can be saved by never seeing the negative messages .
Argumentative	 the greatest fear people have about extremist groups is not their rhetoric , but the actions the rhetoric precipitates .
Argumentative	 extremists have proven adept at setting up basic websites through which to build communities to organize and coordinate extreme actions .
Argumentative	 this means in the most limited form the coordinating of extremist demonstrations and rallies , but also violent and terrorist actions .
Argumentative	 the best example of this is as-sahab , al-qaeda 's media arm , which has used an extensive web presence to galvanize supporters and to coordinate terrorist attacks .
Argumentative	 in using the tools of the mass media extremists have succeeded in bringing supporters to their cause , people who are often geographically diffuse , into a close community capable of action and disruption that harms all citizens .
Argumentative	 if blocking these websites entirely isps would pose a significant barrier to these extremist groups organising .
Argumentative	 even more damaging to these networks in the long terms would be the drop in recruitment due to a reduction in their reach .
Argumentative	 isps can significantly hamper these organizations from ever embarking on serious violent actions , and from coalescing in the first place by denying them their most effective springboard .
Argumentative	 the most important effect is in the prevention of radicalization in the first place .
Argumentative	 preventing , or at least hampering access to extremist materials serves to keep impressionable , swayable people from experiences that might turn them to extremism .
Argumentative	 as the access providers for the internet isps are best placed to implement policies for blocking extremist sites and so are the natural option for deciding when and which sites to block .
Argumentative	 furthermore , because the state is often slow due its extensive bureaucracy , it is less able to respond with alacrity to extremist sites popping up online .
Argumentative	 isps on the other hand are likely to be able to act as soon as they are informed of the existence of a website whereas working through government would simply add an extra layer of requests and orders .
Argumentative	 the isps blocking the site also creates a fire break between the state and the action so not giving the extremists the ammunition that state intervention might give them .
Argumentative	 essentially , the good result of eliminating these sites from public access is accomplished faster , more effectively , and with lesser backlash than if any other agent did the blocking .
