Non-Argumentative	from its genesis, african nations have been involved in the icc structure – the first ratifying nation was senegal, and the icc has much african involvement, including five african judges and the current prosecutor, fatou bensouda.
Non-Argumentative	however, all the indictments at the icc have been for africans in cases involving african nations – almost all of which on states that voluntarily referred the cases to the court.
Non-Argumentative	 three african situations were not referred by a country – the sudan and libya cases were referred by the un security council, and the situation following the post-election violence in kenya in 2008-09 by the prosecutor.
Non-Argumentative	 the kenyan trials are ongoing, the libyan inductees are being tried in libya, and the sudanese inductees are, in the main, on the run.
Non-Argumentative	the kenya case was raised when the office of the prosecutor (otp) used its power in the rome statute, which kenya signed and ratified, to launch a case.
Non-Argumentative	 this followed the unwillingness of kenyan domestic authorities to prosecute those individuals deemed most responsible for orchestrating the violence after the disputedpresidential election, in which 1,000 people were killed.
Non-Argumentative	uhuru kenyatta and william ruto, two prominent kenyan politicians, were indicted, appeared voluntarily, and had their charges confirmed in 2012.
Non-Argumentative	 kenyatta is accused of using a banned gang to keep power for one party at all costs, while ruto is accused of ethnically cleansing ethnic groups seen as supportive of another candidate from certain areas.
Non-Argumentative	 however, following their election as president and deputy president of kenya respectively earlier in 2013, the african union moved towards taking a position hostile to the icc.
Non-Argumentative	 the ruto and kenyatta trials are the unique - the first leaders selected by generally free and fair elections to be tried by the icc.
Non-Argumentative	this case has brought to a head the question of the membership of african states in the icc.
Non-Argumentative	 kenya’s parliament has voted in favour of withdrawing from the icc.
Non-Argumentative	 kenya however has not yet actually decided to declare its intention to withdraw to the un which would be necessary to withdraw.
Non-Argumentative	 once a state has stated its intention to withdraw it takes a year to take effect.
Non-Argumentative	 if kenya were to leave it would be the first state party to do so.
Argumentative	 every person indicted by the icc so far has been an african , for events which occurred in africa , all bar one case , the libya situation , in which no trials have started and seem a long way off , are in sub-saharan africa .
Argumentative	 the icc has not brought actions against anyone involved in conflict in colombia , or for the conflict in sri lanka or for human rights abuses around the world .
Argumentative	 the icc is simply selectively prosecuting .
Argumentative	 instead of the icc structure , the african union has proposed an african criminal court .
Argumentative	 an acc could not only bring justice home to africa , by creating a court which will not appear to african nations as being imposed by outsiders , but also be able to have additional remits to address other issues in africa that the icc does not have powers to deal with , such as coups , corruption and drug trafficking .
Argumentative	 an african criminal court may also have a chance of being seen as more legitimate than the icc , which had only% support in kenya in july.
Argumentative	 the icc creates a way that foreigners , and in particular the west with its tendency towards intervention , can remove and imprison african leaders .
Argumentative	 uhuru kenyatta , the president of kenya , who has been indicted by the court , has referred to it as a `` toy of declining imperialist powers '' .
Argumentative	 the court is largely funded by western countries , with the european union providing over half the cost .
Argumentative	 so it should not be surprising if the west has a lot of power over the court .
Argumentative	 moreover the west is dominant in the united nations security council so potentially controls both the methods of referring a country to the icc without its permission .
Argumentative	 the icc has not been particularly effective in dealing with the situation in uganda , the icc prosecutions having been a distraction to local community reconciliation and leading to further violence .
Argumentative	 similarly , the situation in darfur has not been helped by icc involvement , with mass destruction of villages by people already indicted by the international criminal court .
Argumentative	 due to his indictment , a diplomatic solution has become harder as rome statute signatories are under a legal duty to arrest sudanese leader omar al-bashir , although many have just ignored this .
