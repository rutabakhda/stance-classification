Non-Argumentative	hate speech is a controversial issue in all western liberal democracies (wlds).
Non-Argumentative	 what makes hate speech on university campuses a unique topic is the combination of public space, the historical role of universities as centres of free speech and expression, and the age and impressionability of students.
Non-Argumentative	the definition of what constitutes hate speech is also controversial.
Non-Argumentative	 for the purposes of the debate, proposition should set out a clear definition of hate speech as being the wilful promotion of hatred towards a group based on non-immutable personal characteristics.
Non-Argumentative	 an immutable person characteristic includes a person’s race, gender, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation.
Non-Argumentative	as far as a model goes, there are currently at leastamerican universities with campus speech codes (fire, “spotlight on speech codes”).
Non-Argumentative	 these codes are written by the school and so vary greatly from campus to campus.
Argumentative	 however, for this round it should be sufficient to argue that schools should have (or should be mandated to have) speech codes with meaningful enforcement mechanisms like expulsion and/or bans from entering the campus.
Argumentative	hate speech poses a clear danger to students and other members of the campus community .
Argumentative	 often , the hatred is directed towards minority groups that are easily identifiable based on skin colour , clothing , or behaviour .
Argumentative	 because these minorities are easy to identify , they can be targeted by those swayed by the speaker 's message .
Argumentative	 every hate crime is a tragedy and an attack against the principles of wlds .
Argumentative	 even when the message does n't provoke violence , it can have a deep emotional harm on members of the targeted community .
Argumentative	 as such , the government has a duty to intervene to ensure that individuals are safe .
Argumentative	 while hate speech is a form of expression , it is not one that encourages dialogue .
Argumentative	 by promoting hatred based on immutable personal characteristics it is by definition anti-dialogue .
Argumentative	 hate speech does not contribute anything ; it merely provides a justification for violence and discrimination .
Argumentative	 extreme messages , be they in words or through symbols , deter moderates from voicing their opinions , either because they do not want to legitimize the message or out of fear of reprisals .
Argumentative	 this reduces the net dialogue on university campuses and injures the quality of the dialogue that remains .
Argumentative	 members of groups that find themselves the targets of hate speech will be less likely to attend universities where they feel targeted .
Argumentative	 as a result , those campuses will become less diverse which will decrease the most effective deterrent of hateful ideas : understanding through interaction .
Argumentative	 less muslim , gay , jewish , etc. students on campus is exactly what those promoting hatred are trying to achieve .
Argumentative	 less students of the targeted group makes them easier to target because there are less people speaking out against the hate speech .
Argumentative	 a downward spiral is created that , if not checked , can drastically reduce campus diversity which is a massive harm to social integration and social harmony .
Argumentative	 speech codes or other censorship sends a signal to minorities that they are welcome in the university .
Argumentative	 when individuals feel that they will be targeted at a university based on who they are , they are less likely to attend that university either out of fear they will be discriminated against or because they believe that they will not be allowed to express themselves freely without being discriminated against or assaulted .
Argumentative	 no group should be discouraged from attaining higher education because of immutable personal characteristics .
Argumentative	 tertiary education is at the heart of social mobility and self-actualization .
Argumentative	 even if no attack ever takes place , because hate speech can create an atmosphere which deters members of society from attending university the state is justified in banning it .
