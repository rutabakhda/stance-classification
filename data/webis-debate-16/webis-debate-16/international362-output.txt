Non-Argumentative	the united nations security council (unsc) is one of the main institutions of the united nations.
Non-Argumentative	 it was created after wwii to maintain international peace and security.
Non-Argumentative	 based on its founding charter (the united nations charter), it has the power to establish peacekeeping missions, impose international sanctions, and can authorise military action against a sovereign state.
Non-Argumentative	the unsc has fifteen members.
Non-Argumentative	 there are five permanent (p5) members (china, france, russia, the uk and the usa) wielding veto power, and ten elected non-permanent members with two-year terms, half of whom are replaced each year.
Non-Argumentative	 these elected members are chosen by the united nations regional groups.
Non-Argumentative	 the ‘african group’ chooses three members; the ‘latin america and the caribbean group’, the ‘asian group’, and the ‘western european and others’ group choose two members each.
Non-Argumentative	 the eastern european group chooses one member.
Non-Argumentative	 finally, the tenth of these members will be an arab country, alternately from the asian or african group.
Non-Argumentative	the european union (eu) is an economic and political union, currently consisting ofmember states, including two permanent members of the unsc: france and the uk.
Non-Argumentative	 originally, the eu was created mainly for closer economic cooperation, but political goals have been added along the way.
Non-Argumentative	 one of these political goals is to create a common security and foreign policy.
Non-Argumentative	 until the end of(when the treaty of lisbon came to effect), one of the three official ‘pillars’ of eu policy was the common security and foreign policy (csfp).
Non-Argumentative	 the lisbon treaty merged the common foreign and security policy with the work of the european commissioner for external relations and european neighbourhood policy, creating a ‘high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy’.
Non-Argumentative	 the high representative is in charge of the new european external action service (eeas), a diplomatic service of sorts for the eu.
Non-Argumentative	 it remains the case that the high representative can only speak for the eu in foreign policy areas where allmember states agree; foreign affairs remains an area where all member states retain a veto.
Non-Argumentative	the european union secured ‘super-observer’ status on the 3rd may 2011.
Non-Argumentative	 this grants “the delegation of the european union the right to make interventions, as well as the right of reply and the ability to present oral proposals and amendments” in the united nations general assembly.
Non-Argumentative	given the increased activity of the eu in foreign policy areas, the question has arisen whether the eu should get a permanent seat on the unsc, replacing france and the uk who would lose their permanent seats.
Non-Argumentative	 this case examines the arguments for and against that specific proposal.
Argumentative	 the united nations is a global body that must represent the whole world .
Argumentative	 just as democratic governments need to remain representative to be legitimate so the same is true of intergovernmental organisations .
Argumentative	 if the uk and france hang on to their permanent seats forever , the unsc will lose its legitimacy , as the united nations will no longer be seen to be representative .
Argumentative	 the result will be an increased risk of war and conflict because the world 's major powers have no legitimate shared arena for discussing their interests .
Argumentative	 this is exactly what happened to the league of nations after world war i .
Argumentative	 as many of the most powerful nations , usa , ussr and germany were unwilling to join or barred from joining the league never had much legitimacy .
Argumentative	 as a result the league was unable to prevent conflicts in manchuria and abyssinia , ethiopia , eventually leading to world war ii .
Argumentative	 since their interest in a stable world through the legitimacy of the unsc outweighs their interest in a formal veto-power , france and the uk should be willing to give up their veto power .
Argumentative	 the permanent seats for france and the uk are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of world war ii .
Argumentative	 however , the global balance of powers has shifted significantly since then : france and the uk have declined ; britain 's manufacturing exports dropped from% of world manufacturing exports into% in.
Argumentative	 and the uk was 6.52 % of the world economy inbut down to 3.56 in.
Argumentative	 moreover both had large empires which were lost in the decades after.
Argumentative	 at the same time the eu has emerged as a major player in the international arena .
Argumentative	 the eu is one of the world 's largest trade blocs , has the world 's largest gdp , and represents almost half a billion people .
Argumentative	 a permanent seat for the eu would reflect those new power dimensions .
Argumentative	 the eu might function as an economic union , but its original goal was to prevent war from ever happening again on the european continent .
Argumentative	 the political resolution of the congress of europe insaid `` it is the urgent duty of the nations of europe to create an economic and political union in order to assure security and social progress ... the creation of a united europe is an essential element in the creation of a united world . ''
Argumentative	 the economic integration is a means to this goal , by making member states economically too dependent on each other for them to want to declare war on each other .
Argumentative	 given this history , the eu can contribute a lot of knowledge and experience on how to use ` soft power ' in a foreign policy context .
Argumentative	 europe has been successful in creating peace on a previously warlike continent .
Argumentative	 it has also had successes in encouraging reform in the countries of eastern europe and is continuing to do so in the balkans through enlargement .
Argumentative	 croatia was at war with its neighbors fifteen years ago and part of yugoslavia twenty years ago but will become the 28th member of the eu in.
Argumentative	 being a member of the unsc would deepen europe 's commitment to international peace-keeping and peace-making missions , something which currently varies very widely between member states , and push them to spend sufficient on equipping their militaries for such missions .
Argumentative	 the unsc could turn the eu 's soft power outwards to help the world .
Argumentative	 as a result it should have a seat at the world 's foremost foreign policy institution .
Argumentative	 in the past the european union has not had the necessary foreign policy bureaucracy and decision making capabilities to be able to control a unsc seat .
Argumentative	 since the lisbon treaty this has changed .
Argumentative	 the treaty created a president of the european council , currently herman van rompuy .
Argumentative	 and a european external action service , eeas , which will eventually have a staff of 5,400 .
Argumentative	 the eeas is a functionally autonomous eu body with a large number of embassies around the world .
Argumentative	 this will give the eu representation in most countries ,with ambassadors out of a total of, and the ability to coordinate a foreign policy .
Argumentative	 a seat at the united nations security council would be a natural extension of this .
Argumentative	 the most practical way to reform the united nations is for france and britain to give way to a european union seat .
Argumentative	 although there would inevitably be some loss of influence for both nations the pain would be minimised by retaining one seat between them .
Argumentative	 the european union often decides what countries get what jobs based upon internal politics , so for example catherine ashton became high representative for foreign and security policy because tony blair did not get the presidency .
Argumentative	 it would therefore be possible through an internal agreement in the european union to make sure that france and the united kingdom retain control of the unsc seat through having control of the foreign minister post and the post of ambassador to the united nations .
