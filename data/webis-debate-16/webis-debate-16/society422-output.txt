Non-Argumentative	    despite enhanced access to education and political participation, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions worldwide.
Non-Argumentative	 the gender inequality in representation is often explained through historical, cultural, socioeconomic, and institutional factors affecting women’s status.
Non-Argumentative	 in 2013, the business world has only two female chief executives in the ftse 100.
Non-Argumentative	 the introduction of gender quotas is an effort to close the participatory gap between genders.
Non-Argumentative	 both those in favour and against quotas link their arguments to the effects on the economic factors.
Non-Argumentative	  the latest example takes place in the european union (eu) where the voluntary self-regulation aiming at gender equality in boardrooms did not change the status quo and women still account for only 13.5 per cent of board members in large public companies.
Non-Argumentative	 this failure resulted in a proposal from the eu commission that will require national governments to impose penalties, such as fines or a loss of government contracts, when more thanper cent of a firm’s non-executive directors are of the same gender in 2020.
Non-Argumentative	 state-owned companies will have to meet the requirement by 2018.
Non-Argumentative	 the written style of the proposal ensures that men are likewise not negatively affected by gender imbalance.
Non-Argumentative	 it would introduce reporting requirements for any company in which fewer than two out of five posts on the corporate board were held by women or men.
Non-Argumentative	 in those cases, the companies would have to prove candidates for board positions had been chosen purely on the basis of experience.
Non-Argumentative	 in situations where finalists had the same level of experience, the post would have to go to the candidate from the gender underrepresented on the board -- in most cases to a woman.
Non-Argumentative	    this requires some definitions.
Non-Argumentative	 this discussion interprets ‘gender quotas’ as a set minimum of reserved places for women in business institutions that could be constitutional and/or legislative or voluntary.
Non-Argumentative	 by ‘advantageous’, the proposition argues that gender quotas stimulate, support, or foster an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services, compared to the period prior to their introduction.
Argumentative	 gender equality at the workplace is an important principle that businesses should follow .
Argumentative	 if we consider men and women to be equal then they should be equally represented at the top levels of politics , society , and business .
Argumentative	 this is not simply a national issue , but a pan-eu problem of justice and equal rights .
Argumentative	 gender equality is linked to the fundamental human rights that the eu endorses and the lack of progress in terms of women in high positions of europe requires a proactive stance .
Argumentative	 as morin-chartier argues , the eu directives are about being a model for one another and the quotas will serve as an archetype for others worldwide .
Argumentative	 therefore , the quotas are necessary to encourage progress in this field as other tools have not brought equal gender representation .
Argumentative	 by introducing gender quotas to ensure gender equality , one could not only increase the labour force by bringing more women but also enhance the labour productivity and the available talent pool in a country .
Argumentative	 this would stimulate businesses to expand , innovate , and compete .
Argumentative	 this process has an effect of raising tax revenue and social security payments .
Argumentative	 the overall effect is the positive growth of the economy .
Argumentative	 therefore , addressing social injustice and higher economic returns are mutually supportive goals .
Argumentative	 this argument is particularly relevant for qualified women who could be hired at executive positions , but are prevented from doing so due to cultural beliefs , societal practices , and lack of economic and institutional support .
Argumentative	 a study by asa löfström on the links between economic growth and productivity in the labour market argues that if women 's productivity level rises to the level of men 's , europe 's gdp could grow% which makes women 's participation is of crucial importance to europe 's economy .
Argumentative	 quotas would allow for a better utilisation of the talent pool ; as currently ,% of the students graduating from europe 's higher educational institutes are women .
Argumentative	 with the current access to education and the introduction of quotas against barriers of existing prejudices , women will have incentives and support to increase their productivity in the case of norway , the quota law requires all public , state-owned , municipal , inter-municipal and cooperative companies to appoint at least% women on their boards per.
Argumentative	 the law led to a fast increase from% women on boards of public limited companies into 36 % in.
Argumentative	 quotas attempting to maximise the number of educated and skilled women in executive positions could improve corporate performance and help raise national productivity .
Argumentative	 but doing so will depend on keeping ambitious , well-qualified women moving up the management ranks .
Argumentative	 gender quotas will encourage more women to pursue education and career options leading to the top of executive positions .
Argumentative	 quotas create incentives for women to adapt their job preferences to the more accessible boardroom positions and develop necessary skills which would reduce the need for positive discrimination in the future .
Argumentative	 encouraged to develop relevant skills , women will contribute to the long-term talent pool and the economy .
Argumentative	 according to mckinsey report , women 's interest in being leaders increases as they progress from entry level to middle management which is exactly what the principle behind quotas aims to encourage - more women following professional career development .
Argumentative	 this is very important in the short run during which , according to research , women who have high position stimulate other women 's interest in traditionally male-dominated sectors and encourage them to pursue similar career paths .
Argumentative	 there are many reports showing that there is a positive correlation between the number of women on high positions and the companies ' performance .
Argumentative	 a report from the mckinsey organizational health index , ohi , argues that companies with three or more women in top positions , executive committee and higher , scored higher than their peers .
Argumentative	 companies that score highly on all the ohi measures have also shown superior financial performance .
Argumentative	 this is often related to the high overall education level of women on boards .
Argumentative	 in norway , there has been some advancement in firms ' human capital as a result of the quotas , which may result in increased profits in the future due to the increasing number of well educated women .
Argumentative	 female managers tend to promote a communal and collaborative style of leadership that can improve a company 's performance and work culture .
Argumentative	 organizations with women in top leadership positions are also more likely to provide work-life assistance to all employees .
Argumentative	 norwegian scholars have found that the increased number of women on boards has led to more focused and strategic decision-making , increased communication , and decreased conflict .
Argumentative	 in fact , many successful business women , such as sheryl sandberg , also argue that more women in business could change business ethics and the male-associated image of successful business model that will bring competitive advantages to companies and thus , to the eu economies .
