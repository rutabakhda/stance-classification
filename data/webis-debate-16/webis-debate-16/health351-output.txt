Non-Argumentative	according to the who, inthere were approximately 2.25 million premature deaths worldwide linked to alcohol.
Non-Argumentative	 alcohol is responsible for 4.5% of the global disease burden, even after the protective effects of low and moderate alcohol consumption had been considered.
Non-Argumentative	 furthermore, binge drinking (excessive alcohol consumption) is becoming an increasing problem in most countries.
Non-Argumentative	in almost all countries in the world, adults are allowed to buy and consume alcohol with very little restriction (although there are often laws about the exact hours that bars and shops are allowed to sell alcohol and laws against drinking and driving).
Non-Argumentative	 this is in marked contrast to the legal situation with regard to other mind-altering (or ‘psycho-active’) drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, acid, and heroin.
Non-Argumentative	 the first question this offers is whether alcohol and other drugs should be treated the same?
Non-Argumentative	 how do you make a difference?
Non-Argumentative	 further on the question is also, what is an effective policy regarding alcohol consumption.
Non-Argumentative	 is it higher prices or the ultimate “ban” approach?
Non-Argumentative	currently a few islamic countries have the ban imposed, these are saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, the united arab emirates, iran and the gaza.
Non-Argumentative	 inalso the “liberal arabic country” bahrain has started a debate about banning alcohol.
Non-Argumentative	in the past, the experience of ‘prohibition’ in the usa in the 1920s and 1930s, when there was a huge black market in alcohol run by a powerful criminal underworld, makes most people very wary of trying to ban alcohol and equalize it with other drugs.
Non-Argumentative	some countries use a total ban on all types of alcohol; this also includes beer, wine as well as stronger liquor.
Non-Argumentative	 other countries (due to tourism and investment) have a special license for foreigners as the state connects the ban mainly to their islamic heritage.
Non-Argumentative	is it time to try to solve the alcohol problem through more restrictions and campaigns or is it time for a ban policy?
Argumentative	  alcohol is a mind altering drug , which can cause individuals to take actions they would have not done otherwise .
Argumentative	 this does not refer to loosened inhibitions , but also extends to harmful acts against themselves and others .
Argumentative	 democracy is based on the principle that the majority of people are to elect leaders and trust them with a term , where their duty is solely to look after the wellbeing of the country and its citizens .
Argumentative	 the politicians , having the resources and time which they have to use , to get well equipped to make more informed decision on activities dangerous to the individual , others and the society .
Argumentative	 one of the principles in society therefore is that elected representatives have to make sure their citizens get the best possible protection in society .
Argumentative	 even if this infringes on some of their rights .
Argumentative	 alcohol for a long time has been kept because the government trusted the people ; they would make responsible decisions regarding alcohol .
Argumentative	 however , each year , the society loses , on ayear based average , more than 75,000 individuals to alcohol related diseases or accidents .
Argumentative	 thus the citizens proved not to be responsible ; even though they had information available they did not make the choice that would keep them alive .
Argumentative	 the government has a duty to protect those irresponsible citizens , because otherwise they will not be able to contribute to society to the extent they could without alcohol .
Argumentative	 and because the government does not know who is the one that will make a stupid decision that will engender their lives in the long run , for the sake of few individuals ' , alcohol has to be banned for all .
Argumentative	 therefore , because the government has been trusted with the duty to make informed decisions instead of the individuals and to protect the individual , it is right to allow them to ban alcohol if they believe it is very harmful .
Argumentative	 alcohol is a contributory factor to a huge proportion of disputes and distress in society .
Argumentative	 it also contributes to the psychological problems of the alcohol consumer children .
Argumentative	 while the problem might not be connected to one individual in society , it is important that laws protect those , who might abuse their rights and with this hurt others .
Argumentative	 currently in the us alone , there is an estimated 6.6 million children under, which live in households with at least one alcoholic parent .
Argumentative	 it was never the fault of these children that others started to drink and harm them .
Argumentative	 according to psychological studies many of the children coming from alcohol abuse families have problems such as low self-esteem , loneliness , guilt , feelings of helplessness , fears of abandonment , and chronic depression .
Argumentative	 children of alcoholics in some cases even feel responsible for the problems of the alcoholic and may think they created the problem .
Argumentative	 alcohol is also a great contributor not only to psychological , but also to physical damage .
Argumentative	 many times , alcohol is an easy excuse for domestic abusers .
Argumentative	 the incidence of domestic abuse in households , where there is alcohol abuse is a lot higher and the abusers name the effects of alcohol as their main cause of violence .
Argumentative	 with taking away alcohol we take away the fuel of many of the abusers , thus protecting third involved parties .
Argumentative	 a ban of alcohol would have a great impact on the health of every individual .
Argumentative	 alcohol and especially alcohol abuse are very common problems in today 's society .
Argumentative	 long lasting abuse of substances leads to many chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis , damage to liver cells , ; pancreatitis , inflammation of the pancreas , ; various cancers , including liver , mouth , throat , larynx , the voice box , and esophagus ; high blood pressure ; and psychological disorders .
Argumentative	 with a ban of alcohol we would very much lower the rates of consumption , as already current drug laws show .
Argumentative	 even though drugs have a similar effect as alcohol , because of the risk of consequences when using those substances .
Argumentative	 therefore in general the number of alcohol addiction would sink and cause also less of a financial health burden .
Argumentative	 according to the us alone , the economic cost of alcohol abuse inwas 184.6 billion dollars .
Argumentative	 this is a burden which many state budgets have to bear .
Argumentative	 therefore if this cost can be prevented , the lives of people improved , by not getting the chronic diseases , we should do so .
