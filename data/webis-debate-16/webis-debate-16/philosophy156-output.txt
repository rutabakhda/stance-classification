Non-Argumentative	the issue of when a child is mature enough to consent to various decisions is a complicated one and this debate focusses on just one part; those decisions that relate to their medical well-being.
Non-Argumentative	 there are a number of areas where the consent of parents is required – surgery, transplants, blood transfusion and others where the child is not able to give consent because they are too young; circumcision being one obvious example.
Non-Argumentative	 many jurisdictions stress that the child should be involved wherever possible but, the decision lies with the parents, or in their absence, a court.
Non-Argumentative	put simply, the doctor is free to use their medical judgement in an emergency situation – an arrival in an emergency room or accident and emergency department but where there is time available to ask for consent it must be sought from both the young person and their parents.
Non-Argumentative	for example the general medical council in the uk sets out;in many case, parents are happy to take the advice of doctors for their children, just as they would for themselves.
Non-Argumentative	 however, and this is the focus of this debate, there are occasions where there is a conflict between the values or beliefs of the parent(s) and the general consensus of medical opinion.
Non-Argumentative	 the contention of some doctors is that it is unfair for the parents to make a decision, that could cost the child her life, and that she may not have taken that decision later in life.
Non-Argumentative	this is further complicated by the fact that many children, especially younger children, share the views of their parents, somewhat uncritically.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore, the doctor and the courts face the question of whether the doctor is able to overrule the opinions of both, let us say, a teenager and their parents.
Non-Argumentative	 this will focus on the issue of blood transfusion for teenage children of parents who are members of the jehovah’s witnesses (jws).
Non-Argumentative	the issue of whether the rejection of transfused blood is in and of itself sensible is irrelevant both legally and in this debate.
Non-Argumentative	.
Non-Argumentative	  nobody disputes that the lack of medical action is a risk in medical terms – and one that may lead to death.
Non-Argumentative	 the issue for debate is whether the religious views of the parents or the medical opinion of the doctors should have primacy in determining the correct course of action.
Non-Argumentative	 the debate is about who should have the right to decide, not what that decision should be.
Non-Argumentative	 this is considered as an issue of conscience, the implications for the soul of the patient are not considered here.
Non-Argumentative	although this debate relates to blood transfusion and jws – we will assume that proposition have defined it as such – it’s principles would apply to other, similar, disputes such as whether parents have the right to reject organs from a person of another race or reject drugs that have been tested on animals.
Argumentative	 asking doctors to take other considerations into account is not only a breach of their professional integrity , it also poses grave risks for society .
Argumentative	 they are being asked , in this situation , to allow the opinions of a third party take precedence over the wellbeing of their patient .
Argumentative	 if this were a younger relative with their eye on an inheritance or a distant sibling seeking to settle an old score , the dangers would be all too apparent .
Argumentative	 in this instance , the motivation may be well-intentioned but it is no more reasonable .
Argumentative	 allowing relatives to say `` well , what i think you should do is x '' in defiance of medical opinion is fraught with dangers .
Argumentative	 if a relative decided on behalf of a patient to reject chemotherapy in favour of prayer or expressed their preference for shamanic rituals rather than medication , why not let them .
Argumentative	 after all their intent is just as compassionate and their reasoning as solid .
Argumentative	 we expect the legal and medical professions to accord particular protection to children against the actions of others that could harm them including , in extremis , their parents .
Argumentative	 it is difficult to see what could be a more flagrant example of possible harm than allowing your child to die when an available remedy could save their life .
Argumentative	 the protection of children is treated differently from how we address the needs of adults .
Argumentative	 the very fact that their parents ' consent for procedures is required acknowledges that fact .
Argumentative	 we further accept that when that consent is questionable - when the parents may not be acting in the best interests of the child - that right may be revoked .
Argumentative	 in most instances of such revocation , if the parent is an addict or mentally incapable of a particular decision , such a decision can be determined well in advance .
Argumentative	 however , in this instance , the status of the parent has not previously been an issue .
Argumentative	 however , the same principles should surely apply .
Argumentative	 for example , if a parent has been denied access rights to their child by a court , they would have no standing in making any such decision .
Argumentative	 if their child is a ward of the court , the same would apply .
Argumentative	 society has a general duty to at least keep children alive until they reach the age of majority and remove all possible obstacles to that happening .
Argumentative	 we do not allow parents to give their children the right to pursue other harmful activities or to take unnecessary risks with their safety ; the principle of a presumption of protection would also apply here .
