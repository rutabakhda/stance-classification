Non-Argumentative	the united states initiated operation enduring freedom on the 7th octoberless than a month after the attack on the world trade center and pentagon.
Non-Argumentative	 the taliban had been sheltering osama bin laden, the mastermind of those attacks, and refused to extradite him.
Non-Argumentative	 the conflict was swift with kabul falling on the 13th november to the northern alliance, a group who had been fighting the taliban and had us help.
Non-Argumentative	 bin laden however evaded the united states and escaped to pakistan but has since been killed.
Non-Argumentative	there was however a need to keep the peace and the international security assistance force was established in kabul ondecember 2001.
Non-Argumentative	 nato took over command of isaf onaugustand its mission was expanded to include the whole country.
Non-Argumentative	 unfortunately the united states and nato did not succeed in destroying the taliban who managed to regroup in pakistan and begin fighting again in afghanistan in 2003.
Non-Argumentative	 losses for nato and us forces in afghanistan reached a peak ofinand so far there have been a total offatalities.
Non-Argumentative	 casualty rates for civilians are of course many times higher with at leastsince 2005.
Non-Argumentative	 nato however is now getting out; on the 18th june the control over military operations in afghanistan was handed over to the afghanis and on the same day the taliban indicated a willingness to negotiate indicating that perhaps an end is in sight.
Non-Argumentative	 regardless of whether these negotiations go ahead nato intends to have mostly left the country by the end of 2014.
Non-Argumentative	 so it is a good time to consider if nato has been successful.
Non-Argumentative	what constitutes success for nato in afghanistan?
Non-Argumentative	 there are several different threads to what might be considered a success.
Non-Argumentative	 the most obvious are whether there has been success in the objectives set by the united states at the outset of the conflict and whether nato has succeeded in the remit of its mission in afghanistan.
Non-Argumentative	george bush initially stated that us actions were “designed to disrupt the use of afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the taleban regime.”
Non-Argumentative	 this is a very limited objective that could be said to have been rapidly met but it is not really the objective for having nato forces in afghanistan.
Non-Argumentative	annex i of the bonn agreement inthat established the international force in afghanistan recognised that “the responsibility for providing security and law and order throughout the country resides with the afghans themselves”.
Non-Argumentative	 the nato force was to “assist in the maintenance of security for kabul and its surrounding areas” and was later expanded to the rest of the country through un security council resolutionin 2003.
Non-Argumentative	 the only non-security element mentioned for the force was at the end “it would also be desirable if such a force were to assist in the rehabilitation of afghanistan’s infrastructure.”
Non-Argumentative	but while it is clearly the most important element just limiting the question to security does ignore other justifications for nato’s mission that have at various times been given; to ensure human rights, to enable the growth of democracy, and rebuilding the country all of which should be at least considered.
Argumentative	 `` nato 's primary objective in afghanistan is to enable the afghan authorities to provide effective security across the country and ensure that the country can never again be a safe haven for terrorists . ''
Argumentative	 the invasion of afghanistan was initially about destroying al-qaeda and with the killing of osama bin laden inin pakistan this objective has been met .
Argumentative	 there are still efforts to destroy al qaeda but these have mostly moved out of afghanistan and into pakistan and other countries such as yemen .
Argumentative	 nato has also brought afghanistan to the point where the afghani 's can look after themselves and exercise their own security .
Argumentative	 on 18th june afghanistan took over the lead from nato on security nationwide having previously been taking control district by district .
Argumentative	 handing over security also itself improves security with afghanis in kandahar saying `` now that the foreigners are gone , the security situation in the city and in the districts is much better '' .
Argumentative	 nato is also ensuring that peace and security remain in afghanistan as they draw down by opening up negotiations with the taliban .
Argumentative	 peace can only be assured by bringing together the sides so that almost everyone accepts the status quo and does not want to destroy that status quo through force .
Argumentative	 united states officials say `` we have long said this conflict wo n't be won on the battlefield '' with the deputy national security advisor , ben rhodes , adding `` the united states will be supporting a process that is fundamentally afghan-led '' meaning that nato is no longer key to the process .
Argumentative	 nato handing over control to the afghans and eventually withdrawing entirely will make peace more likely to succeed as the taliban `` considerers it its religious and national duty to gain independence from the occupation '' with this goal it wants `` to support a political and peaceful solution '' .
Argumentative	 lasting peace is then only possible when nato leaves .
Argumentative	 some of the biggest benefits of the nato occupation have been through the increase in democracy and human rights .
Argumentative	 while these were not specific aims of the nato mission they were among the goals set out by the united nations .
Argumentative	 there have been two presidential elections , one inthe other in, and two parliamentary elections ,andnone have been perfect but it is a clear advance from no elections at all .
Argumentative	 the most notable human rights increase has been in women 's rights .
Argumentative	 under the taliban afghanistan strictly limited the activities of women but today 27.3 % of the representatives in the parliament are women , better than in the uk or us , and the first female governor is in office .
Argumentative	 the literacy rate is still low but they now make up 36.6 % of those in primary school up from almost nothing .
Argumentative	 there have been similar gains in other human rights such as a reduction in the use of corporal punishments such as amputating hands for theft .
Argumentative	 the ` rehabilitation ' of afghanistan 's infrastructure has not been an immense success due to the continuing bombing campaign which inevitably damages infrastructure but there have been big economic benefits from the nato presence .
Argumentative	 there have been more than 4,000 schools built and 175,000 teachers trained , although more is needed this is an immense boost to education in afghanistan .
Argumentative	 another benefit of increased stability is a renewal of outside investment , from china in particular .
Argumentative	 china has been investing billions , several mining firms have made a $ 4.4 billion investment in one project ; an immense undeveloped copper reserve in aynak .
Argumentative	 in total there is more than $billion being invested in infrastructure by afghanistan 's asian neighbours , as these investments are looking for profit they are clearly believed to be sustainable , by comparison the united states has only funded $ 1.6 billion since.
