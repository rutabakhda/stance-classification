Argumentative	there are realistic ways a policy of denying healthcare access to smokers could be carried out .
Argumentative	 insurance companies already ask lots of health-related questions , often including whether their client is a smoker , when assessing life insurance premiums .
Argumentative	 in these cases , you are required to give details of your lifestyle by law .
Argumentative	 of course , some people do not , however this is to be expected since no law is one hundred per cent effective .
Argumentative	 sanctions exist to discourage dishonest behaviour .
Argumentative	 a similar model could be put in place requiring a declaration of smoker status to the health authority .
Argumentative	 indeed , many doctors already enquire about their patients ' smoking statuses on an informal basis .
Argumentative	 it is also particularly hard to lie about being a smoker for two reasons .
Argumentative	 first , other people inevitably see you smoking .
Argumentative	 this means an abundance of witnesses in the case of a dispute , and thus a disincentive to lie .
Argumentative	 second , people require doctors to undertake detailed examinations for treatment purposes , thereby allowing them to see obvious outward signs of smoking : tar deposits , tar in cough , yellowed fingernails , etc, smokers contribute a disproportionately large amount to the cost of healthcare .
Argumentative	 they are a drain on resources .
Argumentative	 in the uk it is estimated that up to 9,500 beds are blocked daily by smokers , and that up to eight million doctor consultations are required on their behalf each year .
Argumentative	 a well-informed smoker , unable or unwilling to quit , might assume an increased risk for himself but he would also be indirectly increasing the likelihood of others being unable to access necessary healthcare and this is not fair .
Argumentative	 allowing smokers to take scarce beds or organs needed for transplants - that could otherwise go to those suffering from genuine misfortunes - is an unjust allocation of resources .
