Non-Argumentative	the united nations was established inby means of the charter of the united nations.
Non-Argumentative	 the membership of the organisation currently comprises almost every recognised state in the world.
Non-Argumentative	 every member state is represented in the general assembly where it holds a single vote.
Non-Argumentative	 this forum holds debates on any matter within the scope of the charter and passes decisions by a simple majority or exceptionally a two thirds majority of members present and voting.
Non-Argumentative	 under articleof the charter, the security council has primary responsibility for "the maintenance of international peace and security".
Non-Argumentative	 this mandate includes the authorisation of the use of force for purposes other than self-defence.
Non-Argumentative	 this body includespermanent members or the p5; the united states, the united kingdom, china, france, and russia.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition,seats on the security council are held by non-permanent member states that are elected for a term ofyears.
Non-Argumentative	 although decisions of the security council are made by the affirmative vote ofof themembers, the p5 hold the power of veto over any such decision.
Argumentative	 proponents of its removal argue that the conditions under which the p5 were granted their veto power are now out-dated and unfair whilst opponents maintain that it is a necessary element in the maintenance of international peace and security.
Argumentative	purported u.n. actions that would clearly antagonise a member of the p5 never even reach the security council ; such is the awareness that the veto would stall its progress .
Argumentative	 the statistics of the numbers of vetoes passed at any particular point in un history does not reveal the true defect of the institutional arrangement .
Argumentative	 in an attempt to circumvent this , countries and military alliances are forced to act unilaterally .
Argumentative	 nato initiated military action against yugoslavia , under the imprimatur of the united states and the united kingdom , without receiving security council authorisation .
Argumentative	 it had become evident that any un military involvement would be vetoed by both china and russia .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the silence of the security council whilst russia launched a relentless and brutal campaign against chechnya was deafening .
Argumentative	 nevertheless , there is little that can be done such is the absolute power of the veto that russia and the other p5 members have .
Argumentative	 funding contributions to the united nations should directly relate to the influence that member organizations thereafter have on its actions ; with the veto in place , this is no longer the case .
Argumentative	 the permanent five , as the group of nations granted the most constitutional power in the united nations , should contribute a proportional amount of resources to the institution .
Argumentative	 initially , this was the case -- however , by, japan was contributingper cent of the un budget , second only to that of the united states  .
Argumentative	 in third place , contributingper cent , was germany , another state lacking a veto power and any ability to overrule the interests of p5 nations , all bar one of whom contributed less to the un budget  .
Argumentative	 furthermore , india and brazil , whilst not contributing financially to the degree of japan and germany , have permitted large swathes of their armed forces to join u.n. peacekeeping operations to fulfil the mandates handed down by the security council .
Argumentative	 despite these financial and military contributions , the states concerned get no greater say in the interests and actions of the organization .
Argumentative	 a fairer , more equitable model would insist on a greater proportionality between one 's contribution to the united nations and one 's ability to influence its actions .
Argumentative	  blum , ibid all the security council members know that at some point there is going to have to be reform of the council .
Argumentative	 this will most likely mean more members being admitted to the council .
Argumentative	 the three countries whose grasp on the security council is tenuous due to their relative power having declined ; uk , france and russia , will likely be willing to give up their veto in order to retain their seats .
Argumentative	 the united states and china would then have to follow or face the rest of the international community and devalue the united nations .
Argumentative	 a half-way house would probably be agreed where the veto could be retained in a few areas much as it has been within the european union decision making process .
Argumentative	 this could then be slowly eroded over time .
