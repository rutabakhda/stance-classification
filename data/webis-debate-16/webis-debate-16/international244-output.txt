Non-Argumentative	turkey has had a trade agreement with the european union for over forty years, and first applied for membership of europe’s premier club nearly forty years ago.
Non-Argumentative	 until ten years ago these requests were politely resisted; turkey was never turned down outright but the eu made it clear that massive political and economic reforms would be needed before entry could even be considered.
Non-Argumentative	 in 1999, however, eu leaders unanimously accepted turkey as a candidate country, yet negotiations about entry did not begin until 2005.
Non-Argumentative	sincethe eu accession negotiations for croatia and iceland have advanced rapidly, but only one out ofchapters has been completed with turkey;have yet to be opened at all.
Non-Argumentative	 this has led to turkish suspicion that the eu is not really serious about ever including it.
Non-Argumentative	 this suspicion seemed to be confirmed in november 2002, when valery giscard d’estaing, a former president of france, declared that turkey was an asiatic nation that should never be allowed to join the european union.
Non-Argumentative	 since then it has become the policy of france, germany and austria to oppose turkish membership of the eu.
Non-Argumentative	 they and some politicians in other eu states would prefer to offer a privileged partnership short of full membership; something which turkey rejects.
Argumentative	 greece and cyprus do not reject the prospect of turkish membership outright, but are insistent that progress should be dependent upon turkey abandoning support for northern cyprus.
Argumentative	the eu has welcomed poorer entrants than turkey without disaster ; ireland , spain , portugal and greece were all much poorer than the eu average when they joined and all are now well integrated and much more prosperous .
Argumentative	 disastrous migration was forecast in their cases too , but did not occur .
Argumentative	 nor is turkey as poor as has been suggested ; turkey with a gdp per capita of $inis richer than romania at $and bulgaria with a gdp per capita of $both of which are already members .
Argumentative	 turkey 's economy is also in the process of reform , including the restructuring of its banking system and imf programmes ; in the next few years this process will allow for faster , more sustained growth .
Argumentative	 turkey provides a large new market for eu goods ; should it be accepted into the single market the economic benefits would not be solely limited to that country .
Argumentative	 turkey 's inclusion in the eu would not threaten other members with overwhelming economic or immigration issues .
Argumentative	 it is possible that , as has happened with bulgaria and romania , that a delay is enacted for the schengen passport-free zone .
Argumentative	 this would give both the current eu and turkey a period of time to adjust .
Argumentative	 romania and bulgaria , who have by far the worst human rights ' records , were prioritized over turkey when they were granted the right of accession , joining the eu in.
Argumentative	 the eu rewarded states that have made a big effort to democratize and change policy in order to be allowed in to the eu .
Argumentative	 by essentially procrastinating on turkey 's case , the eu are discouraging turkey from making the required changes to their legislature and norms and thus hindering their chances of accession .
Argumentative	 countries such as hungary , poland , and the czech republic were pressurized to reform at a rapid pace after being promised by the eu they would likely be in the eu in a relatively short period of time ; turkey has been given no such promises .
Argumentative	 turkey should have even more ` right ' to be in the eu as these states , as it formally applied for membership long before these states and should thus be given priority over them .
Argumentative	 turkey is a key geo-political strategic ally to the west and should be integrated fully in order to ensure its continued cooperation .
Argumentative	 `` turkey is a secular muslim democracy and a crucial ally for the west .
Argumentative	 the eastern flank of nato , straddling europe and asia , it played a critical role in containing the soviet union during the cold war .
Argumentative	 in the 1990s , it helped monitor saddam hussein and protect iraqi kurds by permitting u.s. warplanes to use its bases .
Argumentative	 after the september attacks , it became a staging area for coalition forces in afghanistan , where turkish forces eventually assumed overall command of the international stabilization force .
Argumentative	 turkey continues to be a pivotal partner in the fight against al qaeda and other terrorist groups , despite attacks by radical islamists at home . ''
Argumentative	 turkey was promised a chance to join the eu by a unanimous vote at the helsinki summit in, when its candidacy was unanimously accepted after three decades of consistent turkish requests .
Argumentative	 as a candidate country turkey should be allowed in once it meets the membership criteria which were first set out in the copenhagen european council of.
Argumentative	 these were stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights and respect for and protection of minorities , the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union and the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political , economic & monetary union .
Argumentative	 clearly economic and political reforms are necessary , but that is true of all states attempting to join the eu and should not be used as an excuse to backtrack now .
Argumentative	 it would be hypocritical to apply one set of criteria to central and eastern european states and another to turkey .
Argumentative	 such blatant hypocrisy would have consequences , if the eu is seen to break its promise to turkey it may turn a potential friend and partner into a suspicious and hostile neighbour .
