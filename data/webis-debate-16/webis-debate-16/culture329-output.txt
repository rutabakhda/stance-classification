Non-Argumentative	a faith school is a school that is run by a religious group, such as the catholic church.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk and many other western liberal democracies, the status quo is that some state schools are allowed to be faith schools in exchange for a small financial contribution towards the running of the school by the religious group running the school.
Non-Argumentative	 the religious group also has control over how many and which children it admits, including the freedom to ensure that the majority of its intake is of its faith.
Non-Argumentative	 they must follow the national curriculum but there is a lot of scope for including their own values in the education they provide.
Argumentative	 in this debate, the proposition wishes to completely remove faith schools from the education system.
Argumentative	since education is something that the state is obligated to provide , any organisation that provides education is a representative of the state , even in private education .
Argumentative	 if religious groups are allowed to run schools then this means they are acting on behalf of the state , which undermines the separation of religion and the state , which the proposition believes is inherently harmful and undermining to the concept of democracy .
Argumentative	 even the archbishop of canterbury believes having greater separation of church and state would be beneficial arguing `` i think that the notion of the monarch as supreme governor has outlived its usefulness . ''
Argumentative	 this separation has to include the education of children .
Argumentative	 the state should not allow the education of a child to be polluted by what is tantamount to brainwashing .
Argumentative	 amartya sen argues `` under this system , young children are placed in the domain of singular affiliations well before they have the ability to reason about different systems of identification that may compete for their attention . ''
Argumentative	 instead they have to learn about all religions to encourage tolerance .
Argumentative	 it is totally acceptable for children to have religious education outside of school and to brought to places of worship but school is a place of education and they should be given an education that is not tainted by trying to ensure that they grow up with a certain attitude towards their religion .
Argumentative	 when the government allows religion to act on its behalf , it confuses the role of the state and the role of religious groups .
Argumentative	 as it stands , religious groups do not appear to be truly answerable to the state and , therefore , it is unclear whether they or the government are the higher authority .
Argumentative	 for example in the uk faith schools set their own admission standards and increasingly have control over their curriculum , which in other state funded schools is set by the government , as well as they are being converted to academies .
Argumentative	 this legislation would make it completely clear that the state is the ultimate authority .
Argumentative	 faith schools continuously perform better than normal schools .
Argumentative	 this creates a feeling amongst parents and children of wanting to be included in these faith schools .
Argumentative	 they are , however , excluded on the basis of their religion .
Argumentative	 this will create feelings of unfair exclusion , which will lead to animosity towards the religion running the school and , by extension , people of that religion .
Argumentative	 as a result of this% of people in the uk believe that there should be no state funding for faith schools .
Argumentative	 it would be easy to convert faith schools to normal schools .
Argumentative	 the majority of faith schools are already tied closely to the state education system making it easy to convert them into normal schools which are not faith based .
Argumentative	 much of the curriculum is the same or very similar so the change would not be difficult for teachers .
Argumentative	 in england for example therefaith schools that are also state schools andthat are academies .
Argumentative	 these schools would simply change to having the same systems as any other school and admission would become open to all .
