Non-Argumentative	transcanada keystone pipeline filed an application infor a presidential permit with the department of state to build and operate the keystone xl project.
Non-Argumentative	the proposed keystone xl project would consist of a 1,700-mile crude oil pipeline and related facilities that would be used largely to transport western canadian sedimentary basin crude oil from an oil supply hub in alberta, canada to delivery points in oklahoma and texas.
Non-Argumentative	 the project would also be capable of transporting u.s. crude from places like north dakota and montana to those delivery points.
Non-Argumentative	 the project could transport up to 830,000 barrels per day and is estimated to cost $7 billion.
Non-Argumentative	 if permitted, it would begin operation in 2013, with the actual date dependant on the necessary permits, approvals, and authorizations.
Non-Argumentative	 the project has generated significant debate in the united states regarding the extraction and use of oil from alberta's tar sands, which generally results in greater environmental issues and greenhouse gas emissions than conventional reservoir extraction.
Non-Argumentative	 pipelines are also fairly vulnerable to spills.
Non-Argumentative	 but, supporters argue it will create 100,000 jobs and strengthen us energy independence from sources in unstable and unfriendly regions of the world.
Non-Argumentative	since the application was filed, the project has followed a confused bureaucratic path.
Non-Argumentative	 favoured by national republicans and pennsylvania democrats as well as labor unions, it has been opposed by the obama administration which held up approval of the project through the fall of 2011.
Non-Argumentative	 as of december of 2011, congressional republicans were looking to attach a bill approving the project to an extension of the payroll tax cut.
Non-Argumentative	 on the 18th januarythe state department denied the keystone xl pipeline a permit saying it had not had time to review the plans but at the same time the transcanada is allowed to resubmit the proposal with route changes.
Argumentative	Â currently , the united states imports nearly two-thirds of its petroleum , with the leading suppliers including nations such as nigeria , venezuela and saudi arabia .
Argumentative	 due to political instability and the difficult us relations with these nations , us supplies can not be considered secure , and with the results of research into alternative sources of energy being decades away from fruition the united states needs alternative sources of oil today .
Argumentative	 one option is canada , which is individually already the united states ' single largest energy supplier .
Argumentative	 canada 's known reserves totalbillion barrels , placing it third behind saudi arabia , but some estimates have put its total at as high astrillion barrels .
Argumentative	 the xl pipeline project would help bring this oil overland into the united states .
Argumentative	 on the canadian end , the increased market access would lead to rapid development , which in turn would increase canadian capacity to the level to which it could reach a much greater portion of us demand .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the united states enjoys close relations and an open border with canada , meaning that this oil will likely arrive without the strings attached that come from buying from venezuela or the middle east .
Argumentative	 in the case of the latter the pipeline would allow the us to disengage from the region to a degree .
Argumentative	 even if hypothetically canadian relations were to turn frosty , the existence of the pipeline would nevertheless ensure that the us would remain the only viable market .
Argumentative	 the xl pipeline project has the potential to create a large number of jobs , both in its construction , and in refining and processing at its terminal points within the united states .
Argumentative	 keystone pipelines has produced a report which indicates that the pipeline should create 118,000 jobs , with as many as 250,000 in total after spinoffs have been counted .
Argumentative	 labor unions have accepted this line and are aggressively lobbying for the pipeline , even though it means siding with republicans and against their own party .
Argumentative	 furthermore , politicians ranging from jon huntsman to bob casey have embraced the job-creating p  otential of the project .
Argumentative	 canada 's oil reserves will be of major strategic value in the next century .
Argumentative	 currently the united states is canada 's preferred trading partner and strategic ally , both because of a history of past cooperation , and because the us is both more willing and able to support canadian claims to the arctic than china .
Argumentative	 the pipeline would consolidate this relationship , ensuring that the development of canada 's reserves would occur with the american market in mind , because once built , it would be far more expensive to build a second pipeline than to simply use the existing one .
Argumentative	 the united states , is not however , canada 's only option .
Argumentative	 canada is determined to sell the oil one way or another , and an american refusal will not save the environment .
Argumentative	 what it will do is make canada look elsewhere .
Argumentative	 the canadian government publicly floated a joint-canadian-chinese pipeline proposal which would bring the oil to the pacific after the obama administration delayed consideration of the project until after.
Argumentative	 just as the keystone pipeline would lock canada into the us market , a decision to develop canadian reserves with the chinese market in mind would be difficult to reverse , and undermine the energy independence of the united states rather than secure it .
