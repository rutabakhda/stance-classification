Non-Argumentative	one of the great successes of the united nations has been the acceptance that interstate war is wrong, the acceptance that “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.
Non-Argumentative	 there is some debate about whether this has actually meant that there that there is actually less war, or indeed whether it will actually stop another world war from happening, but one thing it has done is make almost everyone recognise that waging war should be considered to be illegal.
Non-Argumentative	 now it is generally assumed that initiating a military action against another state can only be legal if there is backing from the united nations security council.
Non-Argumentative	yet there have been attempts to chip away at this concept.
Non-Argumentative	 innato intervened in kosovo without the authorisation of the security council because russia would not countenance intervention against its ally serbia.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states did not advance solid legal claims that it was legally entitled to engage in a conflict against serbia as a result of the ethnic cleansing occurring in kosovo.
Non-Argumentative	 nato did not see unsc authorisation or justify on the basis of self defense it simply ignored the international norm against intervention.
Non-Argumentative	 in doing so it may have changed that norm.
Non-Argumentative	the us and coalition of the willing’s invasion of iraq was another breach of this norm against interstate war that is not authorised by the security council or in self defense.
Non-Argumentative	 there was more adherence to norms against the use of military force than in the kosovo campaign; there were attempts to claim self defense, and george w. bush and tony blair went to the security council to try and gain assent to go to war.
Non-Argumentative	 when this failed they attempted to claim that a previous resolution, 1441, was sufficient authorisation to use force.
Non-Argumentative	 it is however generally accepted, except by the governments involved, that resolutiondid not by itself authorise force.
Non-Argumentative	since these interventions the concept that there may be a humanitarian reason to intervene has become more accepted.
Non-Argumentative	 the united nations has not gone for a full doctrine of humanitarian intervention but indid agree to a ‘responsibility to protect’ in which states accepted responsibility to protect against genocide and other crimes against humanity but the acceptance was simply to act, not explicitly an acceptance of the use of force.
Non-Argumentative	 this was used as justification in a nato action to protect benghazi in 2012, but this air assault, unlike kosovo or iraq, had un security council authorisation as russia and china abstained.
Non-Argumentative	although russia and china abstained in the case of libya on other issues where the united states might want to take action they have not been so obliging.
Non-Argumentative	 any attempt to attack iran, or syria, or north korea, or practically anywhere for any reason is liable to be blocked.
Non-Argumentative	 the result from the point of view of the americans is that the security council is broken and as such they may need to go it alone, or in a coalition with other like-minded states.
Non-Argumentative	 if it is action to prevent atrocities should it be considered legal if the intervening power can’t get authorization from its peers?
Argumentative	 when a massacre is about to happen it is legal to intervene to prevent that massacre .
Argumentative	 the ` responsibility to protect ' which was accepted by the un in.
Argumentative	 resolution 60/1 at theworld summit stated , there was international responsibility `` to help to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
Argumentative	 in this context , we are prepared to take collective action in a timely and decisive manner . ''
Argumentative	 though this will only happen `` should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations '' .
Argumentative	 this is most certainly the case in syria where the national authorities are the ones doing much of the killing .
Argumentative	 it must be proved that the syrian regime is responsible for the attacks ; the us and uk say there is such evidence but so far the link is not crystal clear .
Argumentative	 even the uk government accepts that there must be `` convincing evidence , generally accepted by the international community as a whole , of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale , requiring immediate and urgent relief '' .
Argumentative	 as the doctrine states peaceful means must have been tried -- and in syria after two years of conflict we can safely say a peaceful resolution is not in sight .
Argumentative	 and the use of force must be proportionate -- which since there is no plan for a full scale invasion in syria it will be .
Argumentative	 a second possible justification for intervention is when the state that is intervening against is itself breaking international law such as the chemical weapons convention or the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
Argumentative	 the intervention would then be to force compliance of the treaty ; this would mean forcible disarmament of illegal weapons .
Argumentative	 in the case of syria the country could be deemed to have violated its own legal obligations due to its having broken thegeneva protocol that bans the use of chemical weapons .
Argumentative	 since manufacturing and possession of these weapons is banned if it is considered that having such weapons is a ` gross violation of international law ' then a limited use of force to destroy these weapons could be considered to be legal .
Argumentative	 this could be considered to be analogous to the police stepping in to confiscate a banned weapon , with no police internationally other states have to be the ones to step in .
Argumentative	 the international prohibition on the use of force has always been honoured in large part in the breach leading to the question of whether it should really be considered to be binding international law at all .
Argumentative	 almost every major country has launched an illegal offensive action at some point ; the usa has been involved in kosovo and iraq , the uk and france in attacking egypt in, china in attacking vietnam in, and russia , as the ussr , in attacking afghanistan also in.
Argumentative	 in each instance of unilateral offensive action there will be justifications and a ` smoke screen ' to make the conflict appear to be legal when in fact it is not .
Argumentative	 major powers should simply admit that they do not regard the prohibition of the use of force as binding on them .
Argumentative	 even without admitting it because international law is based upon state behaviour the use of force is legal as michael j glennon suggests `` the consent of united nations member states to the general prohibition against the use of force , as expressed in the charter , has in this way been supplanted by a changed intent as expressed in deeds .
