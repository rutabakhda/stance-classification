Non-Argumentative	turkey is a democracy, or at least it is usually considered as such.
Non-Argumentative	 it is the only middle eastern, and only country with a muslim majority, in nato, and it is a long term applicant to the european union.
Non-Argumentative	 however its slow progress in that regard is perhaps an indication that its democracy is not quite as entrenched as many would like.
Non-Argumentative	 turkey is a democratic, secular, and constitutional republic, but there are republicans who believe that all of these are threatened by the prime minister recep tayyip erdoğan and his justice and development party (akp) which have been in power for a decade.
Non-Argumentative	 until now however concern has not turned into outright protest, and while other areas of the middle east underwent revolutionary convulsions turkey has remained high and dry often being seen, not least by turkey’s leaders, as a model for the new emerging democracies in other parts of the middle east.
Non-Argumentative	on the 28th maya small group of activists attempted to stop the clearance of trees for the redevelopment of a park in istanbul.
Non-Argumentative	 the police response was heavy handed using tear gas resulting in growing protests around the park.
Non-Argumentative	 attempts a few days later to evict these protestors resulted in injuries to several people; again the result is a surge in the protests rather than the unrest dying down.
Non-Argumentative	 over the weekend the protests became much larger in scale centered on taksim square from which after a battle with demonstrators the police retreated.
Non-Argumentative	 the protests spread across much of the country and according to the turkish doctors’ association the clashes with police have left 1,000 people injured in istanbul andin ankara.
Non-Argumentative	although the protests were sparked by development of a green space the driving force behind the protest is democracy and fears about the authoritarianism of the ruling party.
Non-Argumentative	 protesters argue “he's [erdoğan] a dictator.
Non-Argumentative	 whenever we want to say our beliefs he always says: 'no you can't speak.
Non-Argumentative	 you are lying and you are very little.'”
Non-Argumentative	 they link the destruction of the park with taking away public spaces and observers contend that "erdogan does not listen to anyone any more, not even to members of his own party.”
Non-Argumentative	 they believe the protests will force the prime minister to listen, others however say they won’t go away until he resigns.
Non-Argumentative	erdoğan’s response has perhaps been predictable, heaping blame on the opposition and social media; “there is now a menace which is called twitter… the best examples of lies can be found there.
Non-Argumentative	 to me, social media is the worst menace to society.”
Non-Argumentative	 a clear parallel to the ‘arab spring’ in tunisia which some called a ‘twitter revolution’.
Non-Argumentative	 however of course there are immense differences; even if it has its faults turkey is a democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 erdoğan has won three terms as prime minister which shows his popularity.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover the akp stays in power not because of the army – which is generally linked to the idea of a secular turkish state that erdoğan has undermined – as was the case in egypt but because of his popular support.
Non-Argumentative	 attempts to get him to stand down as a result of protests, demonstrations, and violence might very well be considered to be anti-democratic.
Non-Argumentative	there is then a question about whether turkey is a democracy and perhaps about democracy itself.
Non-Argumentative	 democracy can clearly be many different things.
Non-Argumentative	 at its most basic it is rule by the majority of the people but we usually consider it to be broader.
Non-Argumentative	 instead of just rule by the majority we consider democracy to be ‘liberal democracy’ which claus offe considers to have four basic elements; statehood – it must be within a defined territory with a functioning government in this case an effective and legitimate government, rule of law which limits the exercise of state power and provides personal rights to the people, political competition between contending parties that contest elections, and the rulers must be accountable not just through elections but also the media and other methods of removing the elite.
Non-Argumentative	  as the first definition is easily met even by a mob we will look at the second.
Argumentative	 the rule of law , limits on the power of the state , and the provision of personal rights are key to any country being considered to be a liberal democracy but these are being undermined in turkey .
Argumentative	 this is most noticeable when it comes to freedom of the press .
Argumentative	 turkey 's press freedoms have been in decline .
Argumentative	 it is a dismal 154th on the press freedom index and most notable is that it is the country with the most imprisoned journalists with at leastimprisoned , mostly without having been convicted and as a result of their work .
Argumentative	 the lack of freedom of the press and how cowed the press is has been shown in the recent rioting ; cnn covered the protests live , at the same time its turkish language subsidiary cnn turk was broadcasting a cooking show .
Argumentative	 turkey has been heading towards being a one party , even a one person , state .
Argumentative	 erdoğan is intending to change the constitution is an attempt to institutionalise this .
Argumentative	 his new presidency would have the power to issue decrees with force of law , dissolve parliament and call elections , and to command the military .
Argumentative	 the attempt to change to a presidential system is clearly a move to enable erdoğan to avoid the limit of three terms in much the same way as vladimir putin did by switching jobs .
Argumentative	 a presidential system is not bad in principle but it should not be simply used as a vehicle for a particular politician .
Argumentative	 moreover any change of such a magnitude in a democratic country should be done only with popular consent -- something that this change does not have .
Argumentative	 in a februarypoll 65.8 % of turks favoured keeping the parliamentary system and only 21.2 % were in favour of a change to a presidential system .
Argumentative	 under the akp turkey has effectively become a one party state ; this means that there is not the competition necessary to make turkey a genuine liberal democracy .
Argumentative	 yes alternative parties exist but this does not mean they are going to get any power any time soon if the government can help it .
Argumentative	 the akp has been able to get twice as many votes as its nearest rival making it by far the dominant party .
Argumentative	 the party consolidates power and there are signs that competition in the party is more important than with other parties .
Argumentative	 the rioting across the country has shown this in several ways .
Argumentative	 first the resort to violent and street protest shows the opposition do n't think they can oust the akp at the ballot box .
Argumentative	 secondly the response from the leaders of the akp have been mixed .
Argumentative	 while erdoğan has vehemently condemned the protests while president abdullah gül has taken a more nuanced line saying `` democracy is not just about elections '' and that `` if there are objections , there is nothing more natural than voicing them '' effectively endorsing some protest .
Argumentative	 the trigger for the rioting ; construction projects building over a park and a square are a good analogy for the government as a whole .
Argumentative	 the akp government does not care for public opinion and is happy to push through projects without reference to it .
Argumentative	 in the case of taksim square the government did not consult about plans to bulldoze the park despite it being the site of a massacre inmaking it a place of historical significance .
Argumentative	 a court ruling to stop construction was also ignored .
Argumentative	 it is the same with legislation , the controversial changes to alcohol laws were only proposed a month before they were passed and debate was limited to two days , while some important business particularly involving day to day running of foreign and defence has very little oversight .
Argumentative	 the akp is not just making turkey authoritarian it is making it an islamic authoritarian state .
Argumentative	 since aamendment to the constitution turkey has been a secular state .
Argumentative	 recently turkey rushed through restrictions on the sale of alcohol prohibiting sale overnight .
Argumentative	 more worryingly than minor restrictions is a decline in gender equality and respect for religious minorities ; in, the year the akp came to power turkey was ranked 63rd in the un 's gender empowerment measure , byit had dropped to 101st out ofcountries .
Argumentative	 without respect for these groups it is difficult to see how turkey can be considered a liberal democracy that provides for equal and personal rights .
