Non-Argumentative	to mark the 70th anniversary of the death of the turkish republic’s founder, kemal atatürk, in november 2008, journalist and documentary filmmaker can dündar set out to produce, “the complete story of atatürk [which] has been told neither to turkey nor to the rest of the world.”
Non-Argumentative	 showing the “complete story” on the silver screen meant showing atatürk in his full humanity, including his fondness for women and alcohol.
Non-Argumentative	 although some audiences argued there was nothing new about atatürk in the documentary, it attracted fierce criticism on the grounds that it was insulting the country’s founder atatürk, and indirectly “turkishness” – an offence punishable by law under articleof the turkish penal code.
Non-Argumentative	some urged the public to refrain from watching the documentary, and under no circumstances allow children to see it, as it would belittle atatürk’s image in their minds.
Non-Argumentative	 others argued that the documentary was part of a plot against turkish secularism, believing that kemalists would lose their attachment to a leader who was a “drunken debaucher”.
Non-Argumentative	 two doctors even went to court in the hope of getting the film banned on the grounds that it shows atatürk as a chain smoker – showing smoking on film and television is illegal in turkey.
Non-Argumentative	 although the film was not banned, and perhaps also due to the fierce debate in the media, it attracted a wide audience.
Non-Argumentative	 can dündar’s personal website was blocked in schools at the request of the ministry of education who argued its content was “unfavourable” for students and teachers.
Non-Argumentative	we think all sides of national heroes, be it their smoking or drinking habits should be discussed.
Non-Argumentative	 the human side of national heroes might sound insulting to some, but unless we learn everything about them, our impression of our leaders would be unbalanced and highly biased.
Non-Argumentative	 by criticising dündar to this extent, the turkish audience, particularly the devote kemalists, showed that any criticism of atatürk was taboo and would not be welcome.
Non-Argumentative	 consequently, this fierce criticism was an example of how legitimate and important debate about a national hero could be deterred and how national heroes can be turned into taboos.
Argumentative	- irem kok and funda ustekno country is whiter than white , and often the creation of a country is a bloody event that involves mistakes , tragedy 's and outright massacres .
Argumentative	 while it is wrong to cover up and not apologise when mistakes are made or horrifying acts are committed the results of this action are likely to have consequences .
Argumentative	 these events may well be a sour point with neighbouring countries or even just those who feel that the country is not being honest about its past .
Argumentative	 turkey is an excellent example of this .
Argumentative	 almost everyone would agree that atatürk was a great leader and most would not consider that his habits make any difference to this .
Argumentative	 nor are they likely to judge turkey on the basis of the foibles of a long dead leader .
Argumentative	 however during the period just before atatürk became president the armenian genocide occurred , 1915-23 , which stains turkey 's foreign relations to this day , france has supported a law criminalising its denial , the us congress has several times had bills proposed highlighting the genocide and so damaging turkey 's relations with the u.s. and of course helping to freeze relations with armenia itself .
Argumentative	 history is not something that it is worth sacrificing freedom of speech and expression for .
Argumentative	 every individual should be free to voice their own views and this includes on areas that are important to the state such as its formation and national heros .
Argumentative	 in these areas there can be no compelling reason for keeping secrets or discouraging open inquiry and scholarship , there are no national security interests at stake , for most countries the individuals involved are dead .
Argumentative	 therefore the only thing being affected are individuals posthumous reputations and the state should not be protecting individuals reputations .
Argumentative	 someone 's reputation should stand on all of their deeds and acts based upon fact not just a cherry picked and idealised image set forth by the state .
Argumentative	 the foundation of islam is potentially an example of this .
Argumentative	 some scholars such as tom holland have attempted to show that the arab empire gave birth to islam rather than the other way around as it is traditionally understood .
Argumentative	 possible revisions of the early history of islam are extremely controversial but in light of the conflicts in the middle east and what is sometimes described as a clash of civilizations between the west and islam it is important that the period be studied .
Argumentative	 holland suggests that the prophet may have been much more influenced by christianity and judaism than is recognised by islam ; if there were such links might unearthing them not help to heal divides today ?
Argumentative	 history is important because of the way it shapes attitudes and identities .
Argumentative	 nationalism scholar benedict anderson has dubbed nations ` imagined communities ' because `` members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members , meet them , or even hear of them , yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion . ''
Argumentative	 this is the case with all large scale communities .
Argumentative	 `` the nation is always conceived as a deep , horizontal comradeship '' a fraternity for which members are willing to kill and die .
Argumentative	 this very willingness makes nationalism potentially dangerous and so it is much better to take a much more measured approach seeing the bad as well as the good .
Argumentative	 yet because the nation is an imagined community so it is possible for that imagining to be altered as is needed .
Argumentative	 turkey will not cease being the turkish nation simply because views of atatürk change as a result of some believing him to be a ` drunken debaucher ' .
Argumentative	 other countries have come to accept negative parts of their history with little consequence for their conception of the nation such as the uk 's acceptance that imperialism was in large part negative it simply creates a more nuanced view of the past .
Argumentative	 while the state may like to whitewash history to produce its own ` national history ' that sticks to one grand narrative that is about the state this is not history as it really is .
Argumentative	 while a national history full of patriotism may be good for instilling a love of the nation it is not much use at teaching anything else .
Argumentative	 in particular it is damaging to any attempt to teach analysis and the use of sources through history .
Argumentative	 history is for the most part not useful in and of itself , there are for example very few jobs directly working with history .
Argumentative	 rather teaching of history emphasises ` transferrable skills ' such as critical analysis , reasoning and argument all of which are suppressed if focused on one officially approved narrative .
Argumentative	 moreover having the darker side of a nation 's past both makes history more interesting and more believable and so making it more likely that those being taught it will relate to it .
Argumentative	 making the past look whiter than white simply makes it seem out of touch with reality .
Argumentative	 it makes for a poor teacher as history needs to ` teach by example ' and if that example is not a complex character that can be related to it has little relation to every day experience .
