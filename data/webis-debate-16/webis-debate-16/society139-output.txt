Non-Argumentative	  although arranged marriages are an entrenched cultural norm in many european-asian communities, there is still a lot of controversy over their practice.
Non-Argumentative	 although there are differences in the ways cultures carry them out, they can be broadly defined as forms of matrimony where the individuals involved are brought together by parents or family members, and not necessarily through their own choices.
Non-Argumentative	 however they are different from forced marriages in the sense that arrange marriages can involve the consent of the man and woman at the centre.
Non-Argumentative	 forced marriage was made punishable by law in the uk in early 2012.
Non-Argumentative	 before then laws were introduced in britain inallowing people to apply for forced marriage protection orders, where penalties for its breach can include up to two years in prison.
Non-Argumentative	 france also banned forced marriages and tried in recent years to discourage its continued usage via public education campaigns.
Non-Argumentative	 yet arranged marriages are practiced across societies in south asia, north africa and the middle east, particularly in communities that are predominantly hindu and muslim.
Non-Argumentative	 many diaspora communities in britain also practice them, and it was widespread among white europeans for centuries.
Non-Argumentative	 however many people in the west now see it as clashing far too much with more modern ideas of marriage where people often enter into matrimony independently of their families.
Non-Argumentative	  however, sympathisers claim that arranged marriages are not necessarily damaging or threatening to young men or women if they are not forced, and are a vital part of the cultural heritage and functioning of various diaspora communities in europe.
Non-Argumentative	    as the use of forced marriage already carries strict penalties, this debate will focus purely on arranged marriages.
Non-Argumentative	 the mechanism would be to outlaw marriages where the individuals at the centre have been introduced to each other by parents or relatives and had little or no contact with each other beforehand.
Non-Argumentative	 police officers, social workers and other public service workers would be made aware of the new regulations and be required to make those in their communities who might be vulnerable more aware of their rights.
Argumentative	  even if marriages are not made absolutely mandatory , covert family pressure can still propel people into unions where they will be unhappy .
Argumentative	 this is a form of restricted liberty as the consequences of people rebelling against arranged marriages can include being forced to leave home or suffering stigmatisation and reduced contact with family members .
Argumentative	 the stigma may also be the other way with the family feeling shame when their children reject their arrangements this in turn can lead to attempts at compulsion and even some cases like that of shafilea ahmed murder for the rejection of the marriage .
Argumentative	 clearly there is a thin line between arranged and forced marriages .
Argumentative	 although things like stigmatisation are harder to police than physical intimidation or violence , it is only right that the state steps in to regulate these harms , giving people the legal mandate to challenge the practice as well as to discourage relatives from attempting it from the outset .
Argumentative	 arranged marriages have not been a part of the cultures of most european countries for many years now .
Argumentative	 part of the reason for this is because ideas about marriage have become more progressive , with people accepting that men and women of any orientation should be allowed to choose their own partners .
Argumentative	 this was even the case during the socially conservative era of the 1950s , when it was generally accepted in countries like britain that people would court and meet their partners independently of their parents .
Argumentative	 arranged marriages also conform to a view of women in particular which regards them as chattel .
Argumentative	 this does not fit in with the type of egalitarianism many european countries seek to practice , and thus does not conform to western notions of individual rights .
Argumentative	 it is also hypocritical to adopt a double-standard with diaspora communities , turning a blind eye to practices which many other majority groups find reprehensible .
Argumentative	 the rights and norms of a country of block of countries such as the eu must apply to all .
Argumentative	 arranged marriages are often different when practiced in the home countries of many immigrant families in europe , where women often have networks of friends and relatives to rely on .
Argumentative	 the danger with allowing arranged marriages to happen in eu countries are that the women at the centre are often far more vulnerable , away from their own family , unfamiliar with the local language and fully reliant on their husband 's family .
Argumentative	 this makes it easier for domestic abuses to go undetected which is simply compounding problems of underreporting .
Argumentative	 it is therefore likely that there is more domestic violence within arranged marriages .
Argumentative	 this is shown even amongst women who still consented to arranged marriages but faced abuse from their husbands -- such as with the case of razia sodagar , whose husband abandoned her for another woman after she failed to fall pregnant .
Argumentative	 this illustrates how it is not always easy to draw a clear division between arranged marriages and forced marriages , as the former can often bear the same characteristics as the latter .
Argumentative	 it would therefore be safer to outlaw both .
