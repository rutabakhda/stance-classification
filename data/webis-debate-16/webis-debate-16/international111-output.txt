Non-Argumentative	the international criminal court (icc) began in 2002, formed under the rome statute  to try the most serious of war crimes when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc is an independent international organisation, outside of the united nations system, and runs on funding from state parties.
Non-Argumentative	 in order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the icc needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the united nations security council (being made up by the us, france, russia, china and the uk), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves.
Non-Argumentative	 currently, every referral to the court except one (and the only conviction to date) has been african.
Non-Argumentative	 the african union (au) has consistently criticized a ‘bias’ within the icc unfairly targeting african countries.
Non-Argumentative	 in januarythe organisation sent a letter to the icc highlighting “processes and procedures of the icc” one of the criticisms is the icc acts “without garnering the cooperation necessary to ensure the integrity of the proceedings”.
Non-Argumentative	 in individual statements african governments go further; ethiopia’s foreign minister tedros adhanom has said the icc’s “unfair treatment of africa and africans leaves much to be desired” and his kenyan counterpart amina mohamed accuses the icc of “treating us like toddlers”.
Non-Argumentative	 so the question becomes: is the icc biased against africa?
Argumentative	    all of the twenty-four people currently indicted are african .
Argumentative	 of the fifteen cases currently sitting before the court , all are african .
Argumentative	 this in and of itself points to a large disparity between africa and the rest of the world .
Argumentative	 it is also not at all true that africa is the only place worthy of investigation -- atrocities have occurred in the middle east , kosovo , chechnya , sri lanka and north korea , among others since the inception of the court .
Argumentative	 this is clearly because these other cases have powerful backers in the form of permanent security council members .
Argumentative	 the only conclusion to be drawn is that the icc feels more comfortable targeting africa then other regions where it is likely to run into opposition from powerful members of the international community .
Argumentative	 africa and its leaders are treated far more contemptuously by the court .
Argumentative	 the prospect of prosecuting barak obama for the killing of civilians by drones which amnesty international has suggested amount to war crimes or george w. bush for war crimes in iraq and afghanistan is remote -- yet omar al-bashir and uhuru kenyatta have both been indicted as sitting leaders .
Argumentative	 the icc will only prosecute if those who have committed war crimes are not going to be prosecuted locally but this is as much the case for western leaders as african ones .
Argumentative	 this points clearly to the icc proselytizing what is ` right ' and ` wrong ' to africans but not to other leaders -- treating these leaders less respectfully and blatantly undermining african nations sovereignty in a way they would not , or would dare not , for others .
Argumentative	 the icc can only investigate situations that are referred to it by either the host country , or the security council .
Argumentative	 a power also exists for the prosecutor to seek investigation , though this has as yet only been used twice .
Argumentative	 as such , most atrocities that occur across the world are shielded from prosecution because such a prosecution would be against the interests of a member security council .
Argumentative	 leaders do not seem to be brought for investigation until they offend the west ; charles taylor was not prosecuted until he had a falling out with the usa , despite their soft support for him in overthrowing the doe regime .
Argumentative	 another case in point is uganda where the lord 's resistance army has been charged , but not the pro-us government forces , despite evidence existing they have also committed crimes .
Argumentative	 it is clear then that the icc makes decisions by broad external factors , which biases it against africa which does not have any countries on the unsc or any patrons sitting on the council .
