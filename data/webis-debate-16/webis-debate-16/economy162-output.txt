Non-Argumentative	the world bank (2012) have provided data indicating, globally, 75% of the world’s poor are ‘unbanked’ - meaning 75% of the world’s poor do not have access to a bank account.
Non-Argumentative	 in sub-saharan africa the figure is 76% of adults (care, 2014).
Non-Argumentative	 the focus on banking has taken two key directions.
Non-Argumentative	 on the one hand, a focus has been placed on understanding the geography of the unbanked - who is unbanked, where, and why.
Non-Argumentative	 the multiple factors affecting access to banking have been identified.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, barriers identified by the world bank include poverty, inaccessibility to banks, and a banking supply issue.
Non-Argumentative	 on another hand, concern with a lack of banking has focused on the opportunities that being ‘banked’ creates.
Non-Argumentative	 whether the concern is on land, empowerment, and entrepreneurialism, banking has been identified as a means for poverty alleviation.
Non-Argumentative	 although the evidence remains open to debate.
Non-Argumentative	microfinance is one model used to enable the unbanked to access financial services - referring to the provision of money, credit, insurance, and savings.
Non-Argumentative	 microfinance is structured around the community and providing an alternative system to distribute loans.
Non-Argumentative	 the social policy model is based on the idea that access to small loans funding will make a difference to the everyday lives of the poor.
Non-Argumentative	 small loans should be provided into the community, which is able to organise and distribute loans, and through trust ensure flexible repayment schemes.
Non-Argumentative	 the model is argued to be responsive to the needs of women.
Non-Argumentative	microfinance schemes have been rolled out across africa - integrating informal, traditional finance groups with modern updates.
Non-Argumentative	 however, this debate looks at the evidence of whether microfinance schemes in africa are beneficial.
Non-Argumentative	 how has the geography of money - in terms of savings, spending and future investment - changed through microfinance?
Non-Argumentative	 what opportunities are emerging for those given access to microfinance?
Non-Argumentative	 is the organisation of microfinance working in the african context?
Non-Argumentative	 fundamentally, is providing finance to the ‘unbanked’ an effective solution to poverty?
Argumentative	 the livelihoods approach provides a useful model to understand how poor people live ; and remains important to recognising the benefits of microfinance .
Argumentative	 the provision of microfinance reduces vulnerability to shocks and changes such as losing a job ; enhances people 's access to assets that they use and need , such as finance , friend networks , and land , ; and this fundamentally acts to change the lives of the poor .
Argumentative	 microfinance provides social protection through tapping into social capital .

Argumentative	 microfinance is empowering the communities that are using it - showing in development , small is beautiful .
Argumentative	 communities are empowered to change their conditions .
Argumentative	 for example taking the case of savings - microfinance allows for savings .
Argumentative	 half of the adults that saved in sub-saharan africa , during, used an informal , community-based approach , care  .
Argumentative	 first , having savings reduces household risk .
Argumentative	 care is one of many organisations working in innovations for microfinance .

Argumentative	 savings is security in livelihoods .
Argumentative	 second , microfinance is providing key skills .
Argumentative	 oxfam 's savings for change initiative provides training on savings , and lending , to women in communities in senegal and mali .
Argumentative	 evidence from mali indicates startup capital provided has ensured better food security , women 's empowerment in the financial decision-making of households , and crucially , a sense of community bond among the women , oxfam  .
Argumentative	 gender based violence within households may also be reduced .
Argumentative	 introducing finance provides communities with access to startup capital .
Argumentative	 access to financial capital is vital in several respects for initiating capitalism .
Argumentative	 firstly , access to capital enables entrepreneurialism .
Argumentative	 the poor have business ideas that would benefit both themselves and their community they just require access to capital to invest in such ideas .
Argumentative	 the initiative ` lend with care ' is providing access to capital to empower entrepreneurs .
Argumentative	 secondly , the cumulative effect of small-scale savings and borrowing , enabled through microfinance enables individuals , families and communities , to enter markets - of land and property .
Argumentative	 being able to buy property and land can enable personal security , dignity , and increasing returns .

Argumentative	 microfinance is providing rural communities a chance to gain food security and reduce vulnerability to risks such as climate change , unstable demand , and political tensions .
Argumentative	 microfinance supports small scale agriculture -- which is more sustainable , effective for growth , and beneficial for communities than larger scale agriculture .
Argumentative	 in zimbabwe , small scale farming has the capability to improve production , benefiting households , communities , and the nation , irin ,; morrison  .
Argumentative	 kiva , a microfinance ngo , is providing affordable capital to remote communities .
Argumentative	 loans have been provided to small-scale farmers and a rental system has been set-up enabling farmers to borrow tools and resources needed .
Argumentative	 access to a small loan provides benefits for the poor 's ability to access high quality health care .
Argumentative	 a lack of access to banking facilities - loans and credit - may mean the poor are left excluded from health care services as these are usually not free .
Argumentative	 microfinance institutions accept the irregularities of the poor 's income , so enabling health care to be affordable to the poor by providing access to finance .
Argumentative	 as ofori-adjei  shows the integration of microfinance institutions within healthcare systems in ghana is required to resolve the issue of inaccessibility .
Argumentative	 ill health should not put a household into a state of poverty - microfinance provides this protection .
Argumentative	 microfinance schemes not only provide loans to access health care but are now integrating non-financial services , such as health education , within their finance schemes .
