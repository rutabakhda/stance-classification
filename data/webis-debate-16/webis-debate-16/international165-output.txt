Non-Argumentative	africa has abundant natural resources.
Non-Argumentative	 from diamond and timber to oil, the continent has a large concentration of mineral wealth which has turned africa in to a major exporter of these goods.
Non-Argumentative	 there arecountries in africa which are termed as resource rich, where oils and minerals count for over 20% of gdp.
Non-Argumentative	 these resources were a primary reason for the involvement of western powers on the continent, which soon resulted in the scramble for africa.
Non-Argumentative	since decolonisation the west has continued its extraction of africa’s resources, with other countries such as china involving themselves more recently.
Non-Argumentative	 since decolonisation there has been a higher prominence of transnational companies (tncs) over state actors.
Non-Argumentative	 these tncs extract the mineral wealth and export these resources to the rest of the world.
Non-Argumentative	 despite the trade of resources from the continent, africa has arguably not benefitted.
Non-Argumentative	 this disparity between natural resources and economic development led jeffery sachs and andrew warner to the claim that there is a resources curse where, despite trade, africa has seen little development.
Non-Argumentative	 resources however are not destiny.
Non-Argumentative	 there is the possibility to benefit from mineral wealth, through better management of resources and greater transparency, mean that the presence of natural resource is positive.
Argumentative	 corruption in african governance is a common feature of african governance , with resources being a major source of exploitation by the political class .
Argumentative	 natural resources are often controlled by the government .
Argumentative	 as resources fund the government 's actions rather than tax , there is a decrease in accountability to the citizenry which enables the government to abuse its ownership of this land to make profit .
Argumentative	 to benefit from resource wealth , money from the exploitation of mineral wealth and other sources needs to be reinvested in to the country 's economy and human capital .
Argumentative	 investing in infrastructure and education can encourage long term growth .
Argumentative	 however a large amount of funds are pocketed by politicians and bureaucrats instead , hindering growth .
Argumentative	 africa progress panel , app , conducted a survey on five mining deals betweenandin the democratic republic of congo , drc .
Argumentative	 they found that the drc was selling off state-owned mining companies at low prices .
Argumentative	 the new offshore owner would then resell the companies for much more , with much of the profit finding its way to drc government officials .
Argumentative	 the profits were twice as high as the combined budget for education and health , demonstrating that corruption caused by resource exploitation detracts from any long term growth .
Argumentative	 both licit and illicit resource extraction have caused ecological and environmental damage in africa .
Argumentative	 the procurement of many natural resources requires processes such as mining and deforestation , which are harmful to the environment .
Argumentative	 deforestation for access purposes , timber and cattle has led to around 3.4 million hectares of woodland being destroyed betweenandand , in turn , soil degradation .
Argumentative	 as africa 's rainforest are necessary for global ecological systems , this is a significant loss .
Argumentative	 mining and transportation also create damage through pollution and the scarring of the landscape .
Argumentative	 mining produces various harmful chemicals which contaminate water and soil , a process which is worsened by illicit groups who cut corners to ensure higher profits .
Argumentative	 the majority of investment in africa by trans national companies , tncs , goes towards resource extraction .
Argumentative	 many companies use transfer pricing , tax avoidance and anonymous company ownership to increase profits at the expense of resource abundant nations .

Argumentative	 kofi annan , former united nations security general , has claimed that africa 's outflow of funds by tncs in the extractive industries is twice as high as inflows to the continent .
Argumentative	 businesses such as barclays have been criticised for their promotion of tax havens in africa .
Argumentative	 these allow tncs to avoid government taxation for projects such as resource extraction , a symptom of the attitude of foreign companies to investment in africa .
Argumentative	 the unfavourable inflow/outflow balance prevents reinvestment in africa 's infrastructure , education and health services .
Argumentative	 there is a strong connection between the presence of natural resources and conflict within africa .
Argumentative	 natural resources , especially those with a high commodity price such as diamonds , are a useful means of funding rebellions and governments .
Argumentative	 thecivil war in sierra leone became infamous for the blood diamonds which came from mines with forced slavery .
Argumentative	 these diamonds were used to fund the revolutionary united front , ruf , for eleven years , extending the blood-shed .
Argumentative	 continued conflict in the congo is also attributed to the control of mineral wealth and exemplifies how resources have negatively impacted africa .
