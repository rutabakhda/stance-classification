Non-Argumentative	a hate crime is a crime, usually violent, motivated by prejudice or intolerance toward a member of a gender, racial, religious, or social group.
Non-Argumentative	 in this resolution, hate crime "enhancements" refer to a court’s power to impose a heavier sentence on an offender if it is shown that his crime was motivated by racial hatred or other prejudices.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, normal graffiti would not be punished severely, but if a swastika was sprayed onto a jewish temple, there is clear racial motive behind the crime and it would attract a much more severe sentence.
Non-Argumentative	 this pertains to all other aspects of crime, i.e. a lynching would be punished much more severely than a regular homicide.
Non-Argumentative	 most western liberal democracies' justice systems recognize hate crimes and punish them more severely.
Argumentative	 hate crime enhancements are unjust because they respond to two equal results , i.e. assault vs. racial mugging , with different punishments .
Argumentative	 we need to judge solely on the concrete actions of the aggressor in order to prevent punishments from being based on arbitrary judgements as to an offender 's `` intent '' , which can be very difficult to prove .
Argumentative	 otherwise `` intent '' may be supposed or argued in cases where it did not exist , leading to perverse sentencing whereby a crime is punished more harshly despite the true absence of intent .
Argumentative	 there is a danger of unjustly branding someone as bigoted and punishing them excessively , e.g. for their involvement in a bar fight where the victim coincidentally belonged to a minority group .
Argumentative	 juries might also be willing to make the logical leap that , because the aggressor was proved to hold bigoted views in general towards his victim 's ethnic group , these views must have motivated his actions in this individual incident , despite the absence of any evidence linking the specific brawl in a bar to the aggressor 's views .
Argumentative	 therefore it is unjust to punish two crimes with equal effects differently on the highly subjective basis of `` intent '' , and thus hate crime enhancements are unjust .
Argumentative	 hate crimes are crimes that are based on an idea that the perpetrator had prior to the crime .
Argumentative	 the crime itself is no different from any other crime except that it is punished more harshly .
Argumentative	 why is this so ?
Argumentative	 because we are punishing an idea .
Argumentative	 all forms of violent crime , whether they are murders , rapes , or beatings are an expression of hatred toward another human being .
Argumentative	 to add more punishment to a crime because it represents a particular kind of hate , an idea , is to unfairly distinguish between different violent acts and trivialize those violent acts that do not appear to be motivated by prejudice hate .
Argumentative	 this is unjust because the idea itself does not cause harm , and is in fact legal in most cases , with the exception of direct incitement to violence , as racist or prejudiced statements and ideas are not illegal in most western liberal democracies .
Argumentative	 we allow extreme and prejudiced ideas to be legal because we recognise the value of free speech and open discourse in debating and discussing ideas , so as to best allow for progress in human thought .
Argumentative	 hate crime enhancements constitute an attack on this as they make an individual liable for harsher punishments for his actions if he holds certain views , and thus the law unfairly discriminates against these particular viewpoints and not against others , and so hate crime enhancements are unjust .
Argumentative	 by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another , rather than as being committed by individuals against their society , the labelling of crimes as `` hate crimes '' causes groups to feel persecuted by one another , and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime .
Argumentative	  these effects spread beyond the hate crimes themselves .
Argumentative	 by prosecuting high-profile cases of white hate crimes against blacks , for example , it encourages blacks to see themselves as part of a distinct community different from the white community and whose relations are marked by crimes committed by one against the other .
Argumentative	 this is especially true when one community seems to perpetrate more hate crime , or at least more convictions thereof are secured , against another community than visa-versa .
Argumentative	 an analysis of hate crime date from the usa examining how hate crimes against whites are viewed with respect to hate crimes against blacks has hypothesised that the prevailing view in the minds of the public is that the crime that whites are most likely to commit against blacks is a hate crime , and that it is hard for most americans to envision a white person committing a crime against a black person for a different reason .
Argumentative	 the only white people who commit crimes against black people , goes the public belief , are racially prejudiced white extremists , and in contrast the very idea of hate crimes committed against whites is met with scepticism and disbelief .
Argumentative	  there have been several high-profile cases in the usa where some individuals have argued actual hate crimes against whites were not treated as such as a consequence of such public disbelief .
Argumentative	  this can lead to an unjust situation where hate crime enhancements are , or are perceived as being , only applied `` against '' one community by another , despite hate crimes actually being committed by individuals within both communities against other individuals .
Argumentative	 therefore hate crime enhancements are unjust .
