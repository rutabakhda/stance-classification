Non-Argumentative	syria, a relatively small but pivotal middle eastern country, has been on a downward spiral since marchwhen there were peaceful street protests calling for the president, bashar al assad, to step down.
Non-Argumentative	 assad responded with force, firing on the protestors in daara on 21st march, and within a week demonstrations and some clashes in six of the twelve provincial capitals.
Non-Argumentative	 quelling daara with force was followed in late april with violent clashes in homs which in turn escalated nationwide on aprilwhen more thandemonstrators were killed across the country.
Non-Argumentative	 some among the protestors responded to force with force and formed the free syrian army at the end of july whose organisation was enhanced by defections from the syrian army.
Non-Argumentative	 peace attempts have failed and the country is now involved in a full scale civil war between rebel groups, that want to overthrow the government as inspired by the other arab spring revolutions, and assad's government.
Non-Argumentative	 the civil war is compounded by the fault lines that run through syria's history, the government is supported by a shi'ite sect called the alawites, that have historically been a persecuted minority but under bashar's father, hafez who was president fromto 2000, they rose to prominence.
Non-Argumentative	 sunnis, the majority, want to return to political dominance, but these are not the only two groups, there are also christians and kurds who both have reason to fear a sunni return too dominance and worry there will be no place for them in a post-assad syria.
Non-Argumentative	the european union imposed sanctions from 10th maywith further restrictions inpreventing any export of arms to syria.
Non-Argumentative	 yet both sides have been armed; the assad by russia and syria, and the rebels by saudi arabia and qatar.
Non-Argumentative	 western states, unlike in libya, have so far been unwilling to take any action.
Non-Argumentative	 however in march 2013, two years after the start of the conflict, david cameron, prime minister of the united kingdom, and francois hollande, president of france urged the european union to lift its arms embargo but the rest of europe was unmoved.
Non-Argumentative	 the obama administration has so far also been unwilling to take any steps beyond the diplomatic; the white house has overruled a plan to arm moderate groups of the free syrian army that was backed by much of the washington foreign policy and security establishment including secretary of state hillary clinton, secretary of defence leon panetta, chairman of the joint chiefs martin dempsey, and cia director david patraeus.
Non-Argumentative	 should obama have gone along with the establishment’s plan?
Argumentative	 the assad regime has clearly lost its legitimacy and has precipitated a humanitarian crisis in syria .
Argumentative	 the february estimate ofkilled is up from an estimate ofonly a month before , so clearly the violence is escalating .
Argumentative	 the conflict is also affecting neighbours ; refugees have flooded into jordan , lebanon , and turkey , and israel is already believed to have attacked a convoy or research facility involved in chemical and biological weapons development .
Argumentative	 clearly the presence of these weapons show how much worse the situation could get if assad is not overthrown .
Argumentative	 not intervening risks the whole region being slowly destabilised and drawn in to the conflict .
Argumentative	 democracies should support moderate groups seeking to oust dictators because the result will hopefully be a moderate , democratic state .
Argumentative	 this would then be a reliable partner for the future that would be more willing to help engage and resolve the region 's problems .
Argumentative	 but this is not all about being high minded and wanting to promote democracy in the middle east , arms need to be provided in order to ensure future influence in syria .
Argumentative	 we already know that there are jihadis operating in syria so it is plain that this is a conflict that will eventually have wider implications for the west .
Argumentative	 if we want to have influence in syria after assad is overthrown then we need to begin helping opposition groups .
Argumentative	 it is in our interest to build up the moderate groups so as to deny support to the extremists ; once this is over we would be in a much better position if we have grateful friends on the ground rather than groups who are resentful that we provided fine words but no real help .
Argumentative	 we do n't want to find ourselves having to root out terrorists from the air using uavs .
Argumentative	 the syrian army is one of the biggest armies in the world ; it is nothing like the poorly equipped libyan army that was beaten by western backed rebels in.
Argumentative	 the government has aircraft , and helicopters that are used to bomb the rebels , and heavy russian built tanks that are impervious to most of the small arms the free syrian army has .
Argumentative	 providing arms would quickly even the odds ; light anti-tank weapons would be effective against syrian armoured vehicles repeating the success with which hezbollah employed them when they knocked out sixty israeli armoured vehicles in, while man portable air defence systems would quickly make the skies too dangerous for the syrian airforce so protecting free syrian controlled areas from the threat of attack from the air .
Argumentative	 syria 's government has been receiving outside support from a variety of sources ; russia and iran being the most prominent .
Argumentative	 iran has been training the jaysh al - shabi , a syrian government-controlled force modelled on iran 's basij militia .
Argumentative	 far from just providing weapons , both iran and hezbollah from lebanon have been sending fighters to support the syrian government .
Argumentative	 the rebels have received some support for qatar and saudi arabia but not to the extent the syrian government has .
Argumentative	 anyone with an interest in the free syrian cause should realise that they can not do so simply by sitting on their hands expecting a victory when those doing the fighting are only provided diplomatic support .
Argumentative	 the best solution would be a ceasefire between the two sides in the syrian civil war and a negotiated settlement , but it is clear we are long past the point where this approach stood a chance of success .
Argumentative	 the united nations peace effort under kofi annan failed in the middle of last year and there has been no progress since .
Argumentative	 similarly all attempts to bring pressure to bear throughout the security council have failed as a result of russia supporting assad 's regime .
Argumentative	 this leaves the unilateral initiatives to help the rebels .
Argumentative	 no state wants full intervention as france did in mali so the only alternative is simply to help the free syrian army .
Argumentative	 to do so means providing what they need to win the conflict ; primarily arms that can defeat the syrian army .
Argumentative	 this need not be considered to be exclusive with diplomacy ; the intervening state should continue to try to find a diplomatic solution just as before the dayton accords nato helped the croats militarily while at the same time looking to diplomacy to provide an overall solution to the conflict .
