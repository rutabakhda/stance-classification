Non-Argumentative	on saturday 5th may the french and greeks went to the polls and both countries voted against austerity.
Non-Argumentative	 in france president sarkozy became the 11th european leader to loose office largely as a result of the european financial crisis being replaced by francois hollande, a socialist, who campaigned on a promise of growth and less austerity.
Non-Argumentative	the european economy is in crisis, the economies of many member states have been flat lining or even declining since the financial crisis of 2008.
Non-Argumentative	 the smaller countries around europe’s periphery in particular have faced steep declines in their economies.
Non-Argumentative	 ireland’s economy declined by 6.7% betweenandwhile greece’s has fallen by 16%.
Non-Argumentative	 what started as a financial crisis or a housing bubble has become a debt crisis as governments tried to spend their way out of recession they built up large debts, so large in the case of some countries that they have had to have bail outs.
Non-Argumentative	 other european countries only agreed to provide money for these bail outs on the condition of the countries being rescued impose austerity to reduce their expenditures to provide confidence that they will be able to pay back their debts.
Non-Argumentative	 on 2nd marcheuropean leaders with the exception of the uk and czech republic signed the fiscal compact which committed its signatories to a structural deficit (meaning it allows for deficits for investments like infrastructure that will pay off in the future) not exceeding 0.5% of gdp and to reducing government debt down to 60% of gdp.
Non-Argumentative	 austerity however is not popular and the results of the recent elections are threatening this treaty and its ambitious goals.
Non-Argumentative	 this discusses whether europe needs to stick to stringent austerity measures such as those that will be needed to meet the compact or should states put the social support of their citizens first.
Non-Argumentative	some terms used in this debateausterity: during the recent crisis has come to mean an economic policy of cutting the deficit and debt through cutting spending.
Non-Argumentative	 this often inevitably means reducing benefits.
Non-Argumentative	demand: the amount people are willing to buy of goods and services at a given price.
Non-Argumentative	 in the whole economy this means the combined amount of goods and services the whole population wants to buy.
Non-Argumentative	social support: in this debate we are taking this to mean support provided by the state to society and individuals.
Non-Argumentative	welfare state: the responsibility of the state for the social and economic wellbeing of its citizens usually in the case of health care, education, employment and social security.
Argumentative	 we all have a duty to provide aid to those who need it and the government is the best placed to act on this duty .
Argumentative	 we all need a place to live , a level of healthcare and some income in order to survive .
Argumentative	 the idea behind the welfare state is to provide for this through creating a safety net for every citizen .
Argumentative	 the state is responsible for the social and economic wellbeing of it citizens .
Argumentative	 it does this by , for example , provision of social housing -- either at greatly reduced rates or free of charge , through state hospitals , through unemployment benefit for those made unemployed and disability benefits for those who ca n't work .
Argumentative	 with austerity the government is doing exactly the opposite of what it should be doing to help its citizens .
Argumentative	 just at a time when more people need these payments they are being cut back .
Argumentative	 to make matters worse an increase in vat has been a favored method of increasing government income while there has been a squeeze on unemployment benefits as the government does not want to pay more as unemployment rises ; in greece in the year to decemberthe number of unemployed workers was up 45.1 % whereas the number of unemployment benefit recipients went up only 9.6 % .
Argumentative	 as a result the whole package of austerity measures is usually regressive , with its impact falling harder on the poor than the rich , as has been the case in greece .
Argumentative	 austerity leads to a cycle of decline that continues on down until the state has been stripped down to the bare bones .
Argumentative	 we are seeing this in countries where the european union has enforced austerity as a condition for bailouts , particularly greece .
Argumentative	 government austerity reduces demand as the government is spending less .
Argumentative	 with less demand the economy is damaged and a smaller tax take comes in for the government leading to even greater austerity if the government is to balance its books .
Argumentative	 austerity therefore creates a vicious cycle when there is no extra demand from the private sector to cushion the blow .
Argumentative	 even standard & poor 's previously a champion of austerity in its justification for downgrading the credit rating of eurozone governments said `` austerity alone risks becoming self-defeating , as domestic demand falls in line with consumers ' rising concerns about job security and disposable incomes , eroding national tax revenues . ''
Argumentative	 the answer is therefore less austerity , more support for the economy and more social support for the citizens .
Argumentative	 if people are less concerned for the future as a result of knowing there will be government support if they are made unemployed they will be more willing to spend rather than save when they are employed so helping the economy to recover .
Argumentative	 recessions are caused by too little demand in the economy so austerity in a time of recession is exactly the opposite of what the government should be doing as it means further reductions in the amount of demand in the economy .
Argumentative	 governments should take an activist approach to try to stabilise the economic cycle , the swinging from boom to bust to boom that characterises the economy , or at least reduce the depths of the recessions and temper the booms .
Argumentative	 this means that governments should spend less when the economy is booming and , crucially , more when the economy is in recession so as to stabilise the economy .
Argumentative	 it should be remembered that government spending does not just affect the public sector there is a multiplier effect on the economy , spending on building a road not only means construction companies get business but so do their suppliers and their workers spend their new wages in shops .
Argumentative	 economists working for president obama at the time of the u.s. stimulus believed that for every$ spent by the government there would be 1.6 $ benefit to the economy .
Argumentative	 the current course of austerity on top of austerity risks creating a lost generation of youth across europe .
Argumentative	 unemployment is high everywhere in europe but it is particularly pronounced among young people .
Argumentative	 in the eurozone the average youth , under 25s , unemployment rate is 21.6 % while in spain and greece it is more than% .
Argumentative	 such staggeringly high unemployment rates will have immense consequences as a whole generation is demoralised .
Argumentative	 even when the economy recovers this lost generation may not be able to get a job as new school leavers and graduates will get the jobs in preference to those who have been unemployed for long periods .
Argumentative	 there needs to be more money , not less , for education and retraining for the sectors of the economy where there are jobs , such as it specialists .
Argumentative	 this means more investment not just in adult education but more money being spent on creating jobs , whether permanent , placements or internships , specifically to give young people experience in work .
Argumentative	 the european commission recognises the problem and is providing $million for placements around europe , member governments must do the same .
