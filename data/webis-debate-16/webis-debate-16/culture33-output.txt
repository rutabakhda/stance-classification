Non-Argumentative	the creative arts might be considered to include painting and sculpture but also drama, poetry and creative writing, dance, composition and music, and others.
Non-Argumentative	 this will not focus on literature and other disciplines, such as history of art, where the main role is to analyze the creative output of others.
Non-Argumentative	 instead the focus here is on those degrees that seek to train students to be practitioners of those disciplines rather than generalists with a focus on discussing them.
Non-Argumentative	there are two possible approaches to this debate (in fact there are many but two are the most obvious).
Non-Argumentative	 the first – and the one most clearly in the spirit of the motion – is that the creative arts add little to the economy directly and that if society is going to have universities, especially in those countries where they are funded through direct taxation, then students should be focusing on subjects that have a proven economic worth.
Non-Argumentative	 although the arts do contribute financially to an economy, it tends not to be in the way that, say, languages, engineering or economics do.
Non-Argumentative	 there is another aspect here, which leads into the second interpretation, that graduates of creative arts departments rarely make their living in that field; the competition is simply too fierce.
Non-Argumentative	that brings us on to prop’s second choice for a definition, which is that if people really want to learn the creative arts then a university setting is not the right place to do so.
Non-Argumentative	 stage schools and fine art colleges are often separate from universities and, even then, some argue that if someone has real talent, they should just get on with it.
Non-Argumentative	 there are countless examples of people who have excelled in the arts who have no formal training and learnt their craft ‘on the job’.
Non-Argumentative	the specific focus on the creative arts also poses some problems for proposition.
Non-Argumentative	 if drama has to go, then why not philosophy – or for that matter large chunks of physics?
Non-Argumentative	 very few graduates pursue their subject professionally and those who do tend to simply teach it to the next generation replicating the situation.
Non-Argumentative	 as a result, if opposition accepts that, say, history has a place on the curriculum, because it is a useful way of training people’s minds, then why not train them as poets or ballerinas?
Non-Argumentative	opposition has some strong arguments on this front – the arts directly generate more revenue than, say, english literature.
Non-Argumentative	 many graduates go on to do jobs that don’t require any degree at all, let alone their particular degree – so, once again, why focus on this particular collection of degrees.
Non-Argumentative	 opp’s strongest argument, however, is that society is about far more than cold economic data and that the arts add hugely to society in a way that is difficult to measure but would certainly be missed.
Non-Argumentative	this then opens up two lines of attack.
Non-Argumentative	 the first is that the university experience is, in and of itself, a net social benefit.
Non-Argumentative	 latterly, it also raises the issue that having members of a society with certain skills enriches it even if those graduates never use the skills they have acquired professionally in later life.
Non-Argumentative	debater’s note:this can be an interesting way of looking at what role higher education actually fulfills and what taxes are for in the relationship between economic benefit and the wider social health of a nation.
Non-Argumentative	 a truly minimalist approach would only leave us with what are sometime called the old professions – medicine, law, engineering, teaching and academia.
Non-Argumentative	 traditionally there would have been another slot on that list for the priesthood.
Non-Argumentative	 that niche is probably now taken by it.
Non-Argumentative	 however, it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate into an exchange about whether arts or science degrees are ‘harder’ by some objective standard.
Non-Argumentative	 that’s really not the focus of this motion (and it’s rubbish as well) and, tempting though that particular intellectual cul-de-sac might be, it’s best avoided.
Non-Argumentative	for the purposes of these notes it is assumed that society is making some collective expenditure on the provision of degrees.
Non-Argumentative	 although in some countries this may not be explicit as the students incur the costs of their degree either up front or at a subsequent date, there is still an opportunity cost in terms of work that person could have been doing if they were not engaged in their studies.
Argumentative	 in those countries where the full costs of a degree are borne upfront by the students’ parents, the proposition may like to point out that parents are rarely wild about the idea that their child wishes to study poetry or dance as they do not believe that the expenditure will ever be recouped in income.
Argumentative	the median earning figure across arts degrees is , itself deceptive .
Argumentative	 the median in the us is $ 45,000 but this disguises the lower end of the scale , with% earning $ 30,000 a year or less .
Argumentative	 unlike education and social work which at least tend to have the consistency of a government salary , the arts are also fantastically unreliable as an employment sector .
Argumentative	 teachers and social workers may have comparatively low salaries but at least they can be assured of job security .
Argumentative	 the arts offers low and unstable wages , frequently at an ongoing expense to the taxpayer , when the jobs exist at all .
Argumentative	 as a result , encouraging the creative arts through university qualifications places both an initial and , potentially , ongoing cost on the rest of society .
Argumentative	 it also means that graduates are likely to be destined to long term financial instability because of a decision they made as a teenager .
Argumentative	 it is difficult to see who benefits from such an arrangement .
Argumentative	 the idea that the best place to learn an artform is a classroom is fantastically modern .
Argumentative	 the idea of teaching them at all is fairly recent .
Argumentative	 if ever there were an example of ` those who can , do ; those who ca n't , teach ' , then it 's the arts .
Argumentative	 novelists , poets , painters , dancers , composers , musicians and others have been learning from each other as they practiced their art for , quite literally , millennia .
Argumentative	 universities have to provide a range of courses , some of which are going to be more financially viable than others , that fine .
Argumentative	 however , investment in one area inevitably means that there are resources not being focused elsewhere .
Argumentative	 it 's not a huge factor but some subjects -- creative arts , theology and a few others do represent a ` back door ' into universities for those who did n't get the grades to get onto more demanding courses .
Argumentative	 those students still need to sleep , study and socialize somewhere -- in place of those who could have taken their places on engineering , medicine , economics or similar courses had the space been available .
Argumentative	 by keeping these courses , universities are turning away students for other disciplines and those studying the arts courses are learning in a way that may not be the most productive -- as mentioned in the previous argument .
Argumentative	 it 's difficult to see who wins .
