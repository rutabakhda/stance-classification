Non-Argumentative	the precautionary principle has no universally accepted definition, therio declaration on environment and development defined it as 'where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.'
Non-Argumentative	  shale gas is a term used to describe natural gas trapped as hydrocarbons within saturated rock formations, especially the sedimentary rock shale.
Non-Argumentative	 although quite widespread, until the past decade or so shale gas has not been much exploited as an energy source as it cannot be extracted easily and cheaply by traditional drilling techniques.
Non-Argumentative	 in recent years this has changed as higher energy prices have made investment in shale gas fields more worthwhile, and improved extraction techniques have meant that unconventional sources of energy can now be exploited more easily.
Non-Argumentative	 the main process involved in extracting shale gas is hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”), where a fluid is forced down a well to create a build-up of pressure in the rock below, forcing it to break up and allowing the gas contained within it to be recovered to the surface.
Non-Argumentative	shale gas formations can be found across much of the eastern and central parts of north america.
Non-Argumentative	 exploitation first took off in 2000; the number of wells in the barnett shales of texas grew from less thanto overin the eight years to 2008.
Non-Argumentative	 other deposits being exploited include the marcellus shales of new york and adjacent states, and the haynesville shales in louisiana and texas.
Non-Argumentative	 there is now interest in exploiting similar deposits across the border in quebec, as well as in poland and the uk within europe.
Non-Argumentative	proponents of shale gas argue that it can provide a vast new source of reliable and economical energy, as well as helping industrial economies move towards a lower-carbon future.
Non-Argumentative	 but sceptics doubt the economic viability of the sector, question its environmental impact, and raise serious safety concerns.
Non-Argumentative	 these voices are becoming increasingly influential in the usa, and are attempting to block the exploitation of shale gas in canada and europe.
Argumentative	 the residents of areas where shale gas is found and drilling may occur have a right to maintain their health , something which drilling may affect .
Argumentative	 dangerous chemicals are pumped into rock formations that are also the source of groundwater for millions of people .
Argumentative	 ina hydrologist found benzene in a water well in wyoming above where fracking was occurring .
Argumentative	 dramatic film of inflammable gas leaking through drinking water pipes underlines the risks posed by this uncontrolled experiment under our homes .
Argumentative	 companies are in denial over these dangers , but their refusal to come clean about exactly what chemicals they are using is hardly reassuring .
Argumentative	 while there is a chance that lives are at risk , either from water contamination or from gas explosions as a result of the fracking such risky methods of extracting natural gas should be banned .
Argumentative	 given that some of the negative consequences from hydraulic fracturing processes may take many years to emerge , the precautionary principle should be applied .
Argumentative	 applying the precautionary principle would mean changing the burden of proof from environmentalists having to prove that fracking does cause harm in each circumstance to it being the oil and gas firms who have to prove that fracking is safe .
Argumentative	 as a result fracking should be stopped all together or at the very least greatly reducing the amount of fracking leaving only a few fields in operation so that the effects of the process can be studied and as a result sufficient legislation but in place to regulate the industry .
Argumentative	 until it can be prove these methods are entirely safe , hydraulic fracturing should be stopped and the shale gas industry denied further drilling permits .
Argumentative	 expanding shale gas extraction would be very damaging to the environment as the process requires a large number of small wells to be drilled in each gas field , ohio for example has 80,000 fracked wells , by comparison only 10,000 have been drilled in the uk part of the north sea since.
Argumentative	 this means beautiful rural areas will be spoiled by the presence of many gas rigs , each with its accompanying pipes , buildings , tracks , etc, agricultural and amenity land will be lost and wildlife disturbed .
Argumentative	 and heavy construction traffic will ruin roads and create noise pollution for nearby residents .
Argumentative	 climate change is the biggest problem facing our planet and it requires urgent action for us to shift to a low-carbon economy .
Argumentative	 shale gas is simply another fossil fuel , releasing carbon into the atmosphere when it is burnt to provide power .
Argumentative	 as the tyndall centre warns `` while it is possible that shale gas could substitute for coal , within the uk , this would likely be counteracted by global use of coal and shale gas . ''
Argumentative	 so rather than replacing even dirtier coal as a source of power , it is likely simply to augment it , feeding our wasteful society 's insatiable appetite for energy .
Argumentative	 indeed , if shale gas lowers the price of fossil fuels , it may contribute further to the problem by encouraging a continued rise in energy consumption .
Argumentative	 worse , by taking investment from renewable energy sources such as solar , tidal and wind energy , shale gas may postpone the necessary shift to a low-carbon economy .
