Non-Argumentative	a voucher system is one in which, instead of tax revenues being distributed directly to state-managed schools, parents are issued with vouchers that can be spent on education in any school, whether it is managed by the state or not.
Non-Argumentative	 schools therefore compete for pupils and the funds that come with them.
Non-Argumentative	such a scheme was originally put forward by milton friedman in the 1950s and now systems of voucher funding are in place in several american states and european municipalities.
Non-Argumentative	 the idea was also briefly the basis for a reform of uk nursery funding.
Argumentative	Â state education in some areas of the uk is continuing to fail , despite increased investment .
Argumentative	 this will allow those pupils who are currently locked into sub-standard state education access to the private schools enjoyed by their more privileged peers , because you can spend the vouchers anywhere .
Argumentative	 even if private school fees can only be subsidised by the voucher scheme , most private schools are charitable organisations that do not run a profit , and so in the vast majority of circumstances the voucher will make private schools accessible to poorer families .
Argumentative	 state schools will , like the private schools , have to offer a high quality service in order that parents do not take their children elsewhere .
Argumentative	 this incentivises in particular high level management , who , if the school fails , will be out of a job with a blot on their record .
Argumentative	 different parents have different values and priorities , and it is entirely legitimate for them to wish to pass these on to their children .
Argumentative	 the state does not know any better than them with which values the ideal life can be lived .
Argumentative	 further , children are individuals who respond in very different ways to different styles of teaching .
Argumentative	 parents know their children better than central government possibly could , and so are the best placed to decide what sort of school their child should go to .
Argumentative	 currently , there is very little state provision for non-mainstream styles of learning , whereas in the private sector there is a big incentive for educational innovation .
