Non-Argumentative	reformers argue that the school calendar used in countries round the world is outdated and inefficient.
Non-Argumentative	 the current system, which usually consists of two or three school terms punctuated by long holiday periods, stands accused of doing little to equip schoolchildren for later life, wasting time repeating material after long vacations in which much of the previous year’s lessons have been forgotten, and using school resources inefficiently.
Non-Argumentative	much better, they say, to introduce year-round schooling, in which shorter blocks of learning time are interspersed with more frequent but brief holidays (for exampledays of school followed bydays of holiday).
Non-Argumentative	 however, others say that the present timetable is fine, and that any change will just cause needless upheaval without dealing with the true reasons for educational underachievement.
Non-Argumentative	so should countries move to year-round schooling?
Argumentative	 studies show that students in year-round schooling tend to get perform better on many assessment metrics than those who do not .
Argumentative	 schools operating a year-round calendar do not have to cram so much course content into amonth schedule , but can space out learning better .
Argumentative	 this allows teaching to proceed at a more logical pace , helping students learn better .
Argumentative	 furthermore , by giving students frequent short breaks , instead of two or three long ones , pupils are refreshed and ready to learn when school resumes .
Argumentative	 during long summer holidays , students completely put aside learning and forget all about their studies for up to three months .
Argumentative	 in this time , they inevitably forget quite a lot of what they have learned .
Argumentative	 teachers then have to spend the first weeks of the new academic year bringing them back up to speed .
Argumentative	 by eliminating the long summer break and replacing it with year-round learning punctuated by shorter vacation times , this problem would be much reduced .
Argumentative	 the structure of the school year is often one of the few fixed points in young people 's lives .
Argumentative	 for many children , particularly those from poorer families , long summer holidays do n't mean summer camps and foreign holidays , but day after day sitting in front of the tv or hanging around in their neighbourhood .
Argumentative	 all the evidence suggests that boredom is a major factor behind social problems like drug use , youth crime and antisocial behaviour .
Argumentative	 year-round schooling would not get rid of problems like these , of course , but it might help to reduce the level of such behaviour by giving young people something to do .
Argumentative	 for many parents , particularly those with more than one child , summer vacations can be a stressful and difficult time .
Argumentative	 without the structure provided by school attendance , children become bored easily and parents struggle to cope .
Argumentative	 this is especially true for mothers who may be bringing up children without a father present , or those who wish to continue or resume their careers after the first few years of motherhood ; trying to combine a full-time job with the rigours of motherhood is hard but trying to do so during a three month school holiday is almost impossible .
Argumentative	 year-round schooling makes such a work-life balance easier for young parents and allows women to return to the workplace on their own terms .
Argumentative	 evidence suggests that children from lower-income families tend to `` fall behind '' further during long summer vacations .
Argumentative	 these children are less likely to read books , pursue additional studies or take part in useful extracurricular activities compared to their peers from wealthier families .
Argumentative	 this has a knock-on effect on their academic achievement , and once they have fallen behind it is very difficult for them to catch up .
Argumentative	 , this is the logic behind government-funded programs such as head start in the us or sure start in the uk , year-round schooling would remove this important driver of inequality , give students a level playing field on which to learn , and help create a more meritocratic society .
Argumentative	 a nation 's most important resource is its human capital , and in the modern world it is vital to have a skilled , educated workforce in order to remain competitive .
Argumentative	 many nations have already adopted year-round schooling .
Argumentative	 by following their example , we will be giving our young people an important advantage in the employment market and thereby improving the country 's economic prospects .
Argumentative	 year-round schooling often goes hand in hand with multi-tracking , where different groups of students at the same school are on different schedules .
Argumentative	 this has the advantage of allowing school rooms , facilities and other resources to be used more efficiently , thus providing a better education without putting even more strain on government budgets .
