Non-Argumentative	female genital mutilation or fgm is often referred to as 'female circumcision'.
Non-Argumentative	 it refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural, religious or any other non-medical reasons.
Non-Argumentative	 four different types of female genital mutilation are known to be performed today, ranging from piercing or stretching of the clitoris and/or labia to their total removal.
Non-Argumentative	 the most common form of fgm is complete excision of the clitoris and the labia.
Non-Argumentative	 the most extreme form of fgm, called infibulation, replaces the vulva with a wall of flesh, except for a pencil-size opening1.
Non-Argumentative	 after excision, the labia are sewn together and the girl's legs are tied together for around two weeks to prevent her from moving.
Non-Argumentative	the majority of females who have undergone fgm are from twenty-eight african countries, found mostly in the band that stretches from senegal in west africa to somalia on the east coast, and from egypt in the north to tanzania in the south.
Non-Argumentative	 in these regions, it is estimated that more thanmillion girls have undergone this procedure2.
Non-Argumentative	 however, fgm is also practiced in some parts of asia, the middle east and increasingly by african immigrants living in australia, canada and the usa.
Non-Argumentative	 as of today, approximatelymillion women have undergone fgm.
Non-Argumentative	 it is estimated that three million girls each year are likely to be subject to fgm procedures.
Non-Argumentative	even within cultures where fgm is the accepted norm, the procedure, purpose, and typical age at which fgm is performed varies widely.
Non-Argumentative	 fgm is practiced by followers of a religious belief as well as non-believers, for sociological reasons as well as mythical ones.
Non-Argumentative	 fgm is usually carried out with crude medical instruments and without anesthetic, but sometimes may be performed in a health care facility with modern medical amenities.
Non-Argumentative	 fgm can be performed on infants only a few days old, female children or adolescents, or even on mature women3.
Non-Argumentative	 the average age for the majority of fgm procedures, however, is between four and fifteen years of age.
Non-Argumentative	despite these variations of fgm, the world health organization is universally opposed to medicalization of all types of fgm.
Non-Argumentative	 most human rights organizations in the western world, africa and asia consider fgm a violation of human rights4.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents of fgm object to the use of the word "mutilation", arguing that it reinforces the idea that this practice is a violation of human rights.
Non-Argumentative	 they point out that local languages generally use the less judgmental "cutting" to describe the procedure.
Non-Argumentative	 inthe un adopted the term "cutting" to avoid demonizing certain cultures, religions and communities, but the practice is still almost universally referred to as "fgm".
Argumentative	 the proposition will need to prove that a ban would be a justified and effective means of protecting women.
Argumentative	global institutions are better equipped to comparatively analyze the facts about fgm and therefore need to prohibit the practice of fgm so that those ignorant to the consequences of the practice will be protected .
Argumentative	 global organizations are also the only bodies that can ensure that marriage networks give up the practice simultaneously so that no woman is socially handicapped .
Argumentative	 this process proved successful in china in the early 20th century when the practice of foot binding was rapidly abandoned1 .
Argumentative	 it requires sufficient funding for large scale education efforts and adequate enforcement , a financial requirement that only these large organizations can meet2 .
Argumentative	 human rights declarations and treaties , like the un declaration of the rights of the child , which draw upon local cultural and religious notions of common sense , justice and dignity , are often the best way to promote human rights and change the cultural norms that violate them .
Argumentative	 after all , every country has signed up to these universal standards , and it is our moral duty to enforce them , for example by threatening to withhold aid from states which are not serious about tackling the fgm issue .
Argumentative	 benin , burkina faso , central african republic , chad , cote d'ivoire , djibouti , egypt , ministerial decree , ghana , guinea , kenya , niger , nigeria , multiple states , senegal , tanzania , togo , australia , belgium , canada , denmark , new zealand , norway , spain , sweden , united kingdom , and the united states have all banned the practice .
Argumentative	 making this an international policy would support their actions and promote more of the same3 .
Argumentative	 while many believe that fgm is associated with the tenets of a religion , this is in fact not the case .
Argumentative	 different religious leaders condone , deem it irrelevant , or discourage it , but there is no one religion that explicitly says fgm is a necessary practice .
Argumentative	 therefore , banning fgm is not declaring a religion wrong and does not debunk the fundamental beliefs of a group of people .
Argumentative	 instead , it is competing with a cultural practice that shows a woman 's purity , considered to be harmful to her .
Argumentative	 cultures change and adapt as they come into modernity -- foot binding is no longer practiced in china , although it was a deep seeded tradition .
Argumentative	 however , as long as it remains culturally valued for women to be ` cut ' and men only want to marry ` cut ' women the practice will continue .
Argumentative	 therefore , there needs to be a total ban on the practice so that all women are ` uncut ' otherwise , not undergoing the procedure will continue to carry stigma in some societies .
Argumentative	 the practice has been replaced within some groups , with one that celebrates and serves the same purpose , but does not involve cutting .
Argumentative	 fgm is not a necessary part of religion and the fundamental beliefs of the groups that practice it .
Argumentative	 so , it is not insensitive to ban it .
Argumentative	 and , a ban is the only way to make being ` uncut ' the norm within these cultures .
Argumentative	 some rights are inalienable , guaranteed to all human beings and can not be violated with any justification .
Argumentative	 the right to bodily integrity is perhaps the most fundamental right we enjoy as civilized human beings1 .
Argumentative	 fgm is a form of illegal body modification and the mutilation of those too young to give their informed consent .
Argumentative	 most are not given the choice as they would be socially marginalized if they were ` uncut ' .
Argumentative	 genital mutilation may leave a lasting mark on the life and mind of the woman who has undergone it .
Argumentative	 in the longer term , women may suffer feelings of incompleteness , anxiety and depression .
Argumentative	 fgm is also a form of violence against women and a direct expression of patriarchal oppression .
Argumentative	 fgm has been practiced by some cultures solely in order to maintain the chastity and virginity of a woman before marriage , to ensure fidelity during marriage , and to increase male sexual pleasure2 .
Argumentative	 fgm additionally violates her right to equal opportunity , to not be discriminated against , to freedom from violence , injury , abuse , torture , cruel or inhuman treatment , protection from harmful traditional practices and the freedom to make reproductive decisions , all of which are protected under international law3 .
Argumentative	 it takes a woman 's body out of her own control , and ultimately inflicts long term pain and suffering , none of which can be justified .
Argumentative	 immediate complications of female genital mutilation include severe pain , shock , hemorrhage , urine retention , ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue1 .
Argumentative	 hemorrhaging and infection can cause death .
Argumentative	 long-term consequences include cysts and abscesses , keloid scar formation , damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence , dyspareunia , painful sexual intercourse , and sexual dysfunction , as well as difficulties with childbirth2 .
Argumentative	 more recently , concern has arisen about possible transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus , hiv , due to the use of a single instrument in multiple operations3 .
Argumentative	 the fundamental goal of human society is preservation , and it is the responsibility of world-wide organizations to safeguard human sustainability .
Argumentative	 this goal is compromised in cultures that practice fgm .
Argumentative	 deliveries to women who have undergone fgm are significantly more likely to be complicated by caesarean section , postpartum hemorrhage , and episiotomy , extended maternal hospital stay , resuscitation of the infant , and inpatient prenatal death , than deliveries to women who have not had fgm .
Argumentative	 it was estimated in a junewho study thattobabies per thousand births die during delivery as a result of the practice of fgm4 .
Argumentative	 additionally 25-30 % of women who undergo fgm are left infertile5 .
Argumentative	 fgm jeopardizes maternal and infant health and therefore can not be justified .
Argumentative	 the health consequences that it causes mean it should not be allowed to continue .
