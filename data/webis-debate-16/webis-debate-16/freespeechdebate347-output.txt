Non-Argumentative	the proposal met with support from some celebrity magazine editors present at the hearing.
Non-Argumentative	 however, the idea was not received favourably by all.
Non-Argumentative	 the editor of celebrity magazine ok!
Non-Argumentative	, lisa byrne, told the inquiry that the system would not work if all celebrities participated in it.
Non-Argumentative	 the editor of heat magazine, lucie cave, pointed out that such a register would help celebrities present themselves in way at odds with their private conduct, and that it was indeed in the public interest that such double standards are exposed.
Non-Argumentative	 speaking on the bbc, the chief executive officer of pr company outside argued that the register would be “unworkable and impractical” and could harm magazines.
Non-Argumentative	a privacy register is a bad idea for two reasons.
Non-Argumentative	 first of all, it just won’t work.
Non-Argumentative	 like super-injunctions, the privacy register would not stop internet users from reporting and finding out about those who wish to remain private.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover, if it did work, such a register would be a bad thing.
Non-Argumentative	 lucie cave is right: nobody has a right to commercialise their public image and have it protected by the state if it is totally at odds with their private behaviour.
Non-Argumentative	 if i make money and take to the limelight claiming to have a quality that i demonstrably don’t have, then i’m lying.
Non-Argumentative	 and responsible media have not only the right but an obligation to expose such lies.
Non-Argumentative	 it is in the public interest that they do.
Non-Argumentative	 i would hope that lord leveson’s remark was off-hand.
Non-Argumentative	 if he meant what he said, he’s not only about to recommend a bad policy – he’s also shown that he does not understand how the media works, and should work, in the 21st century.
Non-Argumentative	- sebastian huempfern.
Argumentative	b. this will be subject to change once lord leveson publishes his report.
Argumentative	the people who are having their private lives splayed over the tabloids and gossip magazines are not politicians or judges taking bribes , they are not police officers beating up suspects , they are not teachers offering grades in exchange for sexual favours or any other area of sensible journalistic investigation .
Argumentative	 they are people who happen to work in the entertainment industries and their lives are being interrupted for the sake of prurience and curiosity that has nothing to do with a meaningful news agenda .
Argumentative	 if , as some of those mentioned in the introduction suggest , the worst that happens as a result of such a register is that celebrity magazines vanish , then the proposition is quite relaxed about that .
Argumentative	 so what if celebrities have double-standards ?
Argumentative	 so do most people , none of who would appreciate that fact being pointed out on the front pages of the media .
Argumentative	 a paparazzo 's shot of a second or third rate celeb doing something stupid , or something perfectly sensible but just not in makeup -- or clothes -- makes for an easy page lead .
Argumentative	 anything that makes editors pause and consider whether they have something that might actually pass for news might do a great deal to pull large chunks of the british media -- along with the readers they claim to serve -- out of the gutter .
Argumentative	 in recent decades anything with ` celebrity ' associations has been considered news as a sought of kneejerk reaction by editors .
Argumentative	 even in the ` quality ' press there 's still plenty of coverage of vacuous , self-absorbed , talentless individuals who are famous , mostly , for being famous .
Argumentative	 nobody is suggesting that this will transform the media overnight but readers moving away from publications that focussed exclusively on celebrity gossip to publications that , while containing some , also have much more news and analysis of real world events and issues certainly could n't hurt levels of social and political engagement .
Argumentative	 the best way to encourage engagement is through education , which the media can provide .
