Non-Argumentative	the past two decades have seen rapid and overwhelming progress in rwanda, a country that was hit by the worst post cold war atrocity inwhen up to a million people perished in genocide.
Non-Argumentative	 therwanda genocide against the tutsi destroyed the country leaving no standing government institution, and no infrastructure and public services.
Non-Argumentative	 it also left a large number of widows and orphans and a population traumatised by what it had witnessed and in many cases engaged in.
Non-Argumentative	 there seemed no hope of a future.
Non-Argumentative	 it was therefore the responsibility of the new government to revive this perishing state.
Non-Argumentative	 surprisingly within onlyyears, rwanda has been hailed for its outstanding economic progress, the implementation of millennium development goals, improvement of infrastructure, health care, education, zero tolerance to corruption, gender empowerment and security.
Non-Argumentative	 foreign aid to support the country’s budget has also been reduced from 100% into 40% in[1].
Non-Argumentative	however the past five years has seen growing criticism against the rwandan leadership internationally.
Non-Argumentative	 activists and journalists are condemning the government for its laws that limit freedom of press and expression in the country.
Non-Argumentative	 the media is not very diverse and is concentrated in the capital kigali.
Non-Argumentative	 some outlets are privately-owned but government-controlled ones (radio rwanda and the national tv station tvr) dominate.
Non-Argumentative	 some independent newspapers have been pressured into closing down by the government.
Non-Argumentative	 relations between the government and foreign media are also very difficult [2] and rwanda has dropped more thanplaces on the world press freedom index to 162nd – where with the possible exception of iran its neighbours in the list are all dictatorships [3].
Non-Argumentative	 additionally, amnesty international has stated that it is unsafe to speak out in rwanda due to restrictions on freedom of expression[4].
Non-Argumentative	 in response, the government down plays these critics by pointing out that the media played a big part in preparing and carrying out genocide.
Non-Argumentative	 outlets such as radio télévision libre des milles collines (rtlm) and the newspaper kangura encouraged genocide and helped direct militias and so there is need for a certain degree of restriction[5].
Non-Argumentative	 observers blame kagame’s authoritarian style of leadership for this [4], but it appears that, for the time being at least, many rwandans are also scared of political freedom and freedom of expression for the instability they might trigger.
Argumentative	 can this hinder economic development and progress?
Argumentative	president kagame though considered a visionary leader has made rwanda a country based on one man 's ideas .
Argumentative	 he has silenced critics , opposition and any counter arguments that may not support his opinions through tough rules imposed against the media and free speech .
Argumentative	 this sparked misunderstandings within the government forcingfour high rank officials in exile , one , an ex-intelligence chief was recently murdered in south africa  .
Argumentative	 rwanda is essentially a hard-line , one-party , secretive police state with a façade of democracy  .
Argumentative	 to avoid future conflict and government break down kagame needs to convene a genuine , inclusive , unconditional and comprehensive national dialogue with the aim of preparing and strengthening the country 's future progress .
Argumentative	 the fact that most rwandans still want him to run for re-election after his two terms inshows how much he has controlled people to believe he is the only potential leader in a country of more thanmillion citizens .
Argumentative	 if rwanda is to have a stable future democracy it needs to be recognised that the opposition are patriots too and should be entitled to freedom of speech and press to give them an opportunity to share their views on how the country can be improved .
Argumentative	 for democracy in rwanda to progress the country needs to accept the idea of freedom of speech and a ` loyal opposition ' .
Argumentative	  one of the major factors that exacerbated genocide ideology was the `` akazu '' controlled media which made most of the hutu population wrongfully obey authority and government propaganda of divisionism  .
Argumentative	 this was achieved by proclaiming that the tutsi are snakes and cockroaches in newspapers , and directing the hutu extremists to where killings were to be conducted on radio rtlm .
Argumentative	 meanwhile they also refused to broadcast speeches calling out for unity among people helping to lead to the assassination of the then prime minister agathe uwilingiyimana who opposed government restrictions .
Argumentative	 there was no space to question policies and ideas that were encouraging genocide by manipulating people to believe it was right path for rwanda .
Argumentative	 the genocide should therefore serve as an example that restricting freedoms of speech and press can cause severe damage .
Argumentative	 this is especially harmful to a healing and reconciling country like rwanda that needs the freedom to debate the past and analyse how far it has come openly .
Argumentative	 rwanda should learn from the past that freedom of speech is necessary to prevent conflict while having only one side potentially exacerbates it .
Argumentative	 rwanda , though a progressing country is still aid dependent which has been a backbone for its achievements today  .
Argumentative	 spoiling rwanda 's relations with the international community would therefor be destabilising rwanda 's focus and growth .
Argumentative	 this has been evident when some countries cut aid to rwanda recently following allegations of the government supporting insecurity in congo  .
Argumentative	 most donor governments are strong backers of human rights and freedom .
Argumentative	 continued restrictions to freedom of speech may provoke international reaction through cutting aid and trade ties a move that may hinder the success of rwanda 's goals .
Argumentative	 aid has been cut on other human rights issues for example donor countries have recently acted to cut aid to uganda as a result of their criminalisation of homosexuality .
