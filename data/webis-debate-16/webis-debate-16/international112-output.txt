Non-Argumentative	 if this fails, involuntary repatriation can be considered1.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents of repatriation insist a hard stance is necessary to deter future immigrants and reduce criminal activity.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents maintain however that the threat is overblown and that is both more expensive and dangerous to repatriate than to integrate illegal immigrants.

Argumentative	 the motion of repatriating 'all' illegal immigrants in itself implies the inclusion of involuntary repatriation, since there are bound to be illegal immigrants that do not want to go back to their home country.
Argumentative	the only way to stop the problem of illegal immigration is to take a hard-line stance and adopt policies of repatriation .
Argumentative	 this means that illegal immigrants , after it has been proven through a fair hearing that they have no legitimate reason to stay , will be granted a period of voluntary repatriation , where they receive counselling and help to return to their country .
Argumentative	 if this does not work , and the illegal immigrant wants to stay , he or she will forced to repatriate .
Argumentative	 repatriation is needed because illegal immigrants are residing in a country which is different from their country of origin , without fulfilling the legal requirements to do so .
Argumentative	 they also do not make the same contributions to the state as other people do , such as paying taxes .
Argumentative	 this means that illegal immigrants are actively harming the legal system , the citizens of the country and legal immigrants .
Argumentative	 at the same time , the number of illegal immigrants is rising every year , with an estimated 11.5-12 million illegal immigrants living in the us alone1 .
Argumentative	 these kind of numbers show that the rules on immigration need to come with tough sanctions to ensure that they are not exploited or broken in the future .
Argumentative	 repatriation is necessary because it targets successful illegal immigrants and ensures a comprehensive immigration policy that aims to reduce illegal immigration .
Argumentative	 what this policy of repatriation will do , is that it firstly will reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the country , which will lead to a decline of harms caused by them .
Argumentative	 secondly , it will act as a strong deterrence for future immigrants .

Argumentative	 repatriating illegal immigrants would lead to fewer opportunities for criminal networks to gain entry to the country .
Argumentative	 illegal immigration is linked to dangerous criminal activity such as people and drug trafficking , terrorism and the sex trade .
Argumentative	 an estimated000 victims of human trafficking live in industrialized countries , of whom% are forced into commercial sexual exploitation , mostly women and girls1 .

Argumentative	 illegal immigrants cost the state in money , time and resources .
Argumentative	 it is difficult to give an accurate number on the cost of illegal immigrants for the rest of the population , the federation for american immigration reform , fair , has come up with numbers as high as $ 1,183 per household in the state of california1 , but they are likely to put a strain on resources by not paying taxes whilst demanding social services such as healthcare and education .
Argumentative	 as a result , they take taxpayer 's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state .
Argumentative	 moreover , illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions .
Argumentative	 this is harmful to lawful residents because it takes employment opportunities away from them and encourages employers to seek illegal labour in order to keep costs down .

Argumentative	 this includes the supreme authority to decide who should be allowed into and out of the country .
Argumentative	 illegal immigrants have breached that sovereignty by arriving uninvited and attempting to circumvent checks .
Argumentative	 these people should be deported in order to maintain the sovereignty of the nation .
Argumentative	 the united nations recognises the sovereign rights of members when it says `` nothing contained in the present charter shall authorize the united nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state .
Argumentative	 ``who is allowed to be resident in the state is an internal consideration .
