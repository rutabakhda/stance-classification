Non-Argumentative	elections are the lifeblood of all democracies; they are where the people have the chance to make their choice of government, often after years where their only real influence has been through protest and the media.
Non-Argumentative	 yet not all countries that have elections are really democratic.
Non-Argumentative	 elections have become close to universal with many countries that are ‘autocratic’ also having elections just like any democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 these elections are often a sham in the sense that there is no real chance of there being a change in government as a result of the vote.
Non-Argumentative	 thus we might consider there to be another criteria beyond simply holding elections that determines if a country is truly democratic; whether the elections they hold are ‘free and fair’.
Non-Argumentative	in the declaration on free and fair elections the inter-parliamentary council set out numerous conditions for elections qualifying as free and fair including:“voting rightsparty rightsresponsibilities of states… to guarantee the rights and institutional framework for periodic and genuine, free and fair elections”there are many ways in which there may be elections within an autocratic setting.
Non-Argumentative	 in a few cases the ‘democratic element’ is purely for show; qatar is from this year (2013) holding elections (currently suspended due to a handover of power) for its advisory council but as an advisory body it is clear the real power will remain with the emir.
Non-Argumentative	 it is much more usual that the ruling party simply ensures that the opposition can never get enough seats to form a majority.
Non-Argumentative	 this may be done in several different ways.
Non-Argumentative	 in burma (myanmar) for example the national league for democracy faces a parliament where many of the seats are not contested in elections, in the house of representatives the ruling union solidarity and development party hasseats, of whichwere directly appointed.
Non-Argumentative	 the main opposition the national league for democracy wonout of theseats it contested in byelections showing that it would likely win if there were an election without restrictions.
Non-Argumentative	 alternatively as in zimbabwe there may be intimidation and violence in the elections themselves.
Non-Argumentative	 or the results may be determined in advance through ballot stuffing, vote rigging, and bussing in supporters so they vote several times as occurs in russia.
Non-Argumentative	 the methods may be different but the outcome is the same; certain victory for the ruling party.
Argumentative	 holding sham elections is fundamentally dishonest as it is asking the people to choose a government and then ignoring their choice .
Argumentative	 not holding elections is at least honestly telling the people that they get no say in who is in power .
Argumentative	 holding a sham election inevitably means having to lie to the people somewhere along the line ; whether it is in preventing people registering , or voting , or in manipulating the results .
Argumentative	 the people usually know the result is a sham or at least are suspicious -- in the latest zimbabwean election the headlines in the newspapers included `` zanu-pf gloats over victory '' .
Argumentative	 without a sham election the government can at least be honest with their people so enabling a level of trust or even a kind of contract between the two -- the government and the people each lets the other get on with it .
Argumentative	 thus for example in china trust in government inwas% against the world average of% .
Argumentative	 it is hard to see what the benefit of an election that can change nothing is , but there are certainly all the costs associated with a normal election .
Argumentative	 elections can be costly in financial terms , the united states elections cost several billion dollars but even much smaller and less extravagant elections need financing .
Argumentative	 zimbabwe 's elections inforced the government to ask its neighbours for $million to carry out the polls , for a nation that is essentially bankrupt this is a lot of money .
Argumentative	 another cost is uncertainty .
Argumentative	 in fully democratic elections the uncertainty is with what the policies will be when the government changes .
Argumentative	 with sham elections the uncertainty is whether the elections will be a focus for violence .
Argumentative	 sometimes this is during campaigning itself as with zimbabwe inwhere up topeople were killed .
Argumentative	 otherwise violence occurs when there is a perception that an election has been stolen so the green movement in iran took to the streets and was met with a violent crackdown in.
Argumentative	 democracy and elections are about popularity but popular decisions are not always the right ones .
Argumentative	 even mature democracies have sometimes seen their government 's make use of the levers of government to boost their electoral chances ; for example margaret thatcher 's government stoked the economy in the lawson boom inwhich just happened to be an election year .
Argumentative	 governments without elections can engage in long term planning and make unpopular decisions without fear of the consequences .
Argumentative	 thus for example saudi arabia is willing to pump less oil , and so get less money in the short term at least , in order to create stability in the oil market by having enough excess capacity to prevent price spikes .
Argumentative	 not having any elections -- or only elections for a powerless advisory parliament -- may actually have a benefit in putting responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the rulers .
Argumentative	 only a country that is comparatively well governed , or successful , can manage without a democratic safety valve .
Argumentative	 it is notable that the remaining absolute monarchies or those where the king rules as well as reigns are mostly very wealthy petro states .
Argumentative	 several of the remaining communist regimes , china and vietnam , rely on rapid economic growth to cement their legitimacy combined with meritocracy in their selection of leaders .
Argumentative	 in both cases there is an incentive for good governance by those in power as they are in for the long term .
Argumentative	 the leaders know they are not going to be elected out of office so have the motivation to reduce corruption and create long term growth through investment in infrastructure because this will benefit them in the future .
