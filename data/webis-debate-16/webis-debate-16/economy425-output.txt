Non-Argumentative	urbanisation is what once formed civilisation.
Non-Argumentative	 when we as a species transitioned from living in small communities that were dedicated to farming and small scale production to cities in which large amounts of people were gathered to produce and to consume, the stage was set, first for the renaissance and later for the industrial revolution.
Non-Argumentative	 in today’s society, urbanisation is still the trend, inthe world for the first time had more than half of the world’s population lived in towns and cities and this is projected to increase to 60% by 2030.
Non-Argumentative	 while international migration often exercises national politics internal migration is much larger in terms of total numbers; while there were 190million international migrants in 2005, china alone had around the same number of internal migrants.
Non-Argumentative	 however, with increased mobility and a smaller need for manual labour, it is been put into doubt whether the cities can handle the vast amounts of people who enter on a daily basis.
Non-Argumentative	 this is particularly problematic in developing nations where any city already has innate problems which might be exacerbated by the influx of more people.
Non-Argumentative	 in major cities, such as nairobi and johannesburg, large townships have appeared, often as large in themselves as major european cities, where poor people lead a parallel existence, separated from the urban community.
Non-Argumentative	 attempts have been made, in particular in china, to impose policies that keep people in the rural communities from moving into the cities, in order to stem the flow of domestic migration.
Non-Argumentative	 china’s hukou system is one of china’s major social controls with the aim of directly regulating population distribution.
Non-Argumentative	 it links chinese citizens access to state benefits, and sometimes jobs, to the individual staying where they are registered.
Non-Argumentative	 this does not prevent rural to urban migration, as it is possible to change status, but it does attempt to control migration.
Non-Argumentative	in this debate the government would make it illegal for people in the countryside to move into the cities without first receiving permission from the authorities.
Non-Argumentative	 failing to recognise the ban would lead to deportation to the community from whence the individual came and possibly other sanctions.
Non-Argumentative	 this could be done through border controls or more probably by linking each individual’s identity to their community, by means of passports or social identity numbers, to make it impossible to live a functional life in the city without permission.
Argumentative	 man is a social being .
Argumentative	 therefore people live in communities where decisions that affect the many , are taken by representatives of the many .
Argumentative	 thus , a social contract exists between the people and their government .
Argumentative	 in exchange for part of their autonomy and freedom , the government ensures that policies are made in the best interest of people , even if this might come at the expense of short-term interests for some individuals .
Argumentative	 this is a typical example of this kind of case .
Argumentative	 the trend is emptying the countryside , stopping the production of agricultural goods and hollowing the amenities provided by the cities .
Argumentative	 even if each individual has a personal incentive to move to the cities , the harm to the cities is greater than their accumulated individual gains .
Argumentative	 it is in these cases that the state must act to protect its people and ensure long term benefits .
Argumentative	 cities are very appealing to poor people .
Argumentative	 even if their living standards in cities might be unacceptable , they get closer to basic goods , such as fresh water , sanitation etc, however , these things exist because there are productive people in the cities who work and pay taxes .
Argumentative	 what happens when too many people come at the same time is that public money is stretched too thinly and these basic goods can no longer be provided .
Argumentative	 this leads to severe humanitarian problems such as malnutrition , thirst , lack of medication , etc, however , this humanitarian crisis does not only harm those directly affected , it also creates an unattractive environment for business .
Argumentative	 thus , people who enter the city can not find work , as production does not grow in relation to the people who enter .
Argumentative	 they become excluded from society and often turn to crime , which further erodes the economy .
Argumentative	 limiting migration to reasonable levels give the cities a chance to develop progressively and become the kind of places that people in rural areas currently believe them to be .
Argumentative	 unlimited rural-urban migration erodes the economy of the cities , as shown in the previous argument , and limits their economic growth and available resources .
Argumentative	 on a national level , this causes decision makers to prioritise the cities , as the country relies more on urban than rural areas , thus preventing them from investing in the country-side .
Argumentative	 china is a good example of this where urban privilege has become entrenched with ` special economic zones ' being created in urban areas , though sometimes built from scratch in rural areas , with money being poured into infrastructure for the urban areas which as a result have rapidly modernised leaving rural areas behind .
Argumentative	 this leads to a whole culture of divisions where urbanites consider those from rural areas to be backward and less civilized .
Argumentative	 moreover , there will be little other reason to invest in rural areas , as the workforce in those areas has left for the cities .
Argumentative	 by preserving resources in the cities and keeping the workforce in the rural areas , it becomes possible to invest in rural communities and change their lives for the better as these areas maintain the balanced workforce necessary to attract investors .
Argumentative	 the cause of rural-urban migration in developing nations and the main reason why it becomes problematic is that people who move to the cities are not making informed decisions .
Argumentative	 they are led to believe that the cities contain opportunities that they can not find where they live , and there are no mechanisms such as efficient media or adequate education to eradicate this misconception .
Argumentative	 myths can be easily propagated by a single successful migrant returning home to visit that then attracts many others to try their luck without any knowledge of the possible costs .
Argumentative	 this is exacerbated by unscrupulous organisations that prey on their desperation to take all their money to organise their move to the city .
Argumentative	 some of those who are trafficked find themselves brought to the city and exploited through forced labour , begging , or even prostitution .
Argumentative	 many of those who move to cities find themselves in a worse situation but have lost any moving power they originally had and are thus trapped .
