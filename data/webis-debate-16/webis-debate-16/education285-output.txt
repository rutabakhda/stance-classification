Argumentative	in many religions and cultures the role of the mother is a sacred one .
Argumentative	 the bible , specifically in scriptures timothy 5:14 and titus: 4-5 , focuses on women 's role as ` keepers of the house ' , who should bear children and raise them in the way of the lord .
Argumentative	 in proverbs: 28-31 women as a whole are praised for the successful raising of children and home , and as such this role is valued more than a mother working .

Argumentative	 hindu scriptures similarly often state that one must worship his or her mother first , vanparva313 .60 , apastamba dharmsutra i. 10.28.9 .
