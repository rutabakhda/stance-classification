Non-Argumentative	the united states has perhaps the most arcane method of selecting its chief executive of any nation, one no country has chosen to emulate.
Non-Argumentative	   there are a total ofvotes in the electoral college, so a successful candidate needsto win.
Non-Argumentative	  because all but two states cast their electoral votes as a unit, a candidate can win some states by narrow margins, lose others by large margins, and thus win the electoral vote while losing the popular vote.
Non-Argumentative	  this last occurred in the election of george w. bush in 2000.
Non-Argumentative	the founders had no political theory or coherent design in creating the electoral college, but they did have a number of motivations for doing so.
Non-Argumentative	  some were concerned about legislative intrigue and executive dependence on the legislature, so they wanted some mode for choosing the president other than legislative selection.
Non-Argumentative	  others worried about mob rule if the voters directly selected the president and feared the electoral legitimacy direct election would provide the executive.
Non-Argumentative	  still others felt voters would not know of distinguished men in other parts of the country, requiring intermediaries to identify the best candidates.
Non-Argumentative	  finally, the electoral college was a mechanism to protect slave interests, because slave states would receive credit for three-fifths of their slaves in the apportionment of electoral votes even though the slaves could not vote in an election.
Non-Argumentative	  all of these intentions are now irrelevant in evaluating the electoral college.
Non-Argumentative	there is no question that it violates core democratic principles, such as equality in voting.
Non-Argumentative	  are there compensations for this violation that justify maintaining it?
Non-Argumentative	  supporters of the electoral college argue that it protects small states, forces candidates to seek broad support, and helps to maintain the two-party system.
Non-Argumentative	  opponents respond that the electoral college ensures that candidates ignore most of the country, especially small states, in their campaigning, as they attend only to swing states; and that the system encourages third parties.
Non-Argumentative	the electoral college has consistently proven to be unpopular with the public.
Non-Argumentative	  every gallup poll taken on the subject has found clear majorities supporting direct election of the president.
Non-Argumentative	the existence of the electoral college is an arcane piece of electoral history but one with important consequences.
Non-Argumentative	  as a result, it remains a hot button contemporary issue.
Argumentative	  under the electoral college , all votes do not count equally .
Argumentative	 voters in some states have more say in selecting the president than voters in other states .
Argumentative	 for example , california haselectoral college votes , while delaware only getvotes .
Argumentative	 there is not equality in that , every state should be equal , california for voting purposes is no more important that delaware .
Argumentative	 in and probably, the candidate receiving the most votes for president lost the election .
Argumentative	 this occurs because all but two states award all their electoral votes to the candidate winning a plurality in the state ; because all states receive two electoral votes corresponding to their two us senators ; because the number of house seats , which serve as the basis of the remaining electoral votes , often poorly match the population of the state ; because states cast electoral votes no matter how many people actually vote ; and because the size of the house is arbitrary .
Argumentative	 this provision allows thesmallest states with a population of about 4.9 million to outvote thelargest states with a population ofmillion .
Argumentative	 this is blatently unfair .
Argumentative	 in, ralph nader siphoned a few votes from al gore in new hampshire and florida , costing gore victories and thus the election .
Argumentative	 nevertheless , gore was the preferred choice of voters in a match up with george w. bush .
Argumentative	 there is no incentive for candidates to mobilize voters in states they are sure to win -- or sure to lose , and voters have little incentive to vote in noncompetitive states where their vote is likely not to matter .
Argumentative	 some states like texas just have a fairly predictable voting record - they have voted republicanout of the lastpresidential elections .
Argumentative	 democratic presidential candidates do not spend much time in texas for that reason .
