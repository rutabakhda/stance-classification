Non-Argumentative	using the electoral system of proportional representation (pr) means that the percentage of the popular vote that a party wins becomes the percentage of the seats that party receives in parliament.
Non-Argumentative	 the person elected to sit in that parliament is usually decided by means of party lists, where the party lists its candidates in order; if it winsseats in parliament, the firstcandidates on its list are elected as members of that parliament.
Non-Argumentative	 many countries use it for national elections, though there are variations in how it is done.
Non-Argumentative	other countries do not operate pr in elections but use majoritarian systems instead, which give the majority of the seats to the party with a plurality of the vote.
Non-Argumentative	 under this system each constituency (a defined geographical area) elects its own representative(s) from among a group of rival candidates competing only for that constituency.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk, elections are organised on a first past the post (fptp) basis, where the candidate with the highest number of votes is elected to represent that constituency; in an area where more than two parties attract significant support this usually means the winner has little more than 40% of the popular vote (a scottish mp was once elected with only 28% of the votes in a tight four-party contest).
Non-Argumentative	 in australia, the alternative vote (av) system is used, where voters list candidates in order of preference; candidates with the fewest votes are progressively eliminated from the count and their ballots are individually transferred to the voter's next preference until one candidate receives over 50% support and is duly elected.
Non-Argumentative	the above outline simplifies the situation in most countries, where varying forms of pr may be used, perhaps by having very large constituencies with multiple representatives elected by pr from party lists, or by using pr for some elections and a constituency system for others.
Argumentative	 recently, italy has moved away from pr while the uk has begun to use it for elections to the european parliament and in the new scottish, welsh, northern ireland and london assemblies.
Argumentative	adversarial democratic systems such as the united states , britain and australia have been becoming increasingly dysfunctional with politics simply being a shouting match .
Argumentative	 coalition governments lead to cooperation and compromise between parties1 .
Argumentative	 governments which are forced to acknowledge a wide range of public opinion are less likely to introduce policies which victimise minorities or ride roughshod over public opinion for ideological reasons ; for example , the poll tax in the uk , 1988-92 .
Argumentative	 empirically , countries with pr systems , such as germany , show that great prosperity can result from the policies of such governments .
Argumentative	 pr results in more engagement in politics as every vote counts1 .
Argumentative	 political participation is good and we should care about the low voter turnout in elections that has been caused by first past the post .
Argumentative	 surveys show that that those who vote are more engaged in the community in other ways and have better personal wellbeing .
Argumentative	 research in switzerland has shown that voting does make people happier as well as being better informed citizens .
Argumentative	 the higher the stake the person has , and the more likely their vote is to count the more effort they will make to find out the facts so as to make informed choices .2 2 marks et al.
Argumentative	  p5-6 first past the post , fptp , often results in a party without majority support being able to dominate parliament .
Argumentative	 minority parties , such as the green party and ukip , in the uk , which can win 5-10 % or so of the vote all over the country , can fail to win a single seat .
Argumentative	 in the ukgeneral election , ukip received 919,546 votes across the country , but not a single seat1 .
Argumentative	 parties with a uniform vote across the country are punished unfairly .
Argumentative	 thus in singapore 's general election ofthe national solidarity party contestedseats and won 39.25 % of the valid votes across the wards it contested yet still failed to win any seats .2 theoretically parties could win huge numbers of votes , potentially up to% in every constituency , without ever getting any representation in parliament .
Argumentative	 as such fptp favours parties that appeal to local issues or to particular segments of the population these parties that are losing out are likely to be those parties that either appeal to a broad segment of the population or whose support is based upon an issue that affects everyone .
Argumentative	 furthermore , in the ukgeneral election , two thirds of mps were elected without receiving a majority of the votes in their constituency3 .
Argumentative	 this suggests that most people are being represented by people they did n't vote for .
Argumentative	 all political parties have seats that they consider safe and unlikely to lose .
Argumentative	 if a person in an inner city constituency that has a strong labour history , wishes to vote for someone other than labour , then their vote is effectively null and void .
Argumentative	 labour will win a majority however they vote .
Argumentative	 the fact that the seat is so safe means that there is effectively very little effect people can have , resulting in thousands of people 's vote being wasted and having no effect when it comes to forming a government .
Argumentative	 in theuk general election the result was decided by less than 460,000 voters in onlyconstituencies .
Argumentative	 this gives an unfair amount of political influence to a tiny minority of the electorate while making the majority 's votes close to worthless .
