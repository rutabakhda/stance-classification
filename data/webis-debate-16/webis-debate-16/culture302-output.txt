Non-Argumentative	“1, seeking ways and means of facilitating bilateral negotiations for the restitution or return of cultural property to its countries of origin…2, promoting multilateral and bilateral cooperation with a view to the restitution and return of cultural property to its countries of origin;3.
Non-Argumentative	 encouraging the necessary research and studies for the establishment of coherent programmes for the constitution of representative collections in countries whose cultural heritage has been dispersed;4.
Non-Argumentative	 fostering a public information campaign on  the real nature, scale and scope of the problem of the restitution or return of cultural property to its countries of origin”as well as this it guides implementation of unesco programmes on such restitution, encourages establishment of museums and provides training for the care of cultural properties and promotes exchanges.
Non-Argumentative	the debate about the return of cultural property to countries of origin is most often argued in terms of the elgin (or parthenon) marbles, masterpieces of classical greek sculpture removed from the parthenon in athens inby lord elgin, and sold to the british museum in london in 1816.
Non-Argumentative	 greece has consistently demanded the return of these national treasures since independence in 1830, which britain has consistently refused.
Non-Argumentative	 the marbles are part of a wider debate about the ownership and display of cultural treasures, often acquired from the developing world by imperial powers in the 18th and 19th centuries, and now displayed in western museums.
Non-Argumentative	 the british museum’s charter implies that the institution cannot legally return items from its collection: "the trustees of the british museum hold its collections in perpetuity by virtue of the power vested in them by the british museum act (1963)".
Non-Argumentative	 yet the debate rages: should cultural property such as the parthenon marbles be returned to its country of origin?
Argumentative	 cultural treasures should be displayed in the context in which they originated ; only then can they be truly valued and understood .
Argumentative	 in the case of the parthenon marbles this is an architectural context which only proximity to the parthenon itself can provide .
Argumentative	 in the british museum they appear as mere disconnected fragments , stripped of any emotional meaning .
Argumentative	 it may also be useful for academics to have a cultural property in its original context in order to be able to understand it , for example a carved door may be a beautiful artefact but it can not be truly understood unless we know what the door was used for , where it leads too something for which it is necessary to see the context .
Argumentative	 cultural and historical tourism is an important source of income for many countries , and is especially important for developing countries .
Argumentative	 if their artefacts have been appropriated by foreign museums in wealthy nations then they are being deprived of the economic opportunity to build a successful tourist trade .
Argumentative	 both the treasures themselves are being devalued as is the experience of seeing the treasures .
Argumentative	 display of cultural treasures in western museums may be seen as a last hangover from the imperial belief that `` civilised '' states such as britain were the true cultural successors to ancient greece and rome , and that the ` barbarian ' inhabitants of those ancient regions were unable to appreciate or look after their great artistic heritage .
Argumentative	 whether that was true in the 19th century is open to doubt ; it certainly is not valid today and the display of imperial trophies in institutions such as the british museum or the louvre is a reminder to many developing nations of their past oppression .
Argumentative	 for instance , the british museum is refusing to returnof the benin bronzes to nigeria despite repeated requests by the nigerian government .
Argumentative	 the rosetta stone has been the subject of demands by the egyptian government but remains in london .
Argumentative	 these artefacts become almost souvenirs of imperialism , a way of retaining cultural ownership long after the political power of britain has faded .
Argumentative	 returning them would be a gesture of goodwill and cooperation .
Argumentative	 artefacts were often acquired illegally .
Argumentative	 elgin , for instance , appropriated the parthenon marbles from the ottoman authorities who had invaded greece and were arguably not the rightful owners of the site ; he took advantage of political turmoil to pillage these ancient statues .
Argumentative	 doubt has even been cast on the legality of thedocument which purportedly gave elgin permission to remove the marbles .
Argumentative	 the axum obelisk was seized from ethiopia by mussolini as a trophy of war ; fortunately the injustice of this action has since been recognised and the obelisk was restored to its rightful place in.
Argumentative	 it may have been true that countries such as greece were not capable of looking after their heritage in the past , but that has now changed .
Argumentative	 since5 greece has been carefully restoring the acropolis and athens now has a secure environment to maintain the marbles .
Argumentative	 the state-of-the-art new acropolis museum , which cost $ 200m , has now been completed to house the surviving marbles , and even contains a replica of the temple , thus the marbles would appear as being exactly the same as on the real temple .
Argumentative	 pollution control measures , such as installing pollution monitoring stations throughout metropolitan athens and ensuring that motor vehicles must comply with emission standards , have reduced sulphur-dioxide levels in the city to a fifth of their previous levels .
Argumentative	 at the same time the curatorship of institutions such as the british museum is being called into question , as it becomes apparent that controversial cleaning and restoration practices may have harmed the sculptures they claim to protect .
Argumentative	 in the 1930s the british museum 's attempt to clean them using chisels caused irreparable damage .
Argumentative	 they have also been irresponsible when it comes to protecting the fate of many of its artefacts : `` the british museum has sold off more thancontroversial benin bronzes for as little as #each since, it has emerged '' ; `` the museum now regrets the sales '' .
