Non-Argumentative	the united kingdom held its first national referendum, or direct-democracy vote, in 1975.
Non-Argumentative	 this vote confirmed uk membership of the european economic community (eec).
Non-Argumentative	 since 1975, the eec has evolved into the european union (eu), a political as well as economic coalition of countries that fundamentally alters its member states' sovereignty.
Non-Argumentative	 the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, the right of parliament to make or unmake any law, has traditionally been the cornerstone of the british political system.
Non-Argumentative	 but given that eu law now supersedes uk law, proponents of holding a referendum argue that the political system and even the social contract have been fundamentally altered without the permission of uk citizens.1 meanwhile, opponents of the referendum insist that eu membership is too important to gamble on uninformed public opinion and that referendums are inconsistent with the british tradition of representative democracy.
Non-Argumentative	this motion proposes that government should hold a referendum on eu membership and maintain or end membership of the eu dependent upon which option receives the most votes.1 elliott, mark.

Argumentative	the general public will be appeased :% of voters want the vote held .1 mps will fulfil their duty to represent constituent interests by calling the referendum .
Argumentative	 a contented electorate will be more supportive of government and feel included in political life .
Argumentative	 not only individuals but also parties will be appeased : the far left and right each feel strongly about this issue .
Argumentative	 euroskeptic parties like ukip and the bnp have agitated for an in-or-out vote for years , and disguise racism and anti-immigrant sentiment as euroskepticism in the process .
Argumentative	 a vote either way would settle the issue and make it harder for them to disguise antisocial aspects of their platforms .
Argumentative	 pro-europeans like the lib dems also want the referendum : leader nick clegg said that `` nothing will do more damage to the pro-european movement than giving room to the suspicion that we have something to hide ``by not holding one .
Argumentative	 both sides of the political spectrum wants this issue definitively settled .
Argumentative	 once it has been , politicians will be able to redirect focus and work on crucial issues like the economy .
Argumentative	 parliamentary and logistic precedents indicate that holding a referendum about an issue of sovereignty is practical and practicable .
Argumentative	 there have been two successfully-held national referendums , one the direct antecedent of this one , theeec vote , and one recently , theav vote .
Argumentative	 the history of national referendums therefore indicates that they are both constitutional and logistically viable .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the referendum is legitimized by public desire .
Argumentative	 a bbc poll inindicated that% would vote ` no ' to eu membership if a referendum was held , a level of dissatisfaction which indicates the need for a public discussion and vote .1 the public deserve to vote in this referendum because it regards a constitutional issue -- sovereignty .
Argumentative	 beyond constitutionality , referendums maintain democratic society when the public 's views and mps ' clearly misalign , as they do in this case .
Argumentative	 this vote will also maintain the established precedent of holding referendums on eu issues .
Argumentative	 if the british people had to be consulted on eec membership , as happened in, they must be consulted on eu membership : the current eu barely resembles the eec that the uk voted to join long ago , but has greatly magnified stature and power .
Argumentative	 a referendum , regardless of the result , will prove an effective public relations boost for the united kingdom .
Argumentative	 uk citizens will feel more confident in their government , as some currently see eu membership as an illegitimate breach of the social contract and others argue that the uk is not doing enough to co-operate .
Argumentative	 europeans also will improve their view of the united kingdom : a `` yes '' vote will minimize the perception of the uk as a foot-dragging , reluctant participant in europe ; a `` no '' vote will be seen to end a half-hearted charade .
Argumentative	 either way , a more straightforward relationship with europe will minimize uk-europe mistrust , which will benefit each politically and economically .
