Non-Argumentative	in some countries, like the u.k., japan, hong kong, and several african countries, school uniforms are worn in almost every school.
Non-Argumentative	 in other countries, like france and germany, school uniforms are only worn in a few schools, or even none.
Non-Argumentative	 however, in some of these countries opinions are changing.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, both france1 and germany2 have recently considered bringing school uniforms back, and in the u.s.a. the percentage of public schools in which children wear a uniform has increased from 11.8 in 1999-2000 to 17.5 in 2007-20083.
Non-Argumentative	 on the other hand, some schools in the u.k. have gotten rid of school uniforms4.
Argumentative	 with such different rules in these different countries, it is important to think about whether or not school uniforms are really necessary, and why.
Argumentative	if children are religious , they should be allowed to wear the clothes that express their religion , but school a uniform can often restrict this .
Argumentative	 religious beliefs can be extremely valuable and important to many children , giving their lives a great deal of meaning and structure and inspiring them to work hard and behave compassionately in a school environment .
Argumentative	 some religions place a great deal of value upon worn symbols of faith , such as turbans , headdresses and bracelets .
Argumentative	 when a school demands that a child remove these symbols , it inadvertently attacks something central to that child 's life .
Argumentative	 this may cause the child to see her school and her faith as mutually exclusive institutions  .
Argumentative	 vulnerable young people should not be forced into an adversarial relationship with their school , as close , collaborative involvement with teaching and learning techniques will greatly effect a child 's ability to adapt , learn and acquire new skills in the future .
Argumentative	 for example , school skirts are often not long enough for muslim girls , who believe that they should cover most of their bodies .
Argumentative	 to allow children to express their religions , we should get rid of school uniforms .
Argumentative	 rather than having school uniform , why not have a dress code instead ?
Argumentative	 this has all the benefits of uniform without the many disadvantages .
Argumentative	 while uniforms force all children to wear the same clothes , dress codes give students a lot of choice what to wear .
Argumentative	 only a few unsuitable things are banned - for example , gang colors , very short skirts , crop tops , bare shoulders , etc, school uniforms are often not very comfortable or practical .
Argumentative	 in state schools , schools for which parents do n't have to pay fees , in the u.k. , for example , girls often have to wear dresses or skirts , when they might feel more comfortable in trousers , and boys often have to wear button-up shirts and ties , which can also be uncomfortable for active children  .
Argumentative	 in independent schools , uniforms are often even more impractical and uncomfortable , with blazers or even tailcoats for the children to wear  .
Argumentative	 if a school has a uniform , parents are expected to buy it , and then buy a new one every time their child outgrows the last .
Argumentative	 this can be expensive .
Argumentative	 it has been reported that parents in south africa  , australia  , and the u.k  .
Argumentative	 have to pay a lot of money for their children 's school uniforms , and it is probably the same in other countries too .
Argumentative	 articleof the universal declaration of human rights states that `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ''  .
Argumentative	 children 's freedom of expression is restricted by school uniforms , because children who have to wear the same clothing as every other child in their school are not able to express their individuality and creativity .
Argumentative	 we should get rid of school uniform so that all children can express themselves freely .
