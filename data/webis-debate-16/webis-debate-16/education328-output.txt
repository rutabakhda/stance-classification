Non-Argumentative	the debate concerning the legitimacy of formal prayer in public schools channels two raging currents of american constitutional law - the regulation of education and the protection of religious liberty.
Non-Argumentative	 the republic was founded by emigrants from europe who sought to escape the bondage of laws which compelled their support and attendance at government sponsored churches.
Non-Argumentative	 accordingly, the first amendment of the constitution of the united states provides inter alia that: “congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”.
Non-Argumentative	 thus religious liberty receives the dual protection of the establishment clause, that demands the separation of government and governmental functions from religious doctrine, and the free exercise clause, that precludes government interference with the exercise of religion.
Non-Argumentative	 on behalf of the court, chief justice warren in brown v. board of education (‘brown i’)u.s. 483,s. ct.
Non-Argumentative	held that education is “perhaps the most important function of state and local governments”.
Non-Argumentative	 it is therefore unsurprising that the court has consistently struck down school prayer initiated by school officials as a violation of the establishment clause.
Non-Argumentative	 however, the strictness of scrutiny devoted to apparently innocuous religious practice remains remarkable.
Non-Argumentative	 the court has rejected non-denominational prayers as unconstitutional: engel v. vitaleu.
Non-Argumentative	s. 421,s. ct.
Non-Argumentative	 1261.
Non-Argumentative	 it has also found that non-sectarian prayers violate the establishment clause: lee v. weismanu.
Non-Argumentative	s. 577,s. ct.
Non-Argumentative	 2649.
Non-Argumentative	 the court has struck down an alabaman law authorizing schools to set aside one minute at the start of each day for meditation or voluntary prayer: wallace v. jaffreeu.
Non-Argumentative	s. 38,s. ct.
Non-Argumentative	 2479.
Non-Argumentative	 not even a high school program that empowered the student body to elect a student speaker who would precede varsity football games by delivering a short speech to “solemnize the event” survived the scrutiny of the justices: santa fe independent school district v. doeu.
Non-Argumentative	s. 290,s. ct.
Non-Argumentative	 2266.
Non-Argumentative	 given the prevailing jurisprudence, it is remarkably unlikely that public school prayer could be rendered constitutional in the united states at least in the foreseeable future.
Non-Argumentative	 nevertheless, no commentator would be advised to dismiss a debate that has captivated the most dynamic constitutional court in the world throughout the past century.
Non-Argumentative	this topic demands consideration of broad social and philosophical themes that include the proper extent to which a school should be paternalist; the separation of church and state; and role of the democratic imperative in education.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover, the circumstances of this debate are not limited to the school and judicial systems of the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedomsalso recognises “the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion” under article 9.
Non-Argumentative	 in the united kingdom, the relationship between religious liberty and public education has commonly attracted controversy in the context of faith-based schools whose admission policies are dependent upon proof of religious practice.
Non-Argumentative	 many of the arguments canvassed in this debate are cross-applicable to just such a discussion of religious schools.
Argumentative	 a pupil is unable to give or withhold their consent to participating in school prayer .
Argumentative	 this is because the school environment does not facilitate the free exercise of consent .
Argumentative	 it mandates attendance , it is delivered in an inherently instructional facility , and its subjects are immature , having underdeveloped faculties of resistance and consent , and being subject to the pressure of their peers .
Argumentative	 the supreme court in santa fe independent school district v. doe recognised the significance of social influence upon pupils exerted by colleagues and staff , and that in any school environment , a prayer will be seen as an approved action by the school which is unconstitutional .
Argumentative	 a pupil does not opt into the practice of prayer - the practice typically takes place in the context of an assembly at which attendance is compulsory .
Argumentative	 the consent of the pupil to the prayer is therefore not sought but merely presumed .
Argumentative	 religious discrimination is completely unacceptable and should certainly not be condoned or even facilitated by a school .
Argumentative	 yet , in order to be meaningful , a prayer must also be discriminatory between different religious beliefs .
Argumentative	 the imprecation of one deity , as opposed to another or several others , the choice of language and the supplication sought are distinctive to each faith .
Argumentative	 the incorporation of any or all such addresses into a single prayer at best confuses its meaning , and at worst renders it meaningless .
Argumentative	 where the practical precatory choice is between discrimination and equivocation no school prayer should be permitted .
Argumentative	 the court in pierce v. society of sisters and wisconsin v. yoder recognised that the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing of children under their control extends to the religious faith that is imparted to the children .
Argumentative	 the proper purpose of schooling is not indoctrination .
Argumentative	 should religion be considered a valuable part of a balanced curriculum , it ought to be taught in a broad and critical context in the classroom .
Argumentative	 a formal prayer instills obedience to a faith that the child might neither understand nor accept and to which the parent or guardian might properly object .
Argumentative	 the practice does not stimulate discussion or debate and therefore has no place in schools .
Argumentative	 if regulations were to change and prayers allowed based upon the expressed desires of students and parents , it would be almost impossible to ensure that each individual was receiving what they or their parents would consider the `` proper '' exposure to faith or religion .
Argumentative	 not only would it be logistically difficult and disruptive to allow students not to attend public prayers , it would also be very difficult to ensure that this was being done .
Argumentative	 only by ensuring that it is not allowed can this problem be solved -- that way those who do want to pray are of course still able to do so and those who do not want to be a part of it or whose parents do n't wish them to be involved may not be forced into doing so .
Argumentative	 evidence for this can actually be seen from an attempt to ensure that schools carry out prayer in wales where it is a legal obligation .
Argumentative	 the school standards and framework act  set out that every pupil `` shall on each school day take part in an act of collective worship . ''
Argumentative	 a bbc survey showed in fact that less than half of the schools inspected carried out this obligation - and equally if schools in america were permitted to conduct prayer , the level of continuity and the monitoring of whether or not the rights of the children under the constitution were being breached would be an impossible task .
