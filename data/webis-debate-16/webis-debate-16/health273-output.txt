Non-Argumentative	on march 23rd 2010, u.s. president barack obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act, an act the new york times calls “the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades”.
Non-Argumentative	the law’s purpose is to insuremillion more americans by expanding medicaid and introducing federal subsidies aimed at lower-income citizens to aid them in buying private health insurance.
Non-Argumentative	 it will also prohibit insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions, create a panel of experts to reduce government reimbursements under medicare and create incentives for better, bundled services.
Non-Argumentative	however, not all share this vision of the bill and the idea it stands for.
Non-Argumentative	 including the successful vote for repealing the legislation in the house, there have been numerous legal challenges launched against it, charging it with being unconstitutional, splitting judges’ in addition to politicians’ opinions down ideological lines.
Non-Argumentative	additionally, vermont has recently adopted legislature with the aim of introducing a single-payer form of healthcare, a system where a single provider, usually the government, by 2017, provides all the financing.
Non-Argumentative	with the legislature and the judiciary involved with their arguments, there weremillion uninsured americans in 2010,million new on account of unemployment, making the need for such a policy more necessary than ever.
Non-Argumentative	 yet on the other hand, the economic downturn shows no signs of abating, thus making the adoption of 930bn dollar bill a costly enterprise for the government and, therefore, for the average taxpayer.
Argumentative	 with universal health care , people are able to seek preventive treatment .
Argumentative	 this means having tests and check-ups before they feel ill , so that conditions can be picked up in their early stages when they are easy to treat .
Argumentative	 for example in a recent study% of women with health insurance knew their cholesterol level , while only% of uninsured women did .
Argumentative	 in the end , people who do not get preventive health care will get treatment only when their disease is more advanced .
Argumentative	 as a result their care will cost more and the outcomes are likely to be much worse .
Argumentative	 preventative care , made more accessible , can function the same way , reducing the costs further .
Argumentative	 in addition , a single-payer system reduces the administrative costs .
Argumentative	 a different way of charging for the care , not by individual services but by outcomes , as proposed by obama 's bill , also changes incentives from as many tests and procedures as possible to as many patients treated and healed as possible .
Argumentative	 we thus see that not only does universal health coverage inherently decrease costs because of preventative care , much of the cost can be avoided if implemented wisely and incentivized properly .
Argumentative	 american health insurance payments are very high and rising rapidly .
Argumentative	 even employer-subsidised programs are very expensive for many americans , because they often require co-payments or high deductibles , payment for the first part of any treatment .
Argumentative	 in any case employee health benefits are being withdrawn by many companies as a way of cutting costs .
Argumentative	 for those without insurance , a relatively minor illness or injury can be a financial disaster .
Argumentative	 it is unfair that many ordinary hard-working americans can no longer afford decent medical treatment .
Argumentative	 moving to a system of universal health care would reduce the burden on human resources personnel in companies .
Argumentative	 at present they must make sure the company is obeying the very many federal laws about the provision of health insurance .
Argumentative	 with a universal system where the government was the single-payer , these regulations would not apply and the costs of american businesses would be much reduced .
Argumentative	 the two crucial dimensions of the topic of introducing universal health care are morality and the affordability .
Argumentative	 paragraphof articleof the universal declaration of human rights states the following : `` everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family , including food , clothing , housing and medical care and necessary social services , and the right to security in the event of unemployment , sickness , disability , widowhood , old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control . ''
Argumentative	 analyzing the text , we see that medical care , in so far , as it provides adequate health and well-being is considered a human right by the international community .
Argumentative	 in addition , it also states , that this right extends also to periods of unemployment , sickness , disability , and so forth .
Argumentative	 despite this , why should we consider health care a human right ?
Argumentative	 because health is an essential prerequisite for a functional individual -- one that is capable of free expression for instance -- and a functional society -- one capable of holding elections , not hampered by communicable diseases , to point to just one example .
Argumentative	 universal health care provided by the state to all its citizens is the only form of health care that can provide what is outlined in the declaration .
Argumentative	 in the us the only conditions truly universally covered are medical emergencies .
Argumentative	 but life without the immediate danger of death hardly constitutes an adequate standard of health and well-being .
Argumentative	 additionally , programs such as medicaid and medicare do the same , yet again , only for certain parts of the population , not really providing the necessary care for the entire society .
Argumentative	 further , the current system of health care actively removes health insurance from the unemployed , since most ,% , of americans are insured through their employers -- thus not respecting the provision that demands care also in the case of unemployment .
Argumentative	 but does insurance equal health care ?
Argumentative	 in a word : yes .
Argumentative	 given the incredible cost of modern and sophisticated medical care -- a colonoscopy can cost more thandollars -- in practice , those who are not insured are also not treated .
