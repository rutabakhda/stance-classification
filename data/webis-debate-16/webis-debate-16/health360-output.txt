Non-Argumentative	in many countries, laws now exist which prevent people from smoking in public places, so that non-smokers can avoid breathing in secondhand smoke.
Non-Argumentative	 those who want a law preventing parents from smoking around their children (and punishing them if they do) see it as a natural and important next step; if we don’t let people smoke in public because they might endanger the lives of non-smokers around them, then it seems logical – say those in favour – to also have a law stopping parents from potentially harming their children through smoking in the home environment.
Non-Argumentative	  research has shown that second hand smoke is very bad for children’s health, and this is now widely accepted.
Non-Argumentative	  some medical experts believe it may be more dangerous than actual smoking because of the larger amount of cancer-causing chemicals in this type of smoke.
Non-Argumentative	  it can be especially harmful to babies and young children who are in the early stages of their physical development.
Non-Argumentative	 it may lead to less developed lungs and a series of respiratory (breathing) illnesses such as bronchitis, asthma and even heart conditions.
Non-Argumentative	  those in favour of this law see punishment (by escalating fines or maybe even imprisonment) as the best way to discourage parents from smoking around their children.
Argumentative	 children whose parents smoke in the home are exposed to secondhand smoke without any choice ; they ca n't just leave to avoid the smoky air .
Argumentative	 many studies have found a link between secondhand smoke exposure , through living or working with a smoker , and an increased risk of heart disease and lung cancer .
Argumentative	 the universal declaration of human rights states that `` everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family '' .
Argumentative	 because their respiration is hindered and their long term health is threatened , children who are being exposed to secondhand smoke against their will are therefore having their human rights infringed by their parents , and this properly subjects the parents to punishment .
Argumentative	 studies have found that children with parents who smoke are much more likely to use drugs , and especially more likely to smoke cigarettes themselves .
Argumentative	 children learn about the dangers of smoking and drugs in school , and know that it can damage health , but their parents are the most influential figures in their lives .
Argumentative	 if they see their parents , supposedly responsible adults , constantly doing something , then they are bound to think that it is okay for them to do it too .
Argumentative	 having a parent who smokes normalises smoking for the child , which is wrong .
Argumentative	 in order to prevent this from happening , it is necessary to make sure that parents do not smoke in front of their children by punishing them if they do .
Argumentative	 not being able to smoke in their home without risking punishment will make it much more difficult for parents to continue smoking , encouraging them to smoke much less or even give up altogether , which will improve their health .
Argumentative	 this can be seen in reports which show that there was a big decrease in the number of smokers in england after the ban on smoking in public places there , presumably because they did n't want to have to go outside all the time and be away from their friends every time they wanted to have a cigarette .
Argumentative	 similarly , many parents will give up smoking to avoid having to leave their children every time they want to have a cigarette or risk being punished .
Argumentative	 given the high compliance rates of the bans on smoking in public places in countries like scotland , it is reasonable to predict that people will be just as law-abiding with a law that protects children from secondhand smoke in their homes .
Argumentative	 part of the effect would deter parental smoking .
Argumentative	 they may not want to break the law and realize that it is a serious enough issue for children 's health that they should stop .
Argumentative	 furthermore , friends , relatives and others who care about the health and well-being of children could be trusted to ensure that those flouting the new law would be highlighted to police .
Argumentative	 other means of making enforcement workable would be to prohibit smoking in vehicles with children under age, violations observed by traffic police could be handled like other vehicle-related infractions .
Argumentative	 after providing ample advance notice of the new law 's start date , fines for violations in the home could be enforced , with each repeat violation receiving an increased fine .
