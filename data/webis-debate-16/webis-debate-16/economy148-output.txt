Non-Argumentative	the role of women in the family and the workplace has been an issue of great change and even greater implication throughout recent history.
Non-Argumentative	 changing social constructions of gender roles and family roles has led to a debate over the role of women in the home and the value or lack thereof placed upon it.
Non-Argumentative	 if the role of women is no longer always in the home should there be some compensation for those who do still agree to remain housewives (or very occasionally househusbands) in return for the work they do?
Non-Argumentative	 the debate over housewives being paid for their work is one of entitlement, economics and social engineering.
Non-Argumentative	  although this is a primarily a principled debate, one possible skeleton model for this case would be to propose that all housewives would be given equal salary from the government fund that is funded through tax payer dollars.
Non-Argumentative	 this would be carried out in the form of tax exemptions and tax rebates that would be doled out via the institutions and processes currently in place for tax returns, auditing etc. an example of this would be the internal revenue service in the united states or the canada revenue agency in canada.
Argumentative	 the philosophical basis of entitlement for pay is derived from the notion that if something comes into being as the product of an individual 's labor , then that individual is entitled to the profit and benefit of such a product because its existence was resultant of that individual 's labor .
Argumentative	 that in this case the labor is on services does not make any difference , the product of the housewife 's labor is that the children are looked after and domestic matters are all sorted .
Argumentative	 this is beneficial to society as housewives in addition to helping their own family are likely to have the time to help out others -- through volunteering , through looking after other 's children after school etc, it is estimated that the value of a housemaker 's services would be equivalent to approximately # 30,000 per year .
Argumentative	 in the same way that any product or service is created , offered or manufactured by individual workers , the services of home-keeping are delivered by the labor of the home-keeper .
Argumentative	 just as all workers are entitled to remuneration for the goods and services they create , so is a housewife is so entitled for the house-keeping services they offer .
Argumentative	 gender stereotypes dictate that the woman 's place is in the home and that that is an inferior position in the social hierarchy than that of the male 's corporate bread-winner status .
Argumentative	 the stereotype is particularly damaging to women 's expectations for themselves and the way society treats women .
Argumentative	 by paying housewives for their work , a greater emphasis is placed on the role of the home-keeper and on the women that tend to this job .
Argumentative	 it elevates the position of women in the household by economically empowering them and giving them the very thing that usually implies the greater importance of the bread-winners in the family , economic power and status .
Argumentative	 moreover , it elevates societal views of housewives and home-keepers by valuing their contributions to the household and society in a tangible , monetary way that society cares about .
Argumentative	 paying housewives for their work grants greater social status and power to women and family lives , which improves views of women and the roles they take in the family .
Argumentative	 one of the most important factors of oppression of women 's rights , particularly in the developing world , is dependence .
Argumentative	 women are often confined to the home by force , lack of opportunity or social stigma , on behalf of their husbands .
Argumentative	 when she is not paid , a housewife must rely on her husband for money , especially if she has children she is expected to take care of .
Argumentative	 economic empowerment allows further freedom for women in countries where women are confined to the home .
Argumentative	 by making women economic actors , you empower them to engage in different social structures and hold a stake and position in the centres of economic power .
Argumentative	 this is the most empowering tool one can offer women in most countries around the world .
Argumentative	 by paying housewives for their work , you offer one of the most powerful forms of social empowerment for women around the world .
