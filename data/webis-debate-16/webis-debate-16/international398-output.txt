Non-Argumentative	the model of the nation-state has traditionally provided the basis for international relations.
Non-Argumentative	 however, there are many problems which are impossible for individual nation-states to solve and which require international cooperation, for example environmental problems, third world poverty, international law, trading rules, etc. and cosmopolitanism is coming back into fashion; many people consider there to be such a thing as an international society with international laws.
Non-Argumentative	 this has serious implications for the old nation-state model and evokes the possibility of the united nations evolving into a popularly elected "world government".
Non-Argumentative	 should (and could) such a government exist?
Non-Argumentative	 ‘world government’ refers to the idea of all humankind united under one common political authority.
Non-Argumentative	 arguably, it has not existed so far in human history, yet proposals for a unified global political authority have existed since ancient times — in the ambition of kings, popes and emperors, and the dreams of poets and philosophers.
Non-Argumentative	note: there are many possible models that can be proposed when debating motions on world government.
Non-Argumentative	 each model yields a slightly different debate.
Non-Argumentative	 here is one option:the proposed world government would represent a qualitative advance over the united nations of today.
Non-Argumentative	 it would comprise legislative, executive and judicial branches; its high officials would be elected by its constituent population; and it would possess its own military force and powers of taxation.
Non-Argumentative	 it would be federal in form, so that the identity and institutions of its member nations would be fully preserved and protected.
Non-Argumentative	 the voting system in the world legislature would embody a balanced separation of powers so that neither the populous poorer nations of the world nor the less populous richer nations could impose their preferences on the other.
Non-Argumentative	 membership in the world federation would not be obligatory on all nations, and moreover, member nations could freely depart from the world federation at any time at their own unilateral discretion.
Non-Argumentative	 member nations could also retain control over whatever independent armed forces they feel essential to their national interests.
Non-Argumentative	 the expectation is that after a sufficiently lengthy period of gradual evolution, these retained rights of the member nations would become unimportant in a practical sense.
Argumentative	 as this happens, the world government would gradually become more authoritative and effective, while remaining democratic and benign.
Argumentative	ever since the destruction of the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki induring the closing days of world war ii , the threat of global devastation through nuclear world war has hung over human civilization like a damocles ' sword .
Argumentative	 the threat of global nuclear destruction peaked during the most perilous years of the cold war during the 1950s through the 1970s , and it gradually subsided thereafter .
Argumentative	 with the collapse of the soviet union in the early 1990s , many people came to believe that the threat has entirely disappeared .
Argumentative	 but this is false complacency .
Argumentative	 although national arsenals of nuclear-tipped icbms have declined in the two decades since the end of the cold war , they still exist at levels that would cause unimaginable death and destruction were they unleashed in a world war .
Argumentative	 the history of human civilization throughout the ages demonstrates the strong propensity among human beings toward hostility , violence and warfare -- whatever the potential cost .
Argumentative	 as long as the international political system is based upon the sovereignty of nation-states , the threat of nuclear world war will always be there .
Argumentative	 economic interaction among the nations of the world , in the form of trade , investment and migration , has reached such a point today that it is meaningful to think of `` the world economy . ''
Argumentative	 economic globalization suggests the need for political globalization in the form of a world government .
Argumentative	 following the seminal work of john maynard keynes during the great depression of the 1930s , it has become widely accepted within the economics profession that a certain amount of interventionist national government policy is essential to maintaining a proper balance between the twin economic evils of unemployment and inflation .
Argumentative	 just as judicious national anticyclical policy is beneficial to national economies , so too a judicious world anticyclical policy , as implemented by a functioning world government , would be beneficial to the world economy .
Argumentative	 a world government would also improve the overall functioning of the global economy by means of regularizing various circumstances of international economic interaction , for example , in the area of patents and copyrights , and by working to reduce various trade impediments , such as tariffs and quotas , imposed by national governments .
Argumentative	 a world government would enhance the probability that effective means will be developed and implemented toward ameliorating the global problems of resource depletion and environmental decay .
Argumentative	 in a world divided into a host of jealously independent and self-righteously sovereign nations , national leaders tend to point the finger of blame for these problems at other nations , and to resist international efforts toward resource conservation and environmental preservation .
Argumentative	 as the mutual accusations and recriminations go on and on , the problems are left to fester .
Argumentative	 if a world government existed , it might muster sufficient respect and possess sufficient authority to enable the nations to arrive at a workable consensus on how to share equitably the short-term costs and inconveniences necessary to securing long-term sustainability of resources and preservation of environmental quality .
Argumentative	 a world government would give people a higher focus for their political loyalties than their respective nation-states , and thus facilitate the development of a higher degree of cosmopolitanism than is possible under the sovereign nation-state system .
Argumentative	 this would benefit the practical operations and effectiveness of the world government .
Argumentative	 the greater the sense of community among the citizens of a polity , the higher the effectiveness of the polity 's government , and the higher the effectiveness of the polity 's government , the greater the sense of community among its citizens .
Argumentative	 this suggests an interactive , snowballing relationship over time between the sense of community of the citizens of the world federation , and the efficiency and effectiveness of its practical operations .
Argumentative	 from relatively low sense of community and low effectiveness in its early stages , over many years of gradual evolution , the world federation would eventually achieve a very high level of community spirit and practical effectiveness .
Argumentative	 the history of the european union , eu , in the post-world war ii era provides an encouraging example of what might be done at the global level through a functioning world government .
Argumentative	 it is widely agreed among economists that the relatively high degree of prosperity and security enjoyed today by the people of the western european nations is in no small measure the result of the gradual evolution from the original limited-purpose , six-member european coal and steel community , ecsc , to the general-purpose , 27-member eu of today .
Argumentative	 in the early 1940s , many of the eu nations of today were locked in devastating warfare .
Argumentative	 the fact that these same nations are today harmonious components of a quasi-state polity demonstrates the capability of people to change their customary modes of thought and behavior when there exists a sufficient incentive to do so .
