Non-Argumentative	the last few years have seen a renewed enthusiasm for atheism and secularism in much of the world and debates between believers and non-believers have become ever more vigorous.
Non-Argumentative	 one distinction that is frequently made, particularly by theists, is that between faith and religion.
Non-Argumentative	 whether such a distinction is meaningful or relevant does not fall within the purview of this debate, which focusses entirely on religion in the ordinary meaning of the word.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition it will focus primarily on the abrahamic religions (christianity, islam and judaism) purely on the basis that they represent the largest of the world’s religious traditions.
Non-Argumentative	debates on religious issues are notoriously challenging because the burdens of proof can vary hugely and the term covers so many traditions and so many exceptions- that there always seems to be a counterfactual available to any evidence-based argument.
Non-Argumentative	 take, for example, the well publicised and widely discussed roman catholic prohibition on contraception.
Non-Argumentative	 from a purely secular perspective, the decision makes no medical sense.
Non-Argumentative	 however, from a religious standpoint it encourages abstinence and faithfulness, which are seen as valuable normative goals in and of themselves.
Non-Argumentative	it would be wrong to ignore the fact that debates on religious issues also have a tendency to be heated and, in the case of public debates, can be frustrating because of the reluctance of anyone in the room to criticise their own views.
Non-Argumentative	 however, precisely because of these factors, discussions on the value of religion for excellent training and competitive debate topics.
Non-Argumentative	 debates on religion compel speakers and adjudicators not only to question their own views but to focus on the structure of arguments themselves, rather than relying on frameworks of assumed knowledge, as can often be the case in political debates.
Non-Argumentative	usually, debates on this motion run along the lines of the impact of religious organizations on various moral issues and the groups affected by them.
Non-Argumentative	 abortion, gay marriage, women’s rights and others tend to come up.
Non-Argumentative	 a common theme also tends to be the extent to which organisations are responsible for the actions of individuals who profess that particular faith.
Non-Argumentative	 there is a frequent claim that religions- or the organisations that represent them- get to pick and choose.
Non-Argumentative	 as a result, the argument goes, islam is not responsible for terrorist atrocities nor is the catholic church culpable for child sex abuse.
Non-Argumentative	 it’s an interesting distinction and one that is likely to exercise both sides of the debate.
Non-Argumentative	efforts to play the same argument the other way around against secularism do not really work, as it is difficult to find an instance of acts comparable to religiously sponsored intolerance being committed as a direct result of the actions of secularism.
Non-Argumentative	 opposition teams often resort to the use of examples that break goodwin’s law.
Non-Argumentative	 a desperate opposition team may discuss that securalist or atheist tendencies of hitler and stalin – although rarely to any effect.
Non-Argumentative	ultimately this is a debate that is all about defining the parameters of discussion.
Argumentative	 it is all too easy for it to degenerate into general assertions about charity and bigotry and yet there is plenty of fact on both sides.
Argumentative	it is a basic tenant of all religions that they divide humanity into ` us ' and ` them ' -- believers and non-believers .
Argumentative	 however , the divisions of society perceived by religious believers do not stop there , and have a tendency to reflect the social and moral views of an earlier and far less progressive age .
Argumentative	 as well as condemning those who practice other faiths , or who choose to follow no faith , they have fought , and continued to fight , the expansion of the rights of women and of socially marginalised castes , among other social groups .
Argumentative	 all of the major churches and sects have had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world , and most of them are still desperately trying to ignore the existence of modernity .
Argumentative	 while justifying their political and moral positions through obtuse and deliberately obscure interpretations of religious texts , obscure texts even the mainstream interpretations of major religions are usually sexist , frequently racist and almost universally homophobic .
Argumentative	 preventing access to contraception is the single largest block to women getting out of poverty .
Argumentative	 there are many other examples of the excesses and double standards of mainstream religion -- too many examples to pick one .
Argumentative	 particularly in the case of contemporary islam , although other historical examples could be referred to , the combination of certainty and the promise of life after death is a sure route towards violence .
Argumentative	 that said , catholics and protestants in northern ireland demonstrated this until recently ; the yugoslav wars between catholics , orthodox and muslims , both sides of the battle for israel/palestine and many others in history could also be thrown into the mix .
Argumentative	 allowing people the opportunity to claim that `` god 's on our side '' can be used to justify anything , especially when he appears to be fighting on both sides .
Argumentative	 although in much of the world the days of the crusades and the inquisition may be gone , there are plenty of nations were religious disobedience still is still punished harshly , summarily or extra-judicially .
Argumentative	 in other countries , semi-official militias are left to enforce the minutiae of religious law , although usually in such a way as to disadvantage women and others already persecuted in society .
Argumentative	 it should be noted that what tends to be the focus of such persecution is a lack of adherence to an ultra-orthodox position .
Argumentative	 it is frequently a cover for political or social prejudice .
Argumentative	 charges of heresy or apostasy are easy to level and nigh on impossible to disprove .
Argumentative	 even beyond these extremes , demands for religious observance play out in us elections and , inexplicably , the views of religious leaders are sought on areas where they really have no relevant expertise at all , such as advances in medical progress .
Argumentative	 those who disagree on matters such as stem cell research or gay rights are , apparently , arguing with the almighty .
