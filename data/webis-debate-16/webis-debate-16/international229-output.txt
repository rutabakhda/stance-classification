Non-Argumentative	a standing army is a permanent military force, entirely under the command of a single authority.
Non-Argumentative	 this is almost always a national government, although in the past european colonial companies sometimes maintained their own private military forces, as did feudal barons and warlords (for example, in china in the 1920s).
Non-Argumentative	 at present the un has no military force of its own to send on peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions.
Non-Argumentative	 instead, it has to gather together troops and equipment volunteered by member states on an ad hoc basis for each individual crisis.
Non-Argumentative	a un standing army  would be under the control of the unsc; if individual states could pull troops out of it when they chose to (for example because they disagreed with the objective of a particular mission), then it would not fulfil the true definition of a standing army.
Non-Argumentative	 there are significant practical issues to be considered: how large the force would be?
Non-Argumentative	 what military capabilities it would have (e.g. would it have air and sea power?)
Non-Argumentative	?
Non-Argumentative	 how it would be recruited?
Non-Argumentative	 how it would be funded and where it might be based.
Non-Argumentative	?
Non-Argumentative	 to what extent it would add to or replace the existing methods of raising troops should also be considered?
Non-Argumentative	 long term peacekeeping missions (for example, in cyprus or bosnia) might still be undertaken by detachments volunteered by individual states, while the un standing army might be deployed to deal with short-term crises.
Argumentative	 a strong , effective and impartial united nations standing army would deny powerful military states the right to bully and blackmail rivals into submission with the threat of military force .
Argumentative	 a un army would be able to balance that threat with their own willingness to come to the aid of states under military duress .
Argumentative	 the united states , unwilling to risk a protracted conflict against a respected , well-trained multi-national force would have to fall back .
Argumentative	 to use an example , american military intervention in vietnam , against the wishes of the majority of the population , could have been prevented had a u.n. standing army existed to respond to the wishes of the vietnamese people and stand against the united states ' intervention .
Argumentative	 the existence of such a military rival would therefore force the united states to increase its investment in its state department and diplomatic solutions to political crises .
Argumentative	 ultimately , peace would be more effectively maintained .
Argumentative	 changes in modern warfare dictate the need for an impartial , rapidly-deploying , multi-national force .
Argumentative	 modern warfare is no longer the trench battles of battalions aligned to a flag , it is increasingly police actions designed to prevent the resort to warfare in the first place or enforce ceasefires once they have begun .
Argumentative	 as such , the impartiality of a un standing army would be highly valuable , offering both parties in the conflict a neutral peacemaker and peacekeeper .
Argumentative	 contrast this to the perceived differences in attitude between troops from britain , the us , russia and france to warring sides in the balkans .
Argumentative	 it would be free of accusations of meddling and self-interest that accompany the participation of troops from neighbouring states in un interventions , for example , nigeria in west african missions .
Argumentative	 a un standing army could overcome local civilian suspicion , free from the threat of propaganda from those opposed to it and free from the restraints of state power on those troops involved .
Argumentative	 furthermore , a un standing army would be able to deploy much faster than current peacekeeping missions which are held back by the bureaucracy of finding troops , equipment and funding .
Argumentative	 the present system takes months to put forces in the field , and these are often inadequate to the task in hand , as member states have pledged fewer troops than were requested and they then struggle to co-ordinate across cultural and linguistic barriers .
Argumentative	 this has meant the un has often acted too late , with too little force , and has thereby failed to avert humanitarian disasters in such places as central africa , bosnia , sierra leone and somalia .
Argumentative	 a un standing army would be permanently available and able to deploy rapidly to contain crises before they turn into full-scale wars and humanitarian disasters .
Argumentative	 without an independent army , the un has ` no capacity to avert such catastrophes 'for it simply can not raise forces quickly or effectively enough .

Argumentative	 a un standing army would be more effective than the variety of troops staffing missions under the current system .
Argumentative	 at present most un operations are supplied by developing nations who hope to make a profit from the payments they receive for their services , but who are under-equipped and badly trained .
Argumentative	 forces from the major powers are provided sparingly and only after substantial public pressure or when there exists an incentive for their use .
Argumentative	 a un standing army would be better prepared , both in regards to training and equipment , and its soldiers would have greater motivation as they would have made a choice to enlist , rather than being conscripts forced by their own states to fight someone else 's war .
Argumentative	 a single un force would also have better command and control than in current situations , when different national forces and their commanders often fail to work effectively together in the field for cultural and linguistic reasons .
Argumentative	 successful forces such as the french foreign legion , the indian army and the roman army show that issues of language and culture need not be problems in combat situations .
Argumentative	 they can be overcome through a strong professional ethos and a commitment to a mutual cause , values that can only be expected to develop if troops prepare , train and fight together .
