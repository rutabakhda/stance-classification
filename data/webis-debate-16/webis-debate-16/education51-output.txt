Non-Argumentative	this discussion starts from the point of view that sexual education classes should be given at schools.
Non-Argumentative	 but does this mean that so-called “safe sex” should also be promoted within these lessons?
Non-Argumentative	 safe sex is the practice of sexual activity in a manner that reduces the risk of infection with sexually transmitted diseases (stds) such as chlamydia and hiv/aids, typically by use of condoms.
Non-Argumentative	 safe sex also includes sexual practices that do not involve penetration.
Non-Argumentative	traditionally sexual education lessons have focused on covering the biological facts about human reproduction, and warnings against unsafe sexual practices.
Non-Argumentative	 often today sex education is combined with relationships education, in an attempt to place sex in a broader emotional, social and family context.
Non-Argumentative	 but now every day more and more people talk about “safe sex” and how teenagers should be more informed about protection against stds.
Non-Argumentative	despite the worries some people have about whether sex should ever be seen as entirely risk-free, every day this so-called "safe sex" is promoted more and more as a solution for the epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases amongst teenagers.
Non-Argumentative	 but what if the promotion of "safe sex" has the opposite effect for which it was introduced in sexual education classes?
Non-Argumentative	  inthe proportion of british 16-19 year olds who had had unprotected sex rose to 26% and 45% did not consider themselves to be well informed about contraception.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents argue that today sexual education and promoting safe sex are mostly considered the same thing, while it isn't and shouldn't be.
Non-Argumentative	 they say it is one thing to inform teenagers about sex and its risks, and quite another to promote and encourage them to use "safe sex" as prevention.
Non-Argumentative	other issues include whether parents should have the ability to ‘opt-out’ of sex education for their children – or indeed whether the children themselves should be able to opt-out; whether or not sex education should be done with a particular focus (such as promotion of abstinence); and whether or not faith schools should be compelled to teach elements of a sex-education syllabus (such as on homosexual relationships) which run contrary to their beliefs.
Argumentative	 the spread of aids in the 80s and 90s showed that education and information is more important than ever as exemplified by the slogan in the british's advertising campaign to prevent aids ` aids : do n't die of ignorance ' .
Argumentative	 the campaigns were credited with credited with changing behaviour through warnings on adverts and informing through an information leaflet .
Argumentative	 this shows that education can work even when starting from scratch .
Argumentative	 giving sex education in schools is crucial to the spread of information to each successive generation , and may be supplemented by frank discussion at home .
Argumentative	 young people express their sexuality as part of their development to adulthood .
Argumentative	 it is not having sex that is a problem , but having unsafe sex or hurting people through sexual choices .
Argumentative	 refusing to promote safe sex would mean not moving with the times .
Argumentative	 just because schools do not promote safe sex does not mean that adolescents will not experiment with sex .
Argumentative	 they will already be exposed to sexual imagery and ideas of sex so it is necessary that they are taught properly how to remain safe .
Argumentative	 schools may also want to talk about abstinence at the same time ; it is a way of keeping sexually safe .
Argumentative	 however schools have to recognise that the majority of pupils are unlikely to stick to abstinence regardless of how much the school promotes it .
Argumentative	 it is therefore necessary for the school to also promote and educate about safe sex .
Argumentative	 the internet provides a vast amount of easily accessible information about sex , of varying degrees of quality .
Argumentative	 most children in the west now have access to the internet and are therefore likely to have access to this information on sex , or at least educational materials on sex even if the child 's access to the internet is controlled .
Argumentative	 given that it is impossible to prevent children from accessing this information if they really want to , it makes sense to present it to them in an organised and accurate fashion .
Argumentative	 rather than allowing children to find information on their own through what may well be unreliable resources it is necessary that they should get good reliable information .
Argumentative	 that this information when there is safe sex education comes from the school means that the children know that they information is reliable .
Argumentative	 they can then use this information to help them decide how reliable any further information they may find from other sources is .
Argumentative	 with the age of consent beingand with young people being able to vote at, it does not make sense for parents to have control over whether their children attended sex education classes right up until the age ofor whenever they finish full time schooling .
Argumentative	 the age of consent means that there is clearly a need to be taught about sex from that age of consent .
Argumentative	 this is something that can not be guaranteed to happen in all individual households if left to the parents whereas it can be ensured in schools .
