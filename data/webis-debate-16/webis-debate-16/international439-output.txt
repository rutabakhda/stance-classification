Non-Argumentative	both the usa and the european union have bans on arms sales to china.
Non-Argumentative	 these were put in place in 1989, as part of the international reaction to the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square.
Non-Argumentative	 in the sixteen years since the ban was imposed, china has experienced rapid growth and has become a very important part of the global economy, both importing and exporting goods worth many billions of dollars a year.
Non-Argumentative	 it has also opened up to foreign investment and, as a recent member of the world trade organisation, is committed to further opening.
Non-Argumentative	 over the same period, china has also become more active diplomatically, participating more in global and regional bodies such as the united nations.
Non-Argumentative	 the chinese leadership has called this increasing engagement china's "peaceful rise", although other nations worry about continuing territorial claims affecting relations with most of china's neighbours, as well as pressures from growing popular nationalism.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states in particular is concerned about china's claim on taiwan, which is regarded as a break-away province by the mainland, but which enjoys an unspoken promise of american support in case of an unprovoked chinese invasion.
Non-Argumentative	 in recent years china has spent a great deal on modernising its armed forces, buying advanced military equipment from russia in particular, and much of this build-up appears to be designed to enable china to project its power outside its own borders.
Non-Argumentative	as china has become more important on the world stage, and a very important trading partner for europe, it has lobbied hard for the eu arms ban to be lifted (australia's similar ban was lifted in 1992, but there is no prospect of the united states doing so).
Non-Argumentative	 france in particular has argued within the eu for removing the ban, pointing out that acode of conduct on weapons sales would ensure that european military technology did not flood into china.
Non-Argumentative	 this position appeared to have widespread support from member states, including germany, italy and (at times) the u.k, although the european parliament and public opinion in most member states remained strongly against change.
Non-Argumentative	 it looked likely the ban would be repealed in mid-2005 but plans were put aside after strong american pressure and concern about china's attitude to taiwan.
Argumentative	 nonetheless, the issue appears likely to return and will remain controversial.
Argumentative	europe has a developing strategic partnership with china .
Argumentative	 china is europe 's largest trading partner with eu exports in goods of $ 113.1 billiion and imports of $ 281.9 billion and in services of $ 20.2 billion and $ 16.3 billion respectively , and as china 's rapid growth continues it is playing an increasingly important part in the global economy and in international affairs .
Argumentative	 clearly it is in the eu 's interests to work together with this emerging superpower .
Argumentative	 ma zhaoxu a foreign ministry spokesman called it ` the obstacle to the sound growth of the china-eu relationship , ' after more than fifteen years , it is time to lift it .
Argumentative	 china has repeatedly said that it will never enjoy a normal trading relationship with the eu until the ban is lifted .
Argumentative	 europe 's first responsibility is to its own citizens economic wellbeing which would benefit from greater trade ties between china and the european union .
Argumentative	 china has changed over the past two decades , becoming more open to the world and more open domestically .
Argumentative	 for example it is experimenting with democratic elections at village level and sincebegun extending these to townships .
Argumentative	 it has also effectively scrapped the repressive one-child policy .
Argumentative	 internationally china is a responsible member of the international community , as befits a permanent member of the un security council .
Argumentative	 at the united nations , although it occasionally abstains from votes , it very rarely threatens to use its veto power in the security council , it has only used the veto six times sincewhen the prc joined the un - unlike the usa , for example .
Argumentative	 its `` peaceful rise '' can also be seen in its hosting of the six-nation talks over north korea 's nuclear programme .
Argumentative	 and china is increasingly willing to operate within regional diplomatic frameworks covering east asia , se asia and central asia .
Argumentative	 in a global marketplace , if eu states do n't sell china arms , others will .
Argumentative	 russia and israel already sell china much high-tech military material , betweenandrussia sold over $ 16billion of arms to china .
Argumentative	 as israel is a key american ally , us criticism of europe over lifting this ban is particularly unfair .
Argumentative	 it is in europe 's economic interest to gain part of the huge chinese market and so safeguard european jobs .
Argumentative	 and if european arms industries can not find export markets , their production for domestic military forces is simply not enough to support the cost of research and development , so our indigenous arms sector may collapse .
Argumentative	 cooperating with china is the best way to gain influence with the regime in order to promote democracy and human rights , engage it internationally , etc, the chinese respond very badly to being publicly lectured or threatened , but they will listen to those friendly nations who have earned their trust in ways like these .
Argumentative	 china for example often follows russia , since the beginning of the 1990s its biggest arms supplier , when it comes to voting in the united nations security council .
Argumentative	 thus both vetoed sanctions against syria inand shortly after russia shifted its position to urging assad to carry out reforms china followed .
Argumentative	 the influence of the united states over other east asian states in encouraging their democratization also shows that friends can apply influence on issues such as human rights as well as where interests coincide ; the united states played a key role in sheparding philippine dictator marcos out of office and then encouraged korean president chun doo hwan to stick to a single term of office and not to use force against the opposition in.
Argumentative	 lifting the ban is an investment in the future of the europe-china relationship , and could be of benefit to the whole world , not just the eu .
Argumentative	 the current arms ban is purely symbolic .
Argumentative	 china is already able to buy a range of military items from europe , $million worth in, and the usa , which has a similar `` ban '' on weapons sales to china .
Argumentative	 this is because the eu 's current ban is not legally binding and it is up to each eu member to define and implement the embargo meaning the embargo is not effective .
Argumentative	 an arms ban is therefore a blunt instrument that does not work .
Argumentative	 instead future sales should be regulated by a tough eu code of conduct which prevents military equipment being sold to any state which might use it for external aggression or internal repression .
Argumentative	 such a code of conduct for all arms exports has already existed since.
Argumentative	 such a code of conduct will be a much better guarantee that china is not sold arms unless eu states are sure they will not be misused .
