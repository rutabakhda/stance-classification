Non-Argumentative	nato, the north atlantic treaty organisation, is a military alliance based on the north atlantic treaty.
Non-Argumentative	 it was founded inby twelve allied countries including the united states, the united kingdom, canada and france, originally with the intention to provide collective security for europe against the soviet-led communist bloc.
Non-Argumentative	 in response, the soviet union formed the warsaw pact in 1955, a rival collective security organisation led by the soviet union.
Non-Argumentative	when the soviet union collapsed, the warsaw pact disintegrated, but nato continued existing.
Non-Argumentative	 in fact, inand 2004, it expanded with many new members who originally were a member of that same rival warsaw pact, including poland (1999) and the baltic countries (estonia, latvia, lithuania, 2004).
Non-Argumentative	through membership of nato, all member countries commit themselves to ‘mutual defense’.
Non-Argumentative	 this means that all member states commit to assist another member when it comes under attack.
Non-Argumentative	 formally, this assistance isn’t necessarily military, but in practice it is assumed it means military assistance.
Non-Argumentative	 this idea of ‘an attack against one is an attack against all’ under nato was invoked only once, after the attacks of september 11,on the u.s.the members of nato hold regular military exercises together, with the aim to improve coordination and cooperation between their respective militaries.
Non-Argumentative	 nato also issues so-called stanags (standardized agreements) which harmonize rules, procedures and equipment of the militaries of all members.
Non-Argumentative	next to that, nato also runs the membership actions plans (map).
Non-Argumentative	 countries can request to receive a map, which is a plan to put them on course to eventually joining nato as a full member.
Non-Argumentative	 bosnia & herzegovina, macedonia and montenegro all have maps.
Non-Argumentative	 georgia has expressed interest for a map and ukraine expressed interest until 2010.
Argumentative	  originally , nato had a clearly defined purpose and a common enemy : the soviet bloc .
Argumentative	 with the demise of that shared enemy , nato 's original purpose has disappeared but its well-functioning military structure remained , leaving it open to be seized by opportunistic politicians in a classic case of ` scope creep ' .
Argumentative	 this has happened with u.s. president george bush jr. 's push to let ukraine and georgia in as new members in his global campaign to spread democracy .
Argumentative	 this has only served to increase tensions with russia , see next argument .
Argumentative	 who is to say that something similar is n't going to happen vis-à-vis china ?
Argumentative	 there are two issues keeping russia cautious of nato as a military alliance .
Argumentative	 the first is a proposal by the u.s. to put up a missile defence system in poland , the czech republic and on warships in the black sea under the flag of nato to protect against missiles from iran or north korea , which , according to russia , would never fly over these countries in any attack .
Argumentative	 russia concludes that the missile defence system therefore must be directed at them .
Argumentative	 the second issue is nato 's plans to expand with ukraine and georgia , which russia has traditionally regarded as part of their ` sphere of influence ' .
Argumentative	 as russian president medvedev stated in: `` no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . ''
Argumentative	 the clause that ` an attack against one means an attack against all ' , article v , runs the risk of entangling the entire alliance in an unwanted conflict .
Argumentative	 this has happened before : world war i started out as a local conflict between the austro-hungarian empire and serbia , but through their security alliances inadvertently drew in all the major powers of the world .
Argumentative	 given that many members of nato have unstable countries near their borders , i.e. turkey bordering iraq , there is a risk they could become involved in a small regional war , which then inadvertently draws in the entire world .
Argumentative	 maintaining an administration for nato , with personnel and buildings , costs money .
Argumentative	 moreover , whenever nato-members engage in a mission , they 're supposed to fund their activities under these missions themselves .
Argumentative	 given that the original threat has passed and given that the organisation still struggles to redefine itself , why spend money on it ?
