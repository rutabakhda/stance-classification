Non-Argumentative	truth and reconciliation commissions use the principles of restorative justice and alternative dispute resolution to help post conflict states recover from pasts characterised by politically motivated crimes and human rights abuses.
Non-Argumentative	the best known contemporary example of this process is the truth and reconciliation commission that operated in south africa betweenand 1998.
Non-Argumentative	 under the chairmanship of archbishop desmond tutu, individuals involved in the violence surround the apartheid regime were invited to confess what they had done.
Non-Argumentative	 the commission addressed violent acts, human rights violations and politically motivated crimes committed by individuals on both sides of the conflict between the south african state and the liberation movement.
Non-Argumentative	 surviving victims and the relatives of dead victims were also given an opportunity to tell their story.
Non-Argumentative	 those who told what they did under apartheid were granted freedom from prosecution for their crimes (providing the commission agreed that they were politically motivated); those who refused to testify remain liable to criminal prosecution.
Non-Argumentative	although south africa is the best known example of such a commission, others preceded it, particularly in post-dictatorship situations in latin america (e.g. argentina, bolivia, chile, guatemala, el salvador) and africa (e.g. nigeria, ghana).
Non-Argumentative	 in many of these cases the commission's main task was truth-finding, but national reconciliation was usually at least part of the motivation behind setting them up.
Argumentative	  countries emerging from violent pasts , involving repression , civil war and political violence may attempt to come to terms with their histories in three ways .
Argumentative	 firstly , they can attempt to ignore the past , allowing those guilty of atrocities to go unpunished and perhaps even prosper under the new system .
Argumentative	 this approach leaves victims ' families bitter and communities divided , entrenching resentments and potentially distorted accounts of individuals ' involvement in violent activities .
Argumentative	 such a situation makes renewed violence all the more likely .
Argumentative	 secondly , post conflict states can set up war crimes courts , as in the balkans , rwanda and sierra leone , but these may be seen as victor 's justice , or as an imposition by a distant opaque international body .
Argumentative	 those threatened by such courts may refuse to lay down their arms , jeopardising any chance of a lasting peace settlement - as with joseph kony 's long-running rebellion in northern uganda .
Argumentative	 finally and often best , they can set up a form of truth and reconciliation commission .
Argumentative	 this requires the whole country to face up to its past , to acknowledge that violence was done by all parties and that the victims were many , and to seek reconciliation through forgiveness at both personal and national levels .
