Non-Argumentative	the yasukuni shrine was established as the tōkyō shōkonsha inand renamed yasukuni shrine in 1879.
Non-Argumentative	 this was immediately after the boshin war – a conflict between supporters of the shōgunate and those who wanted to restore the emperor to political power – the emperor meiji ordered the construction of the shrine to honor those who had died for their country during this war.
Non-Argumentative	“i assure those of you who fought and died for your country that your names will live forever at this shrine in musashino” so reads a poem composed by the emperor meiji for the shrine demonstrating the purpose of the shrine to honor those who have fought and died for japan.
Non-Argumentative	 in this the yasukuni is not too dissimilar from other national cemeteries around the world.
Non-Argumentative	  arlington national cemetery in the united states’ mission is “on behalf of the american people, lay to rest those who have served our nation with dignity and honor.”
Non-Argumentative	 this is very similar to meiji’s poem.
Non-Argumentative	 daejeon national cemetery in south korea’s introduction message says “daejeon national cemetery is the sacred place in which those who sacrificed themselves to protect and defend our people and nation are buried in peaceful rest”.
Non-Argumentative	where the yasukuni is different is in the controversy surrounding it.
Non-Argumentative	 there are 2,466,000 souls enshrined at the shrine and almost all of these are military.
Non-Argumentative	 they are from those who died during wars fought by japan from the bonshin war through to the second world war.
Non-Argumentative	 however most of these conflicts (with the exception of the bonshin war and the satsuma rebellion) were wars of aggression.
Non-Argumentative	most controversial however is the enshrinement of war criminals.
Non-Argumentative	 at the end of world war ii the victorious allies instituted the international military tribunal for the far east, otherwise known as the tokyo trials, to try those japanese who had played large roles in planning the war or had allowed criminal acts to take place.
Non-Argumentative	 there were more thanjapanese charged with war crimes.
Non-Argumentative	of these are enshrined at yasukuni.
Non-Argumentative	 fourteen of the enshrined are class a criminals, including the hideki tōjō prime minister during world war ii, who were convicted of crimes against peace “namely, planning, preparation, initiation, or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing”.
Non-Argumentative	not all japanese recognise that these people were war criminals with a phamphlet at yasukuni having stated “some 1,068 people, who were wrongly accused as war criminals by the allied court, were enshrined here”.
Non-Argumentative	 many japanese consider the courts to be victor’s justice.
Non-Argumentative	 there is therefore a conflict as a result of a minority in japan who believe they should honor their dead in yasukuni and essentially deny that the problem of war criminals exists.
Non-Argumentative	yasukuni is has only quite recently become a political controversy.
Non-Argumentative	 during theyears fromto koizumi becoming prime minister there were only visits on four occasions by prime ministers, with only one of them an official visit.
Non-Argumentative	 prime minister koizumi visited every year he was in office but prime ministers have not visited since.
Non-Argumentative	 despite this controversy had continued as cabinet ministers continue to visit, the prime minister has sometimes sent an aide with an offering in his stead as abe did onaugust 2013, and each visit by any cabinet minister sparks protest and outrage from japan’s neighbours.
Non-Argumentative	a related lesser controversy is that some of the 27,863 taiwanese andkoreans who are enshrined at yasukuni are there against the wishes of the deceased’s families leading to accusations that they have in effect been kidnapped in death.
Non-Argumentative	p.s. this might be better with the motion switched around to be ‘this house would not visit the yasukuni shrine’ because the status quo is that politicians, including senior ones, visit almost every year.
Non-Argumentative	 however i believe that making motions negative adds an element of confusion making it more difficult to follow.
Argumentative	 the arguments would be the same anyway, simply reversed.
Argumentative	every nation should be allowed to honor its war dead how it wishes .
Argumentative	 wars are horrifying times and atrocities are almost always committed by all sides .
Argumentative	 japan 's actions in its wars , particularly the second world war were particularly brutal but this should not mean that japans leaders should be banned from paying their respects to their ancestors who died fighting for their country .
Argumentative	 most nations do this in one way or another .
Argumentative	 the difference is that yasukuni has those who were convicted criminals enshrined but others also honor those who have committed acts that might be considered criminal .
Argumentative	 perhaps the most extreme example is the mausoleum of mao zedong right at the heart of beijing where there are still big celebrations to mark his birthday -- unlike shintoism in japan maoism is still very much part of the ideology of the state .
Argumentative	 everyone is entitled to freedom of religion and that applies to the japanese as much as any other peoples .
Argumentative	 yasukuni is a shrine in the shinto religion -- equivalent to a church - and was the center of state shinto through the first half of the twentieth century .
Argumentative	 refusing to allow japanese ministers to visit the shrine might therefore be said to be similar to barring british politicians from westminster abbey because there is a memorial stone to oliver cromwell there and as a result it could be interpreted as offensive to the irish -- westminister abbey 's page notably avoids mentioning the wexford and drogheda massacres that are remembered by the irish .
Argumentative	 the vast majority of members of the government when visiting yasukuni do so only in a private capacity and not as representatives of the government .
Argumentative	 as private individuals in their own lives anyone should be allowed to visits any such sites they wish .
Argumentative	 minister keiji furuya argues `` paying homage to the war dead is a purely domestic matter and it 's not for other countries to criticize us or intervene in these matters '' and prime minister abe agrees that it should not be a diplomatic issue `` as for when i might go to yasukuni shrine , or whether i will go or not , i will not say as this should not become a political or diplomatic issue '' .
Argumentative	 that there has been controversy and criticism even when it clearly is a domestic private matter , such as former republic of china , taiwan , president lee teng-hui visiting the grave of his elder brother inshows that critics , in this case the people 's republic of china , are simply interested in finding an opportunity to attack the japanese government .
