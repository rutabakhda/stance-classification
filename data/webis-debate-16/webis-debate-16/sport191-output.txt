Non-Argumentative	 however, on wednesday 4th may, the guardian newspaper reported that fifa is set to consider the possibility of introducing goal-line technology in time for the 2012-13 season.1 it is not the first time fifa has requested that companies undergo a formal testing procedure but there is one key difference this time: they will be permitted to do so at a stadium of their own choosing.
Non-Argumentative	 previously, every one of the dozen or so companies who underwent the tests at fifa house had fallen foul of the short set-up time and unrealistic conditions that were imposed there.
Non-Argumentative	 there will be a number of strict criteria to satisfy in the two rounds of testing.
Non-Argumentative	 technologies must demonstrate a minimum of 90% accuracy in recognising whether both a static or a moving ball is across the line.
Non-Argumentative	 technologies must also inform the referee about goal-line incidents with both a vibration and a display signal to his watch, wherever he is on the pitch.
Non-Argumentative	 the testing will be carried out under both daylight and floodlight conditions.
Non-Argumentative	 the news will be welcomed by uk companies such as hawk-eye and goalminder, who are convinced that their products are already 100% accurate.
Non-Argumentative	 this announcement, coupled with fifas previously unrelenting stance on glt, has re-ignited the technology debate.
Argumentative	 should glt be introduced to global football?
Argumentative	football is moving into the twenty-first century , yet the refusal to embrace glt is completely out-dated .
Argumentative	 nowhere in fifa policy does it state that referees can not use the influence of technology .
Argumentative	 in fifas disciplinary code  , articlestates that :, `` during matches , disciplinary decisions are taken by the referee '' , and, `` these decisions are final ``.
Argumentative	 the referee already `` acts on the advice of the assistant referees regarding incidents that he has not seen '' and can change decisions based on advice2 .
Argumentative	 all referees also have an earpiece , introduced in, linking the two assistant refs and the fourth official , which already demonstrates technology 's successful impact in football .
Argumentative	 glt is simply the next step .
Argumentative	 glt technology is readily available and could be quickly implemented .
Argumentative	 hawkeye , used in tennis and cricket , would serve the glt purpose very well .
Argumentative	 though eventually dismissed , it was suggested that gps technology could measure whether players are offside or not .
Argumentative	 cameras are already set up for television with enough angles to make decisions ; it would be simple to set up monitors pitch-side so that officials could watch replayed footage .
Argumentative	 currently , viewers watching at home are able to make much more informed decisions than match officials .
Argumentative	 goals are the ultimate measure of success in football ; technology would reduce the risk of teams losing matches unfairly due to controversial decisions , see fifa world cup quarter finalengland v germany .
Argumentative	 there is no reason to expose referees to criticism , threats and derision when we have the means to help them .
Argumentative	 glt is a tool meant to assist referees in their decisions , not undermine them .
Argumentative	 howard webb has added his voice to the pro-technology debate : `` anything that makes my job easier , that makes me more credible , i 've an open mind to .
Argumentative	 we are still using human opinion in those decisions and maybe on a matter of fact like the goal-line some technology might be the way forward .
Argumentative	 i personally prefer it when there is no debate about the referees .
Argumentative	 it 's a difficult position , to judge over the line .
Argumentative	 it 's at speed , and it ai n't easy .
Argumentative	 sometimes i feel in a less than privileged position by not having the opportunity , to use technology , but that 's where we are .
Argumentative	 it 's for other people to decide where that argument goes .
Argumentative	 ``
