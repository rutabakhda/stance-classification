Non-Argumentative	reverence and veneration of the national flag has long been profound in the united states, possibly more so than in many other countries.
Non-Argumentative	 this reverence has led many state legislatures as well as the federal congress to pass legislation banning the burning of the flag.
Non-Argumentative	 such legislation generally follows similar language, effectively banning the desecration of the national flag in protests, or other acts of desecration.
Non-Argumentative	 so far these bans have been struck down by the supreme court, which indescribed them as contrary to the principle of free speech.
Non-Argumentative	 nonetheless, popular support for such a ban remains high.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents of a ban argue that the special symbolic value of the flag to the american people is such that it must be protected by law, and that the right to free speech does not extend to the desecration of the emblem of the nation.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents contend that banning flag burning curtails a form of free speech and undermines the ability of people to protest the policies of the state.
Argumentative	 debates on the issue of flag burning usually revolve around the significance of the flag as a symbol of the nation, the value of flag burning as a means of protest, and on the extent to which free speech should be protected in society.
Argumentative	when destroying the flag of the united states it is the values of the united states that are under attack .
Argumentative	 since the birth of the nation the flag of the united states , the eponymous `` star-spangled banner '' , has been flown proudly in all parts of the country .
Argumentative	 it has become an endemic fixture in american culture and has come to be seen by people all over the united states , and the world , as a representation of the spirit and identity of nation .
Argumentative	 it appears on every seal of public office , is flown outside every public building and a flag-shaped pin is worn upon the breast of virtually every public figure .
Argumentative	 the flag has been imbued with a special significance by the citizens of the united states , and is viewed almost universally with extensive reverence1 .
Argumentative	 it has come to be seen as emblematic of all the values and virtues of american society .
Argumentative	 in a way it is the physical sublimation of those values ; at least that is how it is often treated .
Argumentative	 for this reason , to destroy the flag is to destroy the values they represent , and thus the flag must be protected in order to protect the values of the nation the flag represents .

Argumentative	 freedom of speech and expression is an important right , which is why it is listed first in the bill of rights ; it is central to a fair and free democracy .
Argumentative	 however , it has limits .
Argumentative	 some forms of speech are contrary to the values of democracy , namely when they infringe upon or violate the ability of others to enact their own rights and freedoms .
Argumentative	 this is why such things as incitement to hatred , other violence-promoting speech , as well as defamation and perjury are legislated against ; they are expressions that infringe the rights of others , by causing fear and increasing risk of harm in case of hate speech , and by harming reputations and the effective administration of justice in terms of defamation and perjury respectively .
Argumentative	 rights stop where harm to others begins .
Argumentative	 in the case of flag burning , as the dissenting opinion of justice william rehnquist on the issue says , the act is an extremely visceral one , and is often perceived as a direct attack on the core values of america itself , which many consider to be representative of those values , leading to feelings of anger and violation1 .
Argumentative	 it is an infringement of these offended people 's rights when flags are allowed to be burned .

Argumentative	 it is highly questionable whether burning a flag can be considered a speech or expressive act at all .
Argumentative	 it seems to offer up no new concepts or true opinions to the `` marketplace of ideas '' .
Argumentative	 nothing is genuinely expressed by the act that could not be done through words or other , less fiery means .
Argumentative	 the act of flag burning does nothing to help the advancement or elucidation of truth , which is why people have the right to freedom of expression in the first place .
Argumentative	 rather , it clouds the issue supposedly being furthered by the act .
Argumentative	 it welcomes the rhetoric of `` un-americanism '' , whereby critics and commentators question the protestors ' general patriotism , not the validity of their underlying cause , which can eventually lead to the same criticism of their cause itself .
Argumentative	 anger clouds the discussion , with people viewing the cause in terms of unpatriotic people supporting the cause , and thus calling for patriots to oppose it .
Argumentative	 examples of this problem can be seen clearly in the various protests during the vietnam war in which misguided protestors burned flags to show their opposition to the war and killing of innocents .
Argumentative	 the response to these protests , however , were accusations of lack of patriotism on the parts of those involved and gave a powerful rhetorical tool to the political groups still supporting the fight1 .
Argumentative	 furthermore , when anger and rhetoric cloud all discussion of an issue , it can lead to unmeasured , even violent responses from authorities and concerned citizens .
Argumentative	 flag burning is thus counterproductive as a tool of protest , since it stops the message being propagated and pollutes the forums of discourse from being able to search for answers reasonably .
Argumentative	 all national polls conducted in the united states have shown a majority popular support for banning flag burning1 .
Argumentative	 state and federal laws , passed by democratically elected representatives , have for decades passed popularly supported laws aimed at protecting the flag from desecration .
Argumentative	 the supreme court , however , has struck down these laws as being contrary to the rights to free speech , by a narrow 5-4 vote2 .
Argumentative	 yet popular support for such laws has not diminished .
Argumentative	 this has led to attempts to pass a flag desecration amendment to the constitution , which would then necessarily have to be accepted by the court .
Argumentative	 in, the house of representatives passed such an amendment by the requisite supermajority , and it died in the senate by only a single vote3 .
Argumentative	 clearly , the vast majority of citizens and legislators actively support legislation to protect the flag .
Argumentative	 law should reflect the will of the people and prevent the desecration of the nation 's most sacred symbol .
Argumentative	 failing to do so gives precedence to the rights of a small minority to perform an act that does not hold any major sway over their lives over the democratic rights of the democratic public .
