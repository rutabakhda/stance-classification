Non-Argumentative	the outing of gay celebrities is a difficult debate based around the balancing of societal benefit from the act with the rights of individuals to retain their right to privacy over their sexual orientation.
Non-Argumentative	 many gay rights activists support the act with websites such as “queer attitude” and “famous and gay” publicizing openly gay people in the public sphere, and continue to push for further exposure.
Non-Argumentative	 counter to this, groups such as the even the gay, lesbian and allies senate staff caucus in the united states remain fundamentally opposed to the outing of gay celebrities and politicians.
Non-Argumentative	 this exists in a situation where we ask the question not if it’s good for people to out themselves, but if we have the right to out individuals who have chosen not to already.
Argumentative	 outing gay celebrities puts the fight for gay equality in the fore of political discussion by removing the capacity for opposition to pass it off as a `` minority '' problem that is not of utmost concern .
Argumentative	 by outing gay celebrities we do two things .
Argumentative	 first , we both get rid of the narrative that says that being gay is uncommon and `` weird '' , which has been one of the ways right-wing parties have been able to prejudice the public against the gay rights movements .
Argumentative	 second , due to the public nature and high exposure of these individuals , it pushes the issue directly into the political spotlight , removing the ability of politicians to deny its significance or avoid discussing it as a pressing issue for legislation .
Argumentative	 by doing these two things , we propel the issue of gay rights into the political domain and help to shatter the harmful narratives opposition parties have fabricated to quell the struggle for equal rights .
Argumentative	 celebrities are uniquely placed to help break down misunderstanding and prejudice against the gay community .
Argumentative	 one of the biggest obstacles to breaking down prejudice is the fact that people do not associate with the cause and can view it as alien and a problem that `` they '' have , not one that `` we '' can understand .
Argumentative	 celebrities are uniquely placed to help bridge this gap and foster sympathy and understand about the fight for gay rights because of the relationship they foster with people in society .
Argumentative	 people feel as though they have an emotional connection and familiarity with the people who are rocketed into their family rooms through their tv every night .
Argumentative	 this level of familiarity means that when they are outed as gay leads to a breakdown of the idea that gay rights are an issue for `` them '' as it 's an issue that now directly affects you .
Argumentative	 moreover , the emotional connection you feel you have with the characters these people play , means that you personalize their situation more than you would with any other form of gay rights activism .
Argumentative	 therefore , outing gay celebrities fosters a particular type of sympathy and understanding for the cause that can not be achieved any other way .
Argumentative	 celebrities have a special obligation to society because their success and lives are directly created and maintained by society .
Argumentative	 celebrities are products of the society that admires them , and so as a result they owe a particularly high duty to that society .
Argumentative	 as a result , they have an obligation to help that community and whatever way they possibly can in return for the fact that their existence and success is facilitated by them .
Argumentative	 if gay celebrities do not out themselves to help the cause of an oppressed group in society , the society that has created them and their success has the right to do it for them .
Argumentative	 celebrities have limited rights to privacy when that privacy conflicts with the well-being of the individuals who create their success and celebrity status in the first place .
Argumentative	 therefore , the outing of gay celebrities is something that society is entitled to do as the lack of outing themselves breaks their obligation to the society that created them .
