Argumentative	sometimes we must accept those dangers , as they come in the course of necessary medical procedures .
Argumentative	 but with elective surgery -- procedures people do n't need , but rather merely want -- the risks ca n't be justified .
Argumentative	 these risks apply both to the surgery itself , and to the long term .
Argumentative	 for example , leaking silicone breast implants have been a widespread problem and can lead to death .
Argumentative	 silicone gel can leak from the implant into healthy breast tissue and go other parts of your body , such as the lungs and lymph nodes , where it could be impossible to remove.
Argumentative	studies published inby scientists at the national cancer institute raised questions about the long-term safety of breast implants .
Argumentative	 one study found that women who had breast implants for at least eight years were twice as likely to die from brain cancer , three times as likely to die from lung cancer or other respiratory diseases , and four times as likely to commit suicide , compared to other plastic surgery patientsa second study found that women with breast implants for at least eight years were% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to other women their age .
Argumentative	 there is also the risk that the person having the surgery will be dissatisfied with the results .
Argumentative	 only those that can pay for it get it .
Argumentative	 the most popular surgeries include breast augmentation , liposuction , nasal surgery , eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty .
Argumentative	 there surgeries cost between # 3,000 and #, between # 2,500 and # 6,000 , between # 3,500 and # 4,000 and between # 2,000 to # 6,000 respectively .
Argumentative	 so if it has the advantages the opposition claims , the rich will look good , and the poor will not .
Argumentative	 there is considerable evidence that women 's attractiveness is judged more harshly than men 's .
Argumentative	 for example , in a study by adams and huston  participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of photographs of people of varying ages .
Argumentative	 they found that although attractiveness ratings of both men and women declined with age , the rate of decline for women was greater .
Argumentative	 researchers report that women 's magazines have ten and one-half times more ads and articles promoting weight loss than men 's magazines do , and over three-quarters of the covers of women 's magazines include at least one message about how to change a woman 's bodily appearance -- by diet , exercise or cosmetic surgery .
Argumentative	 these views about appearance are damaging because it leads to seriously unhealthy lifestyles that women think they need to look beautiful .
Argumentative	 for example , in, teen magazine reported thatper cent of girlstoyears old have been on at least one diet , and thattoper cent of normal weight girls believe they are overweight .
Argumentative	 cosmetic surgery sends the message that the prejudices some have about appearance are valid .
