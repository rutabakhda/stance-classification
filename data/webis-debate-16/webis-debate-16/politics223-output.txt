Non-Argumentative	on thursdayseptemberpeople in scotland will vote on the question 'should scotland be an independent country'.
Non-Argumentative	 what scotland's relationship with europe will be in one, five or ten years after the referendum is unclear.
Non-Argumentative	            a scot voting no (to remain in the uk) could not be sure that scotland will be in the eu in a decade because of the possibility of a uk referendum on leaving the eu.
Non-Argumentative	 in januarythe coalition government passed a bill that implemented a 'referendum lock' which would require a uk referendum on the eu if there were any major treaty changes.
Non-Argumentative	 this lock is currently the only legislation for a referendum.
Non-Argumentative	 however, in januarydavid cameron promised an in/out eu referendum by the end ofif he won the next general election.
Non-Argumentative	 despite this commitment tory eurosceptics regretted the lack of an eu referendum in the queen's speech and so put forward their own referendum bill which is going through the commons to guarantee a vote, at the time of writing it looks likely to pass (and then get savaged in the house of lords which however cant stop the commons passing it).
Non-Argumentative	 therefore a referendum on staying in or leaving the eu looks likely within the next five years or so.
Non-Argumentative	            a scot voting yes (to create an independent scotland) would be equally unsure of the implications of their choice.
Non-Argumentative	 scotland's relationship with the eu in the event of independence is a hotly contested issue which the subject of the debate, the eu itself, has done little to clarify.
Non-Argumentative	 nothing in the eu treaties deals with what would happen should a region within the eu become independent.
Non-Argumentative	 whether scotland is regarded as a continuing state or a new state affects whether it would remain in the eu or would have to apply for membership.
Non-Argumentative	 the commission has implied it would have to apply for membership and this raises the possibility that scotland would at least temporarily leave the eu following independence.
Non-Argumentative	            certainly there would be much more clarity to a vote on scottish independence if scottish voters knew whether they were voting to remain part of a uk within the eu or one that would not be, rather than voting not knowing if they would be ejected from the eu against their will a few years down the line.
Non-Argumentative	 this argument has been made by those in favour of an early eu referendum but is now certain not to happen.
Argumentative	 the scottish national party , snp , has said that they would not hold an eu referendum in an independent scotland .
Argumentative	 scotland is interestingly should scotland become independent and accede to the eu there would have to be a treaty change to provide for scottish representation in eu institutions .
Argumentative	 this could well trigger an eu referendum in the remainder of the uk , ruk , under the ` referendum lock ' .
Argumentative	 according to a februaryipsos-mori poll scots want an eu referendum but% would vote to stay in the eu and only% would vote to leave .
Argumentative	 indeed if scotland became independent those who wanted it to be in the eu rose to% and the number who wanted out fell to% .
Argumentative	 in england% would vote to leave , as of november, and% would vote to stay in .
Argumentative	 the uk independence party whose principal policy platform is a desire to leave the eu has performed considerably worse in scotland than in england .
Argumentative	 in thegeneral election ukip received 3.1 % of the vote whereas in the scottish election the next year they only received 0.9 % of the vote .
Argumentative	 similarly in theeuropean parliament elections ukip came second nationally receiving almost 2.5 million votes , 16.5 % of all votes cast but in scotland it came 6th , beaten by all four main parties and the greens receiving only 5.2 % of the vote .
Argumentative	 scots clearly believe their interests lie with europe and it would be better for scotland not to be tied to a country where sentiment is considerably more negative towards the eu .
Argumentative	 states are often seen as having one single unitary interest , however this is not the case the interests of different regions can be very different .
Argumentative	 it should therefore not be surprising that scotland and ruk have different interests with relation to the eu .
Argumentative	 for example on climate change scotland has the greatest potential for the generation of renewable energy in europe with% of europe 's tidal potential and% of wave potential yet the uk is in favour of scrapping european targets for the generation of renewable energy .
Argumentative	 uk ministers have also been accused of `` working against scotland '' on agriculture being willing to accept reductions in farm support meaning that scotland receives the lowest level in europe .
Argumentative	 scotland 's own interests would therefore be better represented by having its own government at the negotiating table than a uk government .
