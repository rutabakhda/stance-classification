Non-Argumentative	college football is the only major sport, collegiate and professional, that does not have a standard playoff at the end of the season to determine a champion.
Non-Argumentative	 the creation of the bowl championship series (bcs) inwas intended to cure some of these problems, by offering up a tiered system of bowl-games that matched equivalently seeded teams against each other, and which matched up - supposedly - the two best teams in the country against one another in the national championship.
Non-Argumentative	 specifically, there are five championships “bowls” meaning ten teams are selected for these championships.
Non-Argumentative	 the ten teams selected include the six conference champions from selected automatically qualifying conferences and four others.
Non-Argumentative	 the top two of these ten are then selected for the national championship.
Non-Argumentative	yet, this system has been met with significant criticism over the years, particularly from the supporters of teams that have gone undefeated, and yet who have not received an invitation to play in the bcs championship.
Non-Argumentative	 an undefeated auburn was denied such a chance in 2004, boise state’s undefeatedseason - which included a win over heavily-favoured oklahoma in the fiesta bowl - was not worthy to be rewarded with a shot at the national championship, and utah's undefeated team inwas also denied a chance.
Non-Argumentative	 supporters of these teams and others have argued that a playoff - which would likely take the form oforteams - would give a fairer chance to such teams to demonstrate that they are the rightful national champions.
Non-Argumentative	 the idea has gained so much support over the years that a bill was drafted in the senate incalled the college football playoffs act of 2009.
Non-Argumentative	 president-elect barack obama gave support to the idea of an 8-team playoff shortly after his election, saying, "i’m going to throw my weight around a little bit, "i think it’s the right thing to do.
Non-Argumentative	"buoyed by such support, the idea of college football playoffs continues to gain momentum, with debate becoming increasingly intense.
Argumentative	 the bcs system unfairly discriminates againstof theteams that participate in college football .
Argumentative	 given that some of these teams participate in non-bcs leagues they can perform incredibly well and still not get into the bcs .
Argumentative	 further , the bcs system is flawed beyond this given that both boise state and utah were deemed unsuitable for the competition despite the fact that they went undefeated in the seasons before their rejection .
Argumentative	 the winner of the bcs is meant to be the best collegiate football team in the country .
Argumentative	 however , if undefeated teams are unable to compete it makes the system incredibly unfair , and reduces the legitimacy of the bcs title itself , undermining the value of the competition overall .
Argumentative	 finally , as noted football analyst michael shull notes , due to flaws in the computer algorithms used to allocated bcs places , some teams that do well for a single season as an outlier or due to a positive change for the team do not get into the cup .
Argumentative	 this potentially means that the same teams consistently get into the cup and gain $million in revenue regardless of whether they win or lose .
Argumentative	 as such this system ensures that those who do get selected just get richer and better and thus become more likely to be picked by the computer system in the future .
Argumentative	 within the playoff system every game during the playoffs is a knockout .
Argumentative	 as such , every single game in the playoffs carries the potential risk of excluding the losing team from the remainder of that season 's games .
Argumentative	 this works incredibly well to build up tension , because favourites have lost to teams that were believed to be a lot worse .
Argumentative	 with history supporting this idea all players and fans are likely to feel tension during the playoff games which directly contributes to the enjoyment of a game .
Argumentative	 further , given the prevalence of late game comebacks in american football , due the ever present threat of an interception , it means that fans are still likely to enjoy games even when their team is likely to lose going into the later quarters .
Argumentative	 further , the playoff system still significantly incentivises good work during the regular season .
Argumentative	 the top ranked team would face the lowest ranked team in the first round and gain home field advantage for being the higher seed .
Argumentative	 it is beneficial for both sides because under bcs , the second team has no guarantee that it would even be included and the former team would not be guaranteed home field advantage .
Argumentative	 the issue with the bcs system , as mentioned above , is that teams selected by an often broken and biased bcs mechanism receive more money and exposure than more talented , harder working institutions , making them more likely to be selected by the same mechanism in the future .
Argumentative	 standout teams that only perform that well for a season are able to get significantly more exposure under the proposition model .
Argumentative	 due to the very high profile nature of playoff games - as well as the fact that there would simply be more playoff games with palpably fair and meritocratic outcomes later in the playoffs - more people will watch college football .
Argumentative	 specifically , including more teams in a playoff based competition will mean that more fans get their favourites in to the playoffs and as such more people watch .
Argumentative	 secondly , the increased number of matches ' means that it is more likely that fans will be able to catch another match if they can not watch one .
Argumentative	 finally , should an upset happen , the amount of interest generated in the subsequent match is incredibly great and generates significantly more exposure for both teams participating .
