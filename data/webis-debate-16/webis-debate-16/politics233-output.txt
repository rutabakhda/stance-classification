Non-Argumentative	the united states initiated military operations in libya in early march of 2011, with a broad international coalition under nato command, in order to defend civilians engaging in a popular revolution against muammar gadaffi.
Non-Argumentative	 the brutal suppression and murder of these civilians by gadaffi's regime led to calls by the arab league for nato action as well as un resolution 1973, which authorized the limited mission of protecting libyan civilians with a no-fly zone.
Non-Argumentative	 the us and nato attempted to execute this mandate by bombing select pro-qaddafi forces and munitions and maintaining air superiority over the country.
Non-Argumentative	 the us formally transferred command of these operations to nato on april 1st.
Non-Argumentative	 the conflict continued apace through june.
Non-Argumentative	 during this period, it became clear that the us and nato mission had extended beyond simply protecting civilians to regime change.
Non-Argumentative	 this has included the active military support of anti-gadaffi forces as well as targeted bombing campaigns.
Non-Argumentative	 an international debate has followed these events.
Non-Argumentative	 many in the us have claimed that president obama needed congressional approval afterdays of the conflict, in accordance with the war powers act.
Non-Argumentative	 but the president has argued that this law, passed in the wake of the vietnam war, does not apply because us engagement does not rise to the level of "hostilities" contemplated by the law.
Non-Argumentative	 other questions concern whether the war has extended beyond the un mandate and whether the engagement is even worthwhile for nato, the us, and the wider world.
Argumentative	 the pros and cons in this contentious debate are considered below.
Argumentative	there are multiple arguments indicating why the u.s. might be engaged in hostilities under the war powers act , enough so that this single argument could make an entire two person case .
Argumentative	 the u.s. has engaged in sustained hostilities in libya which have resulted in regime change within the country .
Argumentative	 the president himself admits that causing regime change would be unjustifiable in his speech justifying the war by pledging that `` broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake . ''
Argumentative	 2 however , regime change was the result of the mission and nato and u.s. played a significant role in facilitating that change .
Argumentative	 secondly , the war powers act covers the u.s. fighting in a supportive role in wars .
Argumentative	 `` for purposes of this chapter , the term ` introduction of united states armed forces ' includes the assignment of members of such armed forces to command , coordinate , participate in the movement of , or accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country or government when such military forces are engaged , or there exists an imminent threat that such forces will become engaged , in hostilities . ''
Argumentative	 3 hence the u.s. is acting in violation of this condition .
Argumentative	 further , troops do not need to be on the ground to call the libyan engagement hostilities .
Argumentative	 u.s. men and women have firstly died in the conflict , but secondly if troops were needed on the ground for a war , a u.s. president could potentially fire a thousand missiles at a country without the engagement being considered a war .
Argumentative	 further , even though the u.s. gave powers to nato , it maintained a lead role in this coalition force .
Argumentative	 as such , the engagement should still be subject to u.s. laws and rules .
Argumentative	 finally , the sheer cost of the engagement to the u.s. taxpayer implies that it should be considered a war .
Argumentative	 the cost of the war has been more than $million per day .1 firstly , libya did not attack us soldiers and did not harm us citizens .
Argumentative	 given that this is true , then engagement with libya to begin with goes against the spirit of us law .
Argumentative	 given that the situation is not an emergency for the u.s. circumventing congress in order to prosecute the war is incredibly harmful as it undermines one of the core institutions in u.s. democracy .
Argumentative	 further , the use of international organisations such as the un and nato to circumvent congress has bad ramifications for the future as in doing this the u.s. government has significantly lowered the burden required to go to war should it wish to do so in the future .
Argumentative	 this is problematic because the decision to go to war should never be one that is taken lightly .
Argumentative	 should the u.s. wish to go to war again then it might end up in a situation such as vietnam , the conflict that inspired the creation of the war powers act .1 firstly , the un intervention in libya wrongly rests on nato authority .
Argumentative	 the use of nato to circumvent congressional approval in this situation violates the initial agreement regarding the participation of the u.s. in nato that was ratified by congress .
Argumentative	 as such , even if the u.s. is legitimate in going to war and the circumvention of war powers can be justified , the circumvention using nato can not .
Argumentative	 secondly , the use of un approval to circumvent congress means that the un charter and the ideals of the un have been placed by the government at a higher level of value than of the us constitution .
Argumentative	 if this is the case then the government has undermined the validity of the us constitution and through doing that has undermined all laws within the u.s. which is harmful should the u.s. wish to project power in a way that is contrary to the un 's wishes .1
