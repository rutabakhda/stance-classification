Non-Argumentative	for its size and wealth north korea gets a lot of international attention.
Non-Argumentative	 it regularly gets into the media around the world and is the subject of numerous high powered rounds of talks and discussions in the security council.
Non-Argumentative	 yet despite all the attention north korea gets from the press, diplomats, and policymakers north korea also regularly seems to get its own way in negotiations and its on-going brinkmanship with the rest of the world despite the obvious disparities between the north korean state and even its southern adversary let along the united states.
Non-Argumentative	north korea, formally the democratic people’s republic of korea, occupies the northern half of the korean peninsula which was divided at the 38th parallel at the end of the second world war with the northern half administered by the soviet union while the south was administered by the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 the soviet union handed over control to the democratic people’s republic in 1948.
Non-Argumentative	 war between the two koreas in the early 1950s did not resolve the split and today korea is one of the few areas where the cold war continues.
Non-Argumentative	north korea is small, at 120,000km2 slightly smaller than the us state of mississippi, is mostly mountainous, has a relatively small population of 24.5 million people who are extremely poor with gdp per capita at purchasing power parity of $1,800.
Non-Argumentative	 the attention this country gets is therefore completely out of proportion with the importance that would normally be given a country of similar size and wealth, for example cambodia.
Non-Argumentative	 north korea’s influence comes from several factors;should the great powers in the region simply ignore the regime and continue business as usual when these intermittent provocations occur?
Argumentative	 the two koreas should be able to solve the situation themselves without recourse to all the neighbouring powers -- whose interest does not seem to have spurred a solution to the frozen conflict anyway .
Argumentative	 with the cold war over south korea is more than capable of handling its own security .
Argumentative	 south korea is economically far ahead of the north with its economy thirty seven times bigger .
Argumentative	 its military is also more capable than the north 's as the international institute for strategic studies argues `` as measured by static equipment indices , south korea 's conventional forces would appear superior to north korea 's .
Argumentative	 when morale , training , equipment maintenance , logistics , and reconnaissance and communications capabilities are factored in , this qualitative advantage increases . ''
Argumentative	 so should be able to deter aggression on its own and pull its own weight in negotiations without the need of a multilateral process .
Argumentative	 moreover no one would argue that an invasion should be ignored however the south should be the one who responds to north korean actions on its own .
Argumentative	 north korea has an attention seeking cycle on the go that was used by kim jong il and now seems to be used by his son kim jong un .
Argumentative	 essentially north korea takes a provocative action , as big or small as it thinks necessary -- this may be a missile launch , right up to some kind of military attack , in order to grab the world 's attention .
Argumentative	 there is then a period where there are condemnations and threats to increase sanctions that usually do n't get anywhere as they are blocked by china .
Argumentative	 the north korean regime will then proclaim a willingness to do business and negotiate giving minor concessions on the issue of the provocation in return for aid or whatever the regime happens to want at the time .
Argumentative	 of course whatever concession it gives is easily reversible so setting up another round .
Argumentative	 this is a good deal for north korea as it essentially gets aid in return for bad behaviour , it is therefore not surprising that the north is willing to continue engaging in bad behaviour .
Argumentative	 the responses to north korean provocations do not bring a solution any closer .
Argumentative	 north korea has yet to sign a peace treaty with the south and the united states .
Argumentative	 it is however particularly interested in signing a treaty with the united states rather than the south .
Argumentative	 inthe north korean foreign ministry proposed that `` if confidence is to be built between , north korea , and the us , it is essential to conclude a peace treaty for terminating the state of war , a root cause of the hostile relations , to begin with '' .
Argumentative	 the north wants a peace treaty with the us so as to drive a wedge between the usa and south korea to prevent us support for the south in the event of war .
Argumentative	 ignoring such efforts at negotiating with the usa without south korea in the room , and indeed all advances and provocations would force the north to accept that it has to negotiate with the south or with no one .
Argumentative	 ignoring north korean actions and reducing the number of allies negotiating while maintaining security guarantees prevents any chance of the north dividing the usa and south korea .
