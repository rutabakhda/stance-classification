Non-Argumentative	 this help is to ensure that african states are capable of deterring terrorism within their own lands and ensure stability on the continent.
Non-Argumentative	this is focused around whether or not this assistance has been more of a help or a hindrance for africa in the face of the continent’s major challenges.
Argumentative	 the united states has one of the most elite and experienced counter-terrorism forces in the world , africa could only benefit from the help they offer .
Argumentative	 branches of the us military which specialise in counter-terrorism , such as the us navy seals and delta force , receive rigorous training and have gained experience from numerous operations .
Argumentative	 many african states lack the ability to train and utilise such forces , which is why us help is welcome .
Argumentative	 us military advisers were sent to uganda to help combat the lord 's resistance army , lra , and assisted with ` an impact disproportionate to its size ' .
Argumentative	 betweenand, the lra 's attacks were halved and the conflict 's death toll decreased by% .
Argumentative	 the experience that these forces provide is visibly valuable for africa 's counter-terrorism activities .
Argumentative	 africa is the least developed continent in the world and will struggle to independently maintain a specialised counter-terrorism force .
Argumentative	 thirty four of its fifty four states are classed as ` least developed countries ' .

Argumentative	 the failure of the au 's measures in sudan duringforced them to appeal to the un for aid .
Argumentative	 this was effectively an admission of failure , signifying these actors as weak in comparison to the usa .
Argumentative	 the presence of us military equipment and counter-terrorism forces in africa will result in greater security for the rest of the world .
Argumentative	 many of the terrorist groups which have existed in the ` ungoverned ' spaces of africa have an international agenda .
Argumentative	 al-qaeda and other groups have used africa as a base to plan attacks against the west , such as themadrid bombing .
