Non-Argumentative	heathrow is london’s, and there the united kingdom’s, main airport.
Non-Argumentative	 it is the world’s fourth busiest airport and handles more international passengers than any other airport.
Non-Argumentative	 since 1950, a couple of years after heathrow first opened, the number of passengers passing through uk airports has increased a hundred fold.
Non-Argumentative	 and numbers are forecast to continue increasing, doubling again to reach 480million byso airports are becoming congested.
Non-Argumentative	 there is then a clear need to expand the existing infrastructure or build anew.
Non-Argumentative	 unfortunately this is not a simple proposition, expanding existing airports inevitably encounters local opposition due to the added noise it would cause.
Non-Argumentative	 simply building new airports ad hoc to meet demand is also not possible due to the need for airlines to mostly use hub airports so any new airport would need to be very large and would be a very long term project.
Non-Argumentative	hub airports are where airlines converge their flights on large airports in order to use that airport as a transfer point to enable their passengers to get to their intended destination.
Non-Argumentative	 a ‘hub’ airport essentially depends on two factors: 1) the ‘spokes’ of the hub, these are feeder airports that, lacking enough demand, do not keep open a large range of routes for efficiency reasons, instead sending passengers to the hubs to board onward flights, and 2) whether the ‘hub’ airport itself has the capacity to receive and manage the demand of its ‘spokes’, which is to say whether the ‘hub’ is big enough or not.
Non-Argumentative	 having an airport with a large capacity and a strategic situation, it is the case of london with regards to transatlantic exchanges, is the basis for having a ‘hub’.
Non-Argumentative	the argument about expanding heathrow, britain’s main hub airport, and how to meet increasing demand if not expanding heathrow, has been raging for several years with the government unwilling to come to a final decision.
Non-Argumentative	 in the debate the airlines, british airports association, and business more generally, are pitted against local communities and environmentalists in disagreements over the necessity of more runways and the impact those expansions will have.
Non-Argumentative	 the other side of the debate is less about whether expansion should occur at all but more over whether it should occur at heathrow or in other locations as gatwick, stansted, or in the thames estuary as proposed by london’s mayor boris johnson.
Argumentative	 put simply heathrow is at the limits of its capacity so there needs to be expansion .
Argumentative	 heathrow is already at% capacity and running so close to maximum capacity means that any minor problem can result in large delays for passengers .
Argumentative	 london 's major rivals have four-runway hub airports paris , frankfurt , even madrid this means these cities have much greater capacity as they can take up to 700,000 flights a year compared to heathrow 's 480,000 .
Argumentative	 britain does not want to be left behind , crumbling in the dust .
Argumentative	 these airports therefore clearly have the capacity to take flights that would otherwise be going to heathrow .
Argumentative	 heathrow needs to expand to maintain its competitiveness so that the airport retains its position the most popular place to stop-over in before catching a connecting flight .
Argumentative	 colin matthews , the chief executive of heathrow , formerly baa , has argued that heathrow 's lack of hub capacity currently costs the uk # 14billion .
Argumentative	 heathrow is in danger of falling behind continental rivals in frankfurt and amsterdam .
Argumentative	 expanding heathrow would ensure many current jobs as well as creating new ones .
Argumentative	 currently , heathrow supports around 250,000 jobs .
Argumentative	 added to this many hundreds of thousands more are dependent upon the tourist trade in london which relies on good transport links like heathrow .
Argumentative	 loosing competitiveness in front of other european airports not only could imply wasting the possibility to create new jobs , but lose some of those that already exist .
Argumentative	 expansion of heathrow would also be building a vital part of infrastructure at a time when british infrastructure spending is very low as a result of the recession so helping to boost growth .
Argumentative	 good flight connections are critical for attracting new business and maintaining current business .
Argumentative	 this is because aviation infrastructure is important for identifying new business opportunities .
Argumentative	 the uk 's economic future depends on trading not just with traditional destinations in europe and america but also with the expanding cities of china and india , cities such as chongqing and chengdu .
Argumentative	 businesses based in these cities will be much more likely to invest in britain with direct flights .
Argumentative	 flying is critical for business .
Argumentative	 heathrow is well located for the people that will pick up the bill funding its expansion .
Argumentative	 people need to be able to get to their homes and work easily from the airport otherwise it is impractical .
Argumentative	 according to the civil aviation authority% of business passengers start their journey withinminutes of heathrow , far more than any other airport .
Argumentative	 this demonstrates that the demand for heathrow 's services from the local area is real and pronounced .
Argumentative	 heathrow is closer to london than its rivals gatwick and stansted and has better transport links through the piccadilly line and heathrow express .
Argumentative	 a new airport could potentially be closer , but finding space within the m25 for a large airport without attracting the same kind of opposition that expanding heathrow has would be next to impossible
