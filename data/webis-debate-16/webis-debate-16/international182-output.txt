Non-Argumentative	in 2012, gabon, along with equatorial guinea, hosted the africa cup of nations, the primary international football competition in africa.
Non-Argumentative	 both nations held an equal number of matches, with gabon holding the final, and equatorial guinea the bronze medal match and opening game.
Non-Argumentative	 these two relatively small countries (equatorial guinea with a population under one million, and gabon under two million) hosted the tournament for the first time, previous host nations including angola (whose tournament inwas marred by the attack on the bus carrying the togo team to cabinda), ghana and egypt.
Non-Argumentative	 gabon, whose share of matches included the final, was perhaps more of a sporting success than imagined: both host nations reached the quarter finals.
Non-Argumentative	 a number of key african footballing powerhouses, such as nigeria, south africa, egypt, cameroon and algeria failed to qualify.
Non-Argumentative	 the two nations were selected as hosts in 2006.
Non-Argumentative	high profile sporting events are always controversial because of their expense and the coverage they bring if nothing else.
Non-Argumentative	 while not on the same scale as the olympic games or the world cup (which has been hosted within africa: south africa in 2010), the africa cup of nations is the most high profile truly african event, not only receiving extensive coverage within the continent but also outside the region, including in the uk.
Non-Argumentative	 while both countries are of medium development as per (non inequality adjusted) un human development index figures, a particular focus was put on the human rights record on both nations, in particular that of gabon’s co-hosts, equatorial guinea.
Argumentative	 the benefits of hosting these events for african nations include the ability to concentrate on infrastructure for the event .
Argumentative	 in addition to sporting infrastructure , which could last well in excess ofyears , homes , hospitals , roads and schools have been constructed in gabon 's host cities .
Argumentative	 the chinese government assisted funding of some of this ; it co-financed and helped construct the stade de l’amitié-sino-gabonaise , the biggest stadium .
Argumentative	 the benefits of these events , unlike hosting an event such as an olympic games , which would be outside the reach of gabon or equatorial guinea , especially with the increasing trend of the ioc to select major world cities in medium or high income countries , is that more than one site in a country can host different parts of the tournament .
Argumentative	 this provides a platform for a focus on broad based development across the entire nation , rather than one-sideded development focused on one city .
Argumentative	 in gabon 's case there was both construction of the stade de l’amitié-sino-gabonaise in the capital and a rebuild of a stadium in franceville for $ 76.2 million .
Argumentative	 there is a big benefit for small businesses in hosting the large sporting events .
Argumentative	 the hosting of the tournament inhas been credited by african economic outlook with playing a role in the `` robust '' economic growth in the country in that year turning the country around from negative growth in.
Argumentative	 theafrica cup of nations was credited with 10,000 jobs and helping the tourist sectors of the south african economy , gabon would have received a similar boost .
