Non-Argumentative	maryam omidicity press should not have yielded to the anc’s political bullying.
Non-Argumentative	 while i understand that the paper compromised a principle – in this case the right to free speech – for social harmony, i think it sets a harmful precedent.

Argumentative	 the artist that painted ` the spear ' , brett murray , created the piece as part of an exhibition that reflected his own discontent at the lack of major progress since the ruling african national congress took power in south africa after the end of apartheid in.

Argumentative	 the goodman gallery saw no issue with murray 's work to the extent that they prevented any particular works from being displayed .
Argumentative	 as it was their venue which was the setting for ` the spear 's display , the goodman gallery had the right to take decisions independently of external pressure .
Argumentative	 the removal of the exhibit sets a dangerous precedent whereby government can unduly censor artworks , threatening the free actions of artists and the galleries that display their work in turn affecting plural , democratic discourse .
Argumentative	 the removal of ` the spear ' from the goodman gallery and the city press also hints at a threat to pluralism , especially when one considers the political nature of the campaign to have such images removed .
Argumentative	 while jacob zuma attempted to have the image banned in a personal capacity , the intensive campaigning by both the anc and the congress of south african trade unions , cosatu , against both the goodman gallery and city press hints at a dangerously political action taken by those with close access to power over the south african state .

Argumentative	 some politicians within the anc , most notably the former president of its youth wing julius malema , have made incendiary statements that could be seen to stoke up hatred against whites .
Argumentative	 it is against this back drop that the double standards over criticism of murray should be viewed .
Argumentative	 murray , a white artist , has been criticised roundly for ` the spear ' , while black artists have created works that could be seen to denigrate president zuma in a similar manner to ` the spear ' .
Argumentative	 a noticeable example is ` ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi ' , better a fool than a rich man 's nonsense , by ayanda mabulu , that carried a much more graphic depiction of the president and other leading politicians of the past and present with barely a murmur raised .
Argumentative	 by bowing to the pressure exerted by the anc and its followers , the goodman gallery and city press have bowed to pressure , denying criticism of the government and accepting the implied view that white south africans are unable to criticise the government without seeking to re-assert any forms of superiority that had existed under apartheid .
Argumentative	 whilst there may still be underlying problems of far-right activity in south africa , to smear anyone who criticises the government based on their race does nothing to help move the country on from autocracy and institutionalised racism .
Argumentative	 the goodman gallery and city press should have stood by displaying the image as it represented the opinion of brett murray , free from intimidation or race based slander .
