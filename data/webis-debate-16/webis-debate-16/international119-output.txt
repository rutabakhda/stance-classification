Non-Argumentative	the east african community was formed in novemberby the republics of uganda, kenya and the united republic of tanzania following the collapse of a previous community in 1977.
Non-Argumentative	 rwanda and burundi later joined the organisation in july 2007.
Non-Argumentative	 with a strong vision of a prosperous, stable, competitive, secure and politically united east africa, (1) the bloc has been hailed as the most active, vibrant and successful  in the african continent.
Non-Argumentative	(2) progress has been made in lifting immigration checks and controls to allow free movement of people among member states without travel documents, introducing the common market to boost trade in the region, unifying the education system, and most recently signing up to an east african monetary union with an aim of introducing one currency in 2024.
Non-Argumentative	  the communities successes has encouraged neighbouring countries including sudan, south sudan, ethiopia, somalia and the democratic republic of congo to show interest in joining the organisation (3) with a most recent application from south sudan in july 2011.
Non-Argumentative	 the east african community therefore has both options to widen by letting in new members and to deepen the community by implementing its proposed monetary union.
Argumentative	 should the community be focused on deepening or widening?
Argumentative	widening the east african community , will help enlarge the common market , increase production and improve regional trade as people will be able to freely do business across more than five countries .
Argumentative	 prior to rwanda and burundi 's membership to the bloc in, kenya 's exports and imports to the eac were kshsbillion and kshsbillion respectively this however increased after the two countries joined creating a single market of 133.5 million people .
Argumentative	 inkenya 's exports had risen to kshs 90.5 billion and imports to kshs 12.5 billion  .
Argumentative	 ethiopia , drc and south sudan are all mineral rich countries and are big potential markets for east africa .
Argumentative	 welcoming them to the community is predicted to double the production , imports and exports among member states  due to policies policies like the eac trade facilitation , customs union and competition policy and law  .
Argumentative	 widening the east african community will help provide a strong force and voice against insecurities , conflicts and insurgencies that have torn apart much of the region .
Argumentative	 the current eac member states have been at the fore front of maintaining peace and security in the region , with burundi , kenya and uganda sending troops to somalia and rwanda sending troops to darfur and car .
Argumentative	 in march, the usaid assessment on east africa regional conflict and instability highlighted that the revival and expansion of the eac would favour a vision of promoting peace in the region  pointing out the lamu project aimed at creating a transport corridor linking south sudan to northern kenya and the coast .
Argumentative	 widening the bloc will make it easy for member states to support their peacekeeping missions through the east africa community military command and also help reduce interstate invasions like sudan and south sudan or rwanda and drc as they will now be united with more closely aligned interests .
Argumentative	 unlike other regional blocs in africa the eac has been keen to work on the improvement of education among member states .
Argumentative	 it has policies such as the introduction of the inter university council of education to ensure the quality of university education , and an ongoing process of harmonising education curricula in all member countries  .
Argumentative	 however , africa still remains the continent with poorest quality of education and has the lowest skilled/educated labour .
Argumentative	 a large number of children fail to access basic education  .
Argumentative	 enlarging and deepening the eac will therefore enhance education standards on a large part of the african continent ; such policies will lift weak academic institutions in drc , south sudan and somalia which are typical of their poor education systems .
Argumentative	 nkwame nkurumah , one of the famous african heroes said `` africa must unite or perish '' .
Argumentative	 this has been taken up by the african union which is calling for integration across the continent  .
Argumentative	 widening and deepening the eac will therefore shine a light to the ideology of pan africanism .
Argumentative	 bringing more african states together under one bloc with the same vision and institutions will help people to work together regardless of ethnic or cultural differences .
Argumentative	 citizens will feel more east africans rather than citizens of a particular country as every citizen of the eac member state is allowed to freely travel in the region with no difficulties or discrimination as a result of the east african community 's freedom of movement  .
Argumentative	 this will therefore encourage other blocs like the ecowas and sadc to actively perform and widen hence creating a more united africa .
