Non-Argumentative	despite the increasingly tolerant attitude towards homosexuality in society, especially in the west, the treatment of homosexuals continues to differ from one country to another.
Non-Argumentative	 in some nations, homosexuality is illegal whilst in others, homosexuals are now accorded an increasing catalogue of rights that have been enjoyed by heterosexuals all along.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk for instance, by virtue of a ruling of the european court of human rights in lustig-prean and beckett v uk (1999) gays can now serve in the armed forces.
Non-Argumentative	 despite these gains, in most countries gays have yet to attain complete equality of status in the eyes of the law, most notably the right to marry.
Non-Argumentative	 for many gay people, and for those who find gay rights troubling, the demand for a right to marry a person of the same gender has become the key modern political issue.
Non-Argumentative	 south africa, belgium, the netherlands, canada, argentina, portugal, sweden, iceland, norway and spain all allow gay marriage, while twenty-two other countries, including the uk, allow civil partnerships which give gay partners all the legal rights of marriage.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents argue that preventing gays from marrying is discriminatory and that it upholds a traditional, out-dated concept of marriage as the path to procreation.
Argumentative	 opponents insist however that marriage is tied to the traditional and religious bonds which overtly suggest marriage is between a man and a woman.
Argumentative	it is inaccurate to perceive marriage merely as an institution for child-raising purposes .
Argumentative	 there are many married couples in society today who do not have children of their own , often by choice , and infertile couples , who can not conceive children , are still permitted to marry .
Argumentative	 they marry because marriage symbolizes a long-term commitment to one another , not a pledge to reproduce for the state or humanity as a whole .
Argumentative	 in any case , gay couples may adopt children in countries where they are permitted to do so , revealing society 's view at large that homosexual couples can readily act as capable parents and provide loving home environments .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the advance of medical science has also enabled same-sex couples to have children of their own through surrogate mothers and sperm donors .
Argumentative	 it can no longer be said that homosexual couples should not be granted the right to marriage because , either , they can not have children , or that they can not raise children adequately .
Argumentative	 both claims are evidently false .
Argumentative	 to allow gay couples to marry would enable them to take advantage of the various fiscal benefits accorded to married couples in general .
Argumentative	 as scott bidstrup argues , a gay couple together foryears can still be compelled by law to testify or provide evidence against one another , something married spouses can not be forced to do.
Argumentative	 such antiquated laws take the discriminatory view that the love between homosexuals is artificial and extend it to encompass legal benefits .
Argumentative	 as justice anthony kennedy noted in a supreme court ruling , ` homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint '.
Argumentative	 a gay couple 's inability to reproduce should not prevent them from obtaining the benefits of marriage , benefits granted not to encourage or reward child birth but to recognize the bond between two loved ones .
Argumentative	 the state is charged with the responsibility of both providing registrars to conduct marriage ceremonies and authenticating marriages certificates .
Argumentative	 if gay marriage was to be legalized , all registrars could be thereafter forced , by the state and their commitment to the law , to legally bind themselves to avoid discriminating between homosexual and heterosexual couples who ask for their service .
Argumentative	 all registrars who refused to marry homosexual couples could be fired .
Argumentative	 there could be no difference in the process or the paperwork required for either a heterosexual or homosexual marriage .
Argumentative	 the dismissal of discriminating registrants would have a legal precedent in the charges brought upon hotel owners who refused gay couples and adoption agencies who refused to deal with gay couples .
Argumentative	 gay marriage has clear and tangible positive effects on societies where it is permitted .
Argumentative	 there are now ten countries that allow gay marriage , with no obvious or noticeable detriment to society at large .
Argumentative	 as chris ott reports from massachusetts , one of few us states to grant gay marriage rights , ` predictably , the sky has n't fallen ... ensuring equality does n't mean there 's less to go around for everyone else '.
Argumentative	 further to that , gay marriage encourages gay adoption , granting a home and a loving environment for an increasing number of orphaned or unwanted children worldwide .
Argumentative	 the evidence also suggests that gay parenting is ` at least as favourable ' as those in heterosexual families , eroding fears that the adopted children will be worse with gay parents.
Argumentative	 the economist thomas kostigen also argues gay marriage is a boost for the economy , ` weddings create revenue of all sorts ... even if a marriage does n't work out that helps the economy too .
Argumentative	 divorces cost money '.
Argumentative	 finally , and most simply , societies benefit from the net utility of their citizens , to allow and even encourage gay marriage ensures that those gay citizens wishing to celebrate their love are able to do so , in an environment conducive to their mutual happiness .

Argumentative	 kostigen ,  one of the last bastions of discrimination against gays lies in the fact that gay couples in many countries are at present not allowed to marry .
Argumentative	 such discrimination should be eradicated by permitting gay couples to marry as a means of professing their love to each other .
Argumentative	 the contemporary views of society ought to change with the times ; as recently as, blacks and whites in some americans could not marry , no-one would defend such a law now.
Argumentative	 gay marriage is possibly , as theodore olson , a former bush administration republican suggests , ` the last major civil-rights milestone yet to be surpassed' .
Argumentative	 to permit heterosexual couples to profess their love through the bonds of marriage , but deny that same right to homosexual couples ultimately devalues their love , a love that is no weaker or less valid than that of straight couples .
Argumentative	 as new york state senator mark grisanti admitted when voting in favour of abill , ` i can not deny a person ... the same rights that i have with my wife '.
Argumentative	 it is clearly discriminatory and reflects an out-dated view of homosexuality .
