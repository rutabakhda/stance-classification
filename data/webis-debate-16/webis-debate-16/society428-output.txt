Non-Argumentative	in 2007, eliot spitzer, governor of new york proposed that all illegal immigrants in his state should be allowed to obtain drivers licenses.
Non-Argumentative	 at the time, it was estimated that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 illegal immigrants were residing in new york state, most of them driving on the roads despite a lack of a driver’s license.
Non-Argumentative	 spitzer proposed that instead of needing an american social security number to get a driver’s license, new york would also accept a foreign passport as adequate identification to obtain a license.
Non-Argumentative	the move for giving illegal immigrants licenses is an issue that has arisen and re-arisen multiple times, especially in states with high illegal immigrant populations such as california.
Non-Argumentative	 however, american citizens are seemingly overwhelmingly against this policy with over 70% of new yorkers polling against this policy.
Non-Argumentative	 this creates a debate over what the impact of these licenses will be and how the public’s perception of this policy weighs up against these potential benefits.
Non-Argumentative	 currently, seven states in the us allow illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses: hawaii, maine, michigan, new mexico, oregon, utah and washington.
Argumentative	 offering drivers licenses to illegal immigrants makes the streets safer by giving drivers training to people who would otherwise be driving on the streets without adequate education .
Argumentative	 unlicensed drivers are five times more likely to get into a fatal crash than licensed drivers .
Argumentative	 a fact that needs to be acknowledged is that illegal immigrants have a necessity to drive and the vast majority will do so regardless of if they are given licenses or not .
Argumentative	 this is very dangerous both for them and for those who they share the road with as they are operating motor vehicles with a proper education on the rules of the road or any form of driving instruction or test to ensure that they can competently and safely drive on the streets .
Argumentative	 illegal immigrants are very likely to opt into this system of driver 's education and licensing because it is in their own interest to avoid breaking the law to avoid detection , but also because it is very much in their interest to get instruction on how to drive as they are as much a danger to themselves as they are to the rest of society when they drive without instruction .
Argumentative	 therefore , offering illegal immigrants driver 's licenses will help make the streets safer by giving drivers access to the education and instruction they need to be safe and competent drivers .
Argumentative	 insurance is a key component in making the streets safe for all drivers on the road .
Argumentative	 allowing illegal immigrants to get driver 's licenses allows them to gain driver 's insurance .
Argumentative	 driving absent insurance means that there is an incentive to drive off if you cause an accident to avoid having to pay for the damages you have caused and being criminally punished for driving without insurance .
Argumentative	 this leaves the other driver having to foot their own bill for the repairs to their vehicles .
Argumentative	 moreover , even if the uninsured driver stays at the scene , illegal immigrants are characteristically very poor as they must engage in exploitative work to make a wage because they must hide from the state and do not get the same protections from the state , so would still be unable to pay for the damages they have caused .
Argumentative	 moreover , having uninsured drivers on the road increases insurance premiums for all insured drivers on the road , as they have to de-facto pay for the risk and damage these uninsured drivers cause .
Argumentative	 therefore , offering illegal immigrants driver 's licenses allows for more fair and accountable systems of insurance and driving conditions on the road .
Argumentative	 drivers licenses are used a major form of identification in america and so granting illegal immigrants these forms of identification can help enfranchise one of the most exploited minorities in america .
Argumentative	 despite american feelings on illegal immigrants , they are there in their society , contribute to their communities and are a group of people that are routinely and unjustly exploited because of their lack of access to state protection .
Argumentative	 despite popular opinion of this being a punishment for breaking their laws , these people operate like any other citizen in american society and are human beings who deserve to be treated as such and to be offered at least some level of protection for the fact that they are human and for what they contribute to america communities and society .
Argumentative	 providing these people with a proper form of identification , especially a driver 's license , which is almost universally accepted as an adequate form of identification to access services from the state and to interact with the rest of society .
Argumentative	 specifically , this allows immigrant communities to not feel as though they are confined to an isolated area as they now can travel further distances to gain better employment without fear of being caught and thrown into jail .
Argumentative	 moreover , this allows them access to all services offered by the state that require identification such as voter registration .
Argumentative	 therefore , this helps enfranchise a group that is normally exploited in america society .
