Non-Argumentative	under the status quo in most english-speaking jurisdictions, a defendant’s previous convictions cannot be brought up in court until after the jury has given its verdict.
Non-Argumentative	 this includes scotland, america, canada, australia, new zealand and britain.
Non-Argumentative	 this is because these countries believe that each case should be evaluated on its own merits, and that ‘knowledge of previous offences would prejudice the outcome of a trial’.
Non-Argumentative	 however, other countries such as france allow previous convictions to be disclosed before a verdict is reached.
Non-Argumentative	 exceptions are made in britain in cases where the case under trial is ‘strikingly similar’ to a past offence, in which case it is believed that the value of the evidence ‘outweighs any prejudicial effect’.
Non-Argumentative	 previous convictions may also be disclosed if the defendant ‘falsely claims to be of good character’.
Non-Argumentative	 though previous convictions are not currently disclosed before the verdict of guilty or not guilty, judges may consider previous convictions when they decide the sentence for defendants deemed guilty.
Non-Argumentative	 there is a great interest in making sure that criminals are adequately punished for their crimes – particularly where recidivism shows that previous punishment has had little effect – in the interest of justice and public safety.
Non-Argumentative	                when choosing a mechanism for this debate, you may wish to think about the scope of argument and breadth of debate you want to have.
Non-Argumentative	 the first option is to defend a criminal justice system which allows previous convictions to be revealed in a case of similarity to past convictions, where the defendant falsely claims good character, or where the defendant attacks the character of a prosecution witness, as is the status quo in britain.
Non-Argumentative	 this takes on a smaller burden for the proposition and highlights particular points where past convictions could certainly be pertinent to the case and its relevance is pinpointed.
Non-Argumentative	 the other option is to defend the model used by france where previous convictions are routinely disclosed.
Non-Argumentative	 this requires the proposition to argue that the majority of cases would actively benefit from these disclosures by citing high recidivism rates after an initial offence and more general issues such as greater transparency within the courtroom.
Non-Argumentative	 this is a wider debate with more potential for principles, rather than practical, arguments.
Argumentative	 it is unfair that those who repeatedly re-offend should be treated in the same manner as those who have committed one offence ; a singular offence could mark a mistake or accident in the defendant 's choices , but repeated criminal acts mark a habit and a lack of regret for past crimes .
Argumentative	 failing to take past convictions into account can lead to many dangerous offenders being underestimated by the jury , and so released .
Argumentative	 this is particularly pertinent in cases of child molestation , where child molesters have a particularly high rate of re-offending -- expected to be even ` larger than the reportedper cent ' - but ` only a small proportion of sexual offences against children result in a conviction ' .
Argumentative	 this conviction rate , however , does rise for ` those with a history of prior sexual offences ' .
Argumentative	 under the current conditions , this system is unfairly weighted against the innocent victims of repeated crime .
Argumentative	 a higher conviction rate , informed by the knowledge of previous offences , helps to reach justice for these victims and their families , as well as promoting justice and the safety of the general public who find it frustrating that so many dangerous offenders are released without appropriate conviction .
Argumentative	 moreover , jurors themselves lose confidence in the justice system when they find out that they have just acquitted a defendant who has committed a similar crime before .
Argumentative	 one notable example of this was series of trials of kirk reid , who committed many sexual assaults against women including several instances of rape and who was ` wrongfully acquitted ' of his first offence in.
Argumentative	 not only did his victim lose all sense of hope in the justice system -- she had faced her attacked and been discredited -- but one of the jurors at the trial who believed that he was guilty went on to criticise the justice system itself .
Argumentative	 the current system seriously risks acquitting criminals who have already committed similar crimes ; it is time to rebalance the justice system to acknowledge the needs of the victims who suffer through wrongful acquittal of their attackers .
Argumentative	 it is nonsensical to withhold evidence from a jury that might be necessary for them to reach an accurate verdict .
Argumentative	 just because their verdict might be more prone to conviction rather than acquittal does not necessarily mean that this is an unfair or even inaccurate conclusion ; given that violent offenders are likely to re-offend , it may illuminate the truth rather than confuse it .
Argumentative	 jurors should be allowed to weigh the relevance of previous convictions and compare them with the accusations of the trail at hand .
Argumentative	 a criminal justice system which currently relies on the ability of the jury to make a decision can not legitimately choose to withhold evidence from them without innately biasing the trial itself .
Argumentative	 as the uk government 's white paper states , ` we want less evidence to be withheld from the courts , on the principle that relevant evidence should be admissible ... magistrates , judges and juries have the common sense to evaluate relevant evidence and should be trusted to do so ' .
Argumentative	 if we can not trust juries to decide which evidence is relevant to the verdict and which is not , then the entire use of juries in the criminal justice system should be reconsidered .
Argumentative	 jurors are frequently affected by media coverage of particular cases , which makes it almost impossible for them to remain impartial in the idealistic way which opposition naively believes possible .
Argumentative	 this creates a situation where the jury may be more affected by information which they have found out elsewhere -- for example on the news or in newspapers -- than the information which is presented to them in court .
Argumentative	 there have been some cases where jurors search the internet to find the backgrounds to their cases , despite the fact that this is not allowed .
Argumentative	 this evidently reflects that jurors feel that they have not been adequately informed and so seek facts elsewhere .
Argumentative	 given that this need has been reflected by the jurors themselves , the court should give jurors all possible information and bring previous convictions into the open to ensure that they can base their verdict on reliable fact presented in court rather than resorting to sensationalist media .
Argumentative	 this motion could allow innocent defendants to mount a stronger case .
Argumentative	 this is because , if allowed , the previous convictions of prosecution witnesses would be admitted as evidence .
Argumentative	 in this case , if a prosecution witness falsely claims good character in opposition to the defendant , any falsity could be more easily seen and weighed by the jury .
Argumentative	 this solves a problem under that status quo where ` the threat of introducing his , the defendant 's , previous convictions will frequently inhibit him from introducing character evidence about the prosecution witness ' ; fear that the defendant 's convictions may weigh against them where the prosecution witness remains untouchable creates a discrepancy in the justice system .
Argumentative	 however , if convictions on both sides were to be revealed anyway , then neither can falsely claim the character of the other and attempt to convince the jury of false information on this front .
Argumentative	 at present in britain , some previous convictions may be disclosed if they bear a striking resemblance to the case at trial , if the defendant falsely claims to be of good character , or if they attack the character of a prosecution witness .
Argumentative	 however , different judges invariable interpret these criteria in different ways , which leads to a wavering standard of trail where previous convictions may or may not be revealed .
Argumentative	 it would be much more efficient and transparent to allow this motion and make court procedures more accessible .
