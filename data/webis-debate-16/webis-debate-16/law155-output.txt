Non-Argumentative	assassination can be defined as the targeted killing of an individual for political reasons in peacetime.
Non-Argumentative	 it can be undertaken by individual citizens, or by the agents of another state, but in either case it takes place without any legal process.
Non-Argumentative	 assassinating a dictator is often considered in the context of hitler and stalin, or of secret cia action against foreign leaders such as fidel castro in the cold war period (after this became public knowledge in the mid-1970s us presidents have banned the use of assassination by executive order).
Non-Argumentative	 however, this issue regained topicality in the 1990s as leaders such as saddam hussein and slobodan milosevic pursued bloody careers which threatened international peace.
Non-Argumentative	 in recent years us airstrikes apparently aimed at killing muammar qaddafi of libya (1986), osama bin laden (1998) and saddam hussein (1991 and 2003) have provoked argument - were these assassination attempts or did these leaders have the status of enemy combatants in a time of war?
Non-Argumentative	 certainly the un charter (article 24) and various conventions (e.g new york convention) clearly appear to make assassination in peacetime against international law.
Argumentative	 proponents nevertheless argue that assassinations are necessary for the greater good of preventing civilian suffering.
Argumentative	the utilitarian justification for assassination lies in the many deaths and much suffering potentially prevented if just one man or woman is killed .
Argumentative	 the greater good demands a single evil act is done , especially if it would avert the immediate and certain danger of much worse evil .
Argumentative	 oppressive , tyrannical dictators who sustain their own power through fear have no legitimacy .
Argumentative	 who now would n't wish that hitler had been killed in?
Argumentative	 or pol pot in?
Argumentative	 the casualties directly inflicted as a result of their misguided policies could have been avoided .
Argumentative	 as a last resort therefore , assassination stands as a ` permissible means to a just end ', handing the reins of the state back to its oppressed population .
Argumentative	 armed invasions are costly events , in terms of the lives lost , the emotional trauma and the ever-widening hole created in the economy .
Argumentative	 assassination provides a means to accomplish the goals of a military campaign without having to put boots on the ground , removing the predominant obstacle to democratic reform or energy security .
Argumentative	 as angelo codevilla argues , ` the military art consists of striking those people and things most likely to stop the enemy from continuing the war '.
Argumentative	 as the gulf war demonstrated , often the quarrel is not with a state but its leader and it would be ` futile and immoral to demolish a country in the hope that this will persuade the tyrant to give way '.
Argumentative	 furthermore , ari fleischer , a spokesman in the bush administration when asked about the cost of a possible war with iraq , remarked ` the cost of a one-way ticket is substantially less than the cost of war ... the cost of one bullet , if the iraqi people take it on themselves , is substantially less than that '.
Argumentative	 this admission belies the bush administration 's belief that hussein 's assassination would allow them to accomplish their objectives without a prolonged ground campaign .

Argumentative	 pgdictators are a threat to international peace , not just their own people .
Argumentative	 their tendency to attack other countries in order to divert attention from their unpopular actions at home means that assassination is justified as a means of preventing a terrible war , which might rapidly become a regional or global conflict .
Argumentative	 a study by benjamin jones and benjamin olken inconcluded that ` assassinations of autocrats produce substantial changes in the country 's institutions '.
Argumentative	 if a tyrant comes to power by illegitimate , undemocratic means and directly suppresses , harms , and kills the citizens of a state , that tyrant loses all legitimacy to the continued occupation of office .
Argumentative	 if it is impossible to depose the leader by more subtle means of opposition and democratic voting , the only route to freedom may be assassination .
Argumentative	 in such cases , assassination is certainly justifiable , provided that as dietrich bonhoeffer points out , there exists a ` group capable of quickly occupying , or remaining in , the key organs of the totalitarian dictatorship '.
Argumentative	 the assassination of libyan dictator muammar gaddafi would undoubtedly lead to the installation of a democratic regime with the full backing of the libyan people , yet his fierce , paternal grip on the army prevents this from occurring .
