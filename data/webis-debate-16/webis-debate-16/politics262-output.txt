Non-Argumentative	this is not a cost benefit analysis of whether catalonia should remain within spain as catalonia despite how much many catalans may wish for a vote on independence has yet to get that far.
Non-Argumentative	 instead for the moment the much more urgent question is whether the catalans should get their vote on independence at all; the catalans clearly say yes while the spanish government and the other regions are firmly against.
Non-Argumentative	 once the issue of whether a referendum should be had is resolved and accepted by both sides, or the issue become less relevant by proposals of unilateral catalan moves towards independence then this debate may become irrelevant and one about the costs and benefits of full independence much more necessary.
Non-Argumentative	in the early part of the 15th century what is now spain was still divided politically, catalonia was a part of the kingdom of aragon rather than the kingdom of castile.
Non-Argumentative	 inthe territories of the two kingdoms were united in a personal union through the marriage of the king of aragon ferdinand ii and queen of castile isabella.
Non-Argumentative	 their grandson charles i (usually known as charles v outside spain as a result of being holy roman emperor) became the king of both territories in 1516.
Non-Argumentative	 however each region within the kingdoms maintained considerable autonomy; for example taxes had to be sought through each regions cortes rather than nationally and the catalans in particular were often unwilling to pay for what they saw as castile’s empire.
Non-Argumentative	during the war of spanish succession catalonia first recognised philip v and then turned to the other claimant archduke charles when he entered catalonia.
Non-Argumentative	 philip however won the war and kept the entirety of peninsular spain in the treaty of utrecht on 1713.
Non-Argumentative	 having been on the losing side catalonia had its constitution and independent political structure abolished, and its culture and language suppressed.
Argumentative	 ultimately despite being within spain so long as support for independence remains strong the catalans probably have more cards to play ; they provide more in taxes than they receive so could cut madrid off , or in the final play they could unilaterally secede leaving spain with the unpalatable option of either negotiating to get catalonia back in , accepting , or invading .
