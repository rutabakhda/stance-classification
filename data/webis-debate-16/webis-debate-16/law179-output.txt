Non-Argumentative	intellectual property (ip) is a legal field that refers to creations of the mind such as musical, literary, and artistic works; inventions; and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and related rights.
Non-Argumentative	 under intellectual property law, the holder of one of these abstract "properties" has certain exclusive rights to the creative work, commercial symbol, or invention by which it is covered, such as a limited monopoly on the sale of inventions and products of creative endeavour.
Non-Argumentative	 the idea of intellectual property is relatively new, the term itself was not used until the 19th century and the legal principles only date back to the british statute of anne inand statute of monopolies from 1623.
Non-Argumentative	 different countries have different systems of intellectual property rights so there is often conflict between countries with one countries property rights not being respected by another.
Non-Argumentative	 there has been some standardization through the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (trips) agreement that established minimum levels of protection for all world trade organization members.
Non-Argumentative	 the main question for the  issue of intellectual property hinges around whether it increases innovation and good business practice, as its defenders maintain, or whether it stifles these things by instituting unjust monopoly powers for the holders of intellectual property rights.
Argumentative	 however a broader issue of contention revolves around whether intellectual property is indeed a form of property, even though it is intangible in nature, or whether it is simply an invention and not a real form of property at all.
Argumentative	the state incurs huge costs in monitoring for intellectual property right infringement , in arresting suspected perpetrators , in imprisonment of those found guilty , even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that , once released to it , belonged to the public domain .
Argumentative	 the united states government , for example , projects costs of investigating intellectual property claims will cost $million betweenand.
Argumentative	 firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecuting offenders , all of which generates huge costs and little or no return2 .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the deterrent effect to intellectual property piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal .
Argumentative	 this is because in many cases intellectual property rights are next to unenforceable , as the music and movie industries have learned in recent years .
Argumentative	 only a tiny handful of perpetrators are ever caught , and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime , it does little to stop it .
Argumentative	 intellectual property , in many cases , simply does not work in practice ; firms should move with the times and recognize they need to innovate in ways that will compensate .
Argumentative	 an individual 's idea , so long as it rests solely in his mind or is kept safely hidden , belongs to him .
Argumentative	 when he disseminates it to everyone and makes it public , it becomes part of the public domain , and belongs to anyone who can use it .
Argumentative	 if individuals or firms want to keep something a secret , like a production method , then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product .
Argumentative	 one should not , however , expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one has , since no such ownership right exists1 .
Argumentative	 no one can own an idea .
Argumentative	 thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products .
Argumentative	 physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards .
Argumentative	 ideas do not share this right to protection , because an idea , once spoken , enters the public domain and belongs to everyone .
