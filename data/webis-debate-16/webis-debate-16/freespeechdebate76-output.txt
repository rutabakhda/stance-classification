Argumentative	- timothy garton ash views on issues such as abortion , women , and what constitutes an acceptable family expressed by those who are extremely religious are simply bigoted views which are given credibility by being wrapped in a cassock .
Argumentative	 it is in the nature of religious belief that any set of views can adopt a religious justification and there is no objective measure against which to hold the views .
Argumentative	 for example the homophobic views which have common currency in many churches can be contrasted with a gay liberation trend discernible in others .
Argumentative	 in the light of this , it makes sense to judge the views on their own basis , regardless of the religiosity surrounding them .
Argumentative	 the views expressed by harry hammond , and others , need to be stripped of their religious veneer and shown that at their heart they are simply offensive .
Argumentative	 there is absolutely no reason why lgbt people should have to endure vitriol and condemnation as they go about their daily lives .
Argumentative	 it is a useful exercise to consider how we would respond to a secular speaker saying that the actions of two people who were in love with each other should condemn them to torment and suffering .

Argumentative	 free speech must come second when there is the potential for that speech to cause harm .

Argumentative	 preventing hate speech helps prevent that violence from occurring so justifying restrictions on freedom of speech .
Argumentative	 homophobia is the last respectable prejudice and should be tackled with the same passion and force that others have been , and continue to be , confronted .
Argumentative	 if the speaker had been condemning black people or women they would have been arrested for public disorder if they represented an organisation that was overtly racist , it would be quite likely to be banned .
Argumentative	 for some reason churches that hold views on homosexuality that are comparable in their vitriol to those on race held by neo-nazi groups are not only tolerated but frequently supported by the state .
Argumentative	 hatred is hatred and there is no reason why homophobia should be given a free pass that would not be given to racism or sexism .
