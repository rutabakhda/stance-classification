Non-Argumentative	the universities of oxford and cambridge, sometimes known collectively as ‘oxbridge,’ have for many centuries been seen as the pinnacle of higher education, both within britain and across the globe.
Non-Argumentative	 yet for the eleven or so centuries they have been in existence, many claim, oxford and cambridge have been marked by exclusiveness as well as academic proficiency, with their high entry requirements and old-fashioned practices still favouring those from more privileged backgrounds and excluding, intentionally or otherwise, promising individuals from marginalised areas and difficult backgrounds.
Non-Argumentative	both universities demand that most candidates sit a series of two and three-day interviews, often accompanied by entrance examinations.
Non-Argumentative	 although demands have been placed on oxford and cambridge by previous british governments to admit higher numbers of students from poorer backgrounds, there is no doubt they are still made up largely of students from independent schools.
Non-Argumentative	oxbridge admissions tests often valorise a form of self confidence and an approach to acquiring knowledge that most state-school pupils aren’t coached in.
Non-Argumentative	 private schools, however, devote far more resources to preparing their pupils for the two universities’ entry systems.
Non-Argumentative	 many spend years gearing children up for the interview process, and so often produce people who can shine in the interview scenario, but aren’t necessarily the country’s brightest or those who have worked hardest.
Non-Argumentative	 it is often argued that 17-year-olds from comprehensives will rarely have had the same intensive training, and so the admissions process inevitably excludes many of the brightest but least well-off pupils.
Non-Argumentative	many from oxbridge go into high-powered jobs in politics, the media and the private sector, leading reformists to argue that the most influential circles of society remain the preserve of the wealthiest, yet not necessarily the most intelligent or able.
Non-Argumentative	 owen jones, the prominent blogger and polemicist, claims that merely carrying the ‘oxbridge’ stamp means candidates are assumed to be more intelligent than non-oxbridge counterparts.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore students from oxbridge are given priority in the market for jobs.
Non-Argumentative	 there is much to suggest that this diminishes the status comparatively of degrees gained by graduates at lower-ranking universities, and a result keeps them out of the best industries.
Non-Argumentative	 in academic fields, it has also been argued that oxbridge imposes a monopoly on knowledge, stultifying debate and harbouring an innate conservatism which means that research from ‘lesser’ universities are not given the same attention or weighting – a point which will be explored further in the substantive arguments below.
Non-Argumentative	  ‘reform’ in this context means the model proposed by owen jones.
Non-Argumentative	 the university buildings would be maintained, but many of oxbridge’s more arcane practices would be forcibly abolished.
Non-Argumentative	 interviews of the type that the university has previously conducted would be allowed only for courses like medicine, in-keeping with the practices of many other universities.
Non-Argumentative	quotas for pupils from state schools would be enforced as opposed to just recommended, with the universities required to reserve 80% of their places for the brightest state-school pupils.
Non-Argumentative	 this would be much closer to the proportion of private vs. state schooled pupils as state-educated pupils make up close to 93% of the school-age population.
Non-Argumentative	 oxford and cambridge would still be allowed to demand people achieve the highest grades possible to gain entrance, and given the high level of demand that exists per place at each of the universities it should still be possible for both to only take in students of the highest academic calibre.
Non-Argumentative	it cannot be ignored that a potential exodus of good teaching and research staff could occur if the universities were to be changed so radically.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore pay incentives would be offered to prevent top academic staff from leaving over fears about the implications of the proposed changes.
Non-Argumentative	 the universities would be allowed a five-year changeover period in which to implement the reforms.
Argumentative	 the current oxbridge system is , by its very nature , unequal and elitist .
Argumentative	 the entrance exam and lengthy system of interviews are far more suited to schools that have the resources to prepare their children for them .
Argumentative	 passing the interviews requires a staggering degree of innate talent or years of training in productive academic techniques such as debate , critical thought and the ability to read and research independently .
Argumentative	 this is an approach to education which schools in deprived areas , trying to motivate kids from sometimes very difficult backgrounds , do not have the time or money to take up .
Argumentative	 this was shown recently by a report from the office of fair access , which stated that the proportion of students from low-income families , defined by offa as those from families with an income of less than #,per annum , admitted by the universities has dropped since.
Argumentative	 the brightest individuals are therefore kept out of the best institutions -- a situation which dampens aspirations among the majority of britain 's school-children and maintains a harm , in that those with the greatest potential and the strongest work ethic do not have an equal chance of being admitted to oxford or cambridge .
Argumentative	 the high number of students at oxbridge who went to public school has meant that what is colloquially known as ` the old boy network ' has prevailed .
Argumentative	 oxford and cambridge for example have always held a grip on the highest offices withofbritish pms having attended oxford or cambridge .
Argumentative	 as in turn those who attend oxbridge are nearly all privileged this ensures the most influential circles of society remain the preserve of the wealthiest , yet not necessarily the most intelligent or able .
Argumentative	 this is harmful to society at large , as it means industries are not absorbing the best that the country has to offer from all levels of society -- only those who are rich enough to get in .
Argumentative	 the negative effects that a lack of diversity in key industries can have include the discouraging image given to young people from poorer economic backgrounds , dampening the aspirations of those whose families are not rich .
Argumentative	 furthermore , industries such as the media , banking and the civil service are not profiting from recruiting talent from every level , hampering the potential of these sectors to be as productive as they can be .
