Non-Argumentative	english is the language of the superpower that is america, the internet and of computers.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore, it is not uncommon to see and hear european languages laden with anglicisms.
Non-Argumentative	 this english influence over french words is known as franglais.
Non-Argumentative	 this word itself is a fusion of français and anglais, the french words for french and english.
Non-Argumentative	 examples of this franglais are le parking (car park), un walkman (as opposed to the french term un balladeur) and un post-it (a post-it note).
Non-Argumentative	 other european languages have been similarly affected by english.
Non-Argumentative	 the german, spanish and welsh counterparts of franglais are known as deuglish, spanglish and wenglish.
Non-Argumentative	franglais is that breed of french words that are heavily influenced by the english language; faire le shopping (translated literally means to do shopping) is commonly used instead of faire les magasins (translated literally means to do the shops).
Non-Argumentative	 un relooking is used for make over and is a franglais term which has not been established by simply importing an english word into french and leaving it unchanged, such as le fast food.
Non-Argumentative	 instead, rather creatively, un relooking has been created using the tools of english phraseology to form a word that does not even exist in english!
Non-Argumentative	 in french, this prevalence of english influences is perhaps no greater than in other european languages, but is doubtless met with more animosity.
Non-Argumentative	 in march 2006, the then french president jacques chirac addressed the eu in english.
Non-Argumentative	 this move was not only met with great hostility from the french public, it prompted a walkout protest from the french ministers in attendance.
Non-Argumentative	 they doubtless labelled this an act of anglo-snobberie, (sic) the french derogatory term for franglais, practiced only by anglosnobs (sic).
Non-Argumentative	 this would certainly be the view taken by defense de la langue française, a body which wants to eliminate the use of franglais and to promote the french language.
Non-Argumentative	is the franglais a playful use of words or is it an erosion of the french language?
Non-Argumentative	 does the state have the right to tell the individual which lexicon they may and may not use?
Non-Argumentative	 is franglais simply a counterpart to the anglophone use of gallicisms?
Non-Argumentative	 languages change and have always changed; is it futile to try and intervene with such a natural occurrence?
Non-Argumentative	 or do these views turn a blind eye to the emotive issue of protecting the french language from absorbing too much english?
Non-Argumentative	 it is surely necessary to further protect the french language in light of anglicisms by handing more power to the défense de a langue française.
Non-Argumentative	 this move would increase the protection of the french language.
Non-Argumentative	 the défense de la languae française has the power to set and increase the quota of french language songs played on the radio at peak hours and to think up alternative, more french-sounding words for technological appliances tht are generally known by their english names even in french homes.
Non-Argumentative	 such measures would stop the anglo influence that reigns on the french language, seemingly through new technology and modern equipment.
Non-Argumentative	 in order to really protect the french language against english influences, this issue of language protection will have to be promoted.
Non-Argumentative	  that is to say, the french people must be in sympathy with it to a certain degree already.
Argumentative	 however, if the use of anglicisms is so great because the french are happy using english –influenced language, is this a complete waste of time?
Argumentative	franglais has connotations of english and french conflict such as the norman conquest and the hundred years ' war and is a mark of disrespect and impertinence towards the french .
Argumentative	 therefore , for the french culture to be immersed in this is ridiculous and immoral and the french people deserve to have their language protected against it .
Argumentative	 for example , as explained by nicholas ridley , winston churchill addressed general de gaulle during the second world war with an unrefined franglias-ridden threat ; `` monsieur le general , markez vous mes mots .
Argumentative	 si vous me doublecrosserez , je vous liquidaterai '' , sic !
Argumentative	 , in this quotation , which is not standard french , winston churchill made up the ` french ' words and phraseology by taking english words and applying french grammar endings thereto in order to be rude ; he was using franglais to embarrass the french .
Argumentative	 therefore , the increased protection of the french language is necessary so that the english terminology that carries with it connotations of derision against the french be dissolved .
Argumentative	 how a people see the world is encased in the words they use to communicate with each other and the words they use to write songs , poems and stories about their people 's history and experiences .
Argumentative	 culture is inseparable from language .
Argumentative	 for example , the ` e ' on the end of a word that is silent in everyday speech becomes pronounced in french poetry and song when it figures on the end of a line , thus adding an extra syllable to that line , and so `` femme '' on the end of a line of poetry would not be pronounced `` fam '' , but `` fam-mer '' , and so an extra syllable results .
Argumentative	 this principal also helps to create more rhymes within the poetry and song .
Argumentative	 therefore , in order to keep the french culture alive , we must too protect its home language from falling to the globally dominant language of english .
Argumentative	 this is why we need an increased awareness and presence of francophone art ; higher quotas of francophone songs on the radio and the same of francophone programmes on television .
Argumentative	 these two examples demonstrate how the culture itself can be better protected when the language is better upheld .
Argumentative	 there are four levels of french language .
Argumentative	 in descending order of formality these are ; précieux , snobby , poetic , soutenu , literary , written , courant , public , administrative , familier , informal language , non-standard popular terms , argotique , very informal language , offensive if used in the wrong context or said to a stranger .
Argumentative	 `` the middle ages , ninth century -- fifteenth century ... , saw , the emergence of a new standard language , replacing latin . ''
Argumentative	 since french - if not began , at least ` grew up ' - it has functioned with these four levels of formality .
Argumentative	 franglais is not standard french , although many franglais nouns , un post-it , un walkman , would be acceptable in a formal context , and its presence , uprising and prevalence threatens the use and survival of the more formal versions of the language .
Argumentative	 it is important that the french people are not seduced by the english language but instead know their mother tongue properly and can appreciate and understand these four levels .
Argumentative	 the acceptance of franglais and anglicisms within the french language means there could well be a whole generation of french whose mother tongue is punctuated and littered with anglicisms .
Argumentative	 if english influences are allowed to prevail in the french language , then soon any linguist who writes about the french language will only be able to see it in relation to the english language that influences it ; and not as a language in its own right with those four differing levels of formality .
Argumentative	 if the french language is protected , it will not only be protected against english but against becoming degraded into a language littered with wrong usage ; good french will be upheld and defended against bad french .
Argumentative	 the french often call the use of franglais `` anglo snobberie '' and those who use it as opposed to the standard version of their mother tongue `` anglo snobs '' .
Argumentative	 this is why the organisation defense de la langue française , dlf , exists -- to invent terminology that prevents the french language from embracing yet more franglais .
Argumentative	 the movement supports the use of such words as un balladeur as opposed to un walkman .
Argumentative	 défense de la langue française also regulates the quota of francophone songs that must be played at peak listening hours on french radio stations .
Argumentative	 public opinion must be taken into account ; the french do express opposition to the anglicising of their language and so the défense de la langue française must be brought into effect , for this is the purpose it seeks to serve and it exists to solve these very problems .
Argumentative	 the french language can not realistically survive if is not upheld as a relevant and respected language in official contexts .
Argumentative	 it is a very emotive and sensitive issue for the french people .
Argumentative	 the eu was founded by a frenchman , robert schuman , france and germany were two of the five founding members , the union was created to ally france with germany and before britain joined , the french vetoed britain 's entry .
Argumentative	 now , the french feel their part is europe is becoming diluted by the use of english .
Argumentative	 by forcing them to accept the english language in the context of an eu meeting only opens the gate to making them accept the same rules as other nations ; if their own language is silenced , so too is their voice of expression and opposition .
Argumentative	 the following example demonstrates the reality of the threat to the french language being used correctly in formal contexts .
Argumentative	 in march  the then french prime minister jacques chirac shocked and appalled his people by making an address to the european union in english .
Argumentative	 french representatives present walked out in protest .
Argumentative	 the times reported in franglais and somewhat comically on the predominance of english in the union ; `` ils s ' adresseraint l’union européenne cinq fois every day en franglais '' , sic !
Argumentative	 .
Argumentative	 when translated from franglais into english , it reads they address the european union every day in franglais .
Argumentative	 the article implies that franglais has overtaken standard français as the accepted means of french communication within the european union .
Argumentative	 it is time for more language protection through active measures by the french government and défense de la langue française took the matter of defending the french language seriously , and so the measures of increased exposure to french language songs , television shows and films is necessary , as are more french -- sounding nouns for referring to modern inventions which are generally just known by their english names in france .
