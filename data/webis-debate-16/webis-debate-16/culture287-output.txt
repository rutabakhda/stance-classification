Non-Argumentative	despite the fact that the particular circumstances of government funding for the arts will vary from country to country and should be researched carefully, the principles for this debate remain universal.
Non-Argumentative	 in an age of global economic difficulty the fundamental question is whether or not public money in any form should subsidise arts projects which are not self-sufficient.
Non-Argumentative	 in looking at this question, 'the arts' as a term should include museums and galleries as well as theatre, literature, music and film - all of these things are currently supported by government funding in the uk.1 as well as looking at whether or not these projects should receive any money at all, there is also the question of what form of subsidy these projects should take - for example, is funding via a state lottery more acceptable than direct grants from the national treasury?
Non-Argumentative	 ultimately any decision will be based in no small part on how far each individual values the concept of cultural output over more pragmatically valuable areas - whether or not people feel that in the modern world it is justifiable to use the limited resources available to not only foster new artistic projects, but also to protect the cultural heritage of the past.
Non-Argumentative	 there is a natural comparison within this question between the european and american systems.
Non-Argumentative	 in europe the majority of funding comes from government grants, where as in america there is a more competitive atmosphere in which projects must win favour with wealthy citizens and businesses who donate private funds.
Non-Argumentative	 even in the united states some money is given by the federal government through the national endowment for the arts which gave $139million in 2010.2 the director of the tate modern, sir nicholas serota, argues that "the key is the american culture of giving.
Argumentative	 people who have made money there are expected to give some of it back to society"3 it has however been suggested that it would be impossible to implement such a system in europe,4 and if that is indeed the case, the emphasis must shift to how far that system could reinforce the established governmental policies in europe.
Argumentative	if we accept the term ` arts ' to cover museums , galleries , theatres and musical and film projects , then it is clear that without public funding in many countries a large proportion of arts organisations would be lost .
Argumentative	 taking the uk as a prime example of what happens when funding for the arts is cut , we can see that of thecompanies which applied for funding from arts council england inonlywere successful .
Argumentative	 a cut of # 100m has meant this number has dropped from theorganisations that were granted funding in the previous application process1 .
Argumentative	 the arts council is responsible for the funding of cultural venues , theatres , galleries and performing arts groups , and this cut to its budget demonstrates the depth of repercussions that occur when the arts cease to be subsidised .
Argumentative	 there is also evidence to suggest that the american system of philanthropic donations simply does n't work in the uk , as investment in the arts by the business sector was shown in figures released in januaryto have fallen by%.

Argumentative	 since the lottery began in britain in1994 over #billion has been given to ` good causes ' .
Argumentative	 last year  16.67 % of the donations made were to arts organisations , the same amount that was given to sport and heritage projects1 .
Argumentative	 this money makes up an significant part of many organisation 's budgets , and stopping this funding whilst still giving to sports and heritage foundations would be discriminatory and unfair .
Argumentative	 equal distribution of this public lottery is the only way to ensure that people are being fairly treated when they buy their lottery ticket , even though the ` good causes ' their money goes to may not be their primary concern .
Argumentative	 1the national lottery , accessed 31/5/11 .
Argumentative	 the reduction in available services would make arts less accessible to all , and although the demand would still be there , forcing companies to ensure they make a profit will drive ticket prices up and prevent those from poorer backgrounds from being able to enjoy the same cultural experiences as those who are wealthy .
Argumentative	 subsidy can ensure that cheaper tickets are available and that the arts remain democratically open to all , regardless of income or social class .
Argumentative	 it also allows other public institutions which have similar economic problems such as schools and colleges to provide better services for their students , giving them access to better teaching resources and therefore a better quality of education .1 it would be unfair and inaccurate to assume that the benefits of arts subsidy only go to the wealthy elite , as the focus is on providing arts projects for all members of society .
Argumentative	 free and cheap access to the arts is crucial for education .
Argumentative	 without subsidy schools and young people would not be able to take affordable music lessons , visit museums or galleries , or to attend plays or concerts , and would thereby be prevented from understanding and enjoying their culture fully .
Argumentative	 as well as being important for personal enrichment , access to the arts also makes the young aware of their cultural heritage both nationally and in world terms , increasing the likelihood of continued interest in the arts and its creation in the future .
