Non-Argumentative	in the united kingdom, the percentage of children who have had already at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination by their second birthdays was 88.2 % in– 2010.
Non-Argumentative	 a much higher number than in 2008-2009 (84.9 %) or in 2003-2004 (79.9 %).
Non-Argumentative	 the who (world health organization) suggests, that for a successful protection of the community% of children need to have the jab.
Non-Argumentative	vaccines represent one of the most successful and effective interventions in medicine and a lucrative business opportunity for many pharmaceutical companies.
Non-Argumentative	 by vaccinating people, society has been able to eradicate numerous diseases that caused millions of deaths before.
Non-Argumentative	a dramatic example is smallpox, which was responsible for some of the most formidable epidemics of humankind.
Non-Argumentative	 init was the cause ofmillion deaths; a decade later it was totally eradicated from the planet by a concerted global vaccination program.
Non-Argumentative	 many countries have thus made it compulsory for people to be vaccinated against various diseases.
Non-Argumentative	as ofchildren in the us, australia, spain and greece must have proof of vaccination before entering the public school system, although it is becoming easier in many states for parents to gain exemptions from this requirement.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk there is no such requirement (currently).
Non-Argumentative	prior to a vaccine for polio, between 13,000 and 20,000 cases were reported in the usa annually.
Non-Argumentative	 in 1988, the world health organization decided to try and eradicate polio worldwide with vaccination, and as of today, the disease has been removed from the usa, western pacific and europe.
Non-Argumentative	 only four countries (afghanistan, nigeria, india and pakistan) are endemic, and there are justcases reported worldwide annually as of 2009.
Non-Argumentative	but by stopping vaccination before the disease is widely eradicated leaves countries susceptible to future unexpected outbreaks.
Non-Argumentative	 another common disease – measles, affected nearly everyone in the united states prior to the vaccination being introduced.
Non-Argumentative	 betweenand 1963, there weredeaths each year from the disease.
Non-Argumentative	 currently in the us, three of everypeople who contract measles will die, whilst in the developing world, one inwill die.
Non-Argumentative	 it is estimated that 90% of people who are exposed to the virus will get infected if not vaccinated against it.
Non-Argumentative	 inaccording to the who, there were 900,000 measles related deaths worldwide.
Non-Argumentative	 measles can spread rapidly amongst unvaccinated populations, and if vaccinations were stopped, the who estimate there could be 2.7 million measles related deaths worldwide annually.
Non-Argumentative	type b meningitis was prior to the vaccine the most common form of bacterial meningitis in us infants, with 20,000 annual cases, with one inproving either fatal or leaving the child with some form of disability.
Non-Argumentative	 since the vaccine became available in 1987, the number of cases has reduced by 98%, with fewer than ten fatalities a year.
Non-Argumentative	 these are just a few examples of how vaccines can prevent and eradicate diseases that have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths throughout the past century.
Non-Argumentative	 although some may argue that with diseases such as polio wiped out in most of the world a vaccine is not necessary.
Non-Argumentative	 however any reduction in the number of people vaccinated against the disease would leave a window of opportunity for the disease to rear its head up once again.
Non-Argumentative	even though benefits are much greater if everyone is vaccinated than if not, some people choose not to be vaccinated, and have concerns about certain vaccines.
Non-Argumentative	 simultaneously the number of people vaccinated rose as did the movements against the notion of compulsory vaccination, such as the society of anti vaccinations (1798) and the anti- vaccination league (1853).
Non-Argumentative	there should be as few obstacles as possible to such a program in order to save as many lives as possible.
Non-Argumentative	 some might argue that, that the government should not be able to force someone to have a needle stuck into them?
Non-Argumentative	 they might also say that if they wish to take the risk of not having the vaccine that is their choice.
Non-Argumentative	 however many claim, that because the risks do not just affect them, but the people around them, people should not be allowed to choose vaccines on their own.
Non-Argumentative	  so, this essentially this debate boils down to personal liberty vs. the good of the entire society.
Argumentative	 if an age group is protected , that results in a better health conditions for the whole society .
Argumentative	 in an industrialized country such as the usa , those choosing exemption from statutorily compulsory vaccination were 35-times more likely to contract measles than vaccinated persons ; in developing countries where these viruses are still endemic , the risk would be considerably higher .
Argumentative	 those who wish to opt-out of vaccination , often on behalf of their children , who have no say in the matter , are classic free riders , hoping to benefit from the more responsible behavior of the rest of society .
Argumentative	 as it is assumed that most of society see it as a responsibility and a duty to protect others .
Argumentative	 after a scare about possible side effects of the mmr jab , inthere was a drop in voluntary vaccinations in a part of london , lewisham .
Argumentative	 in that part of london only 64.3 % of children were vaccine and in that year the district accounted one third of all south-east london measles cases .
Argumentative	 unless there is a% vaccination , there is a great threat to public health of infection outbreaks .
Argumentative	 it is therefore the role of the state to understand these issues and possible treats and provide a duty of protection and care , in this case , in the form of immunization .
Argumentative	 another example of the need to protect is also given by the example of voluntary vaccination against the flu , because of its impacts on the whole population is given by pediatric studies : '' in several studies , results indicated that a% vaccination rate among health care personnel in acute care settings triggered a% decline in risk of influenza among patients .
Argumentative	 this decrease appeared even higher --% -- among nursing home patients . ''
Argumentative	 so by giving up some of the individuals freedoms and the feeling of duty to protection , the community is much more protected and benefits from the vaccination of the community .
Argumentative	 as articleof the united nations convention on the rights of the child states , `` state parties shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to health services . ''
Argumentative	 each year millions of children worldwide die of preventable diseases before the age of five .
Argumentative	 the argument presented here is that the state needs to protect the child and immunize him or her from preventable diseases as obviously the child does not have the capabilities at this stage to make informed decisions of their own .
Argumentative	 the united nations right to liberty and security of the person treaty , article 6.2 supports this view - state parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child .
Argumentative	 it is up to the state to decide if a child is to be immunized , as overall it will be the state who would benefit from having the vast majority of its citizens vaccinated , and it will be the state who will have to pay for any treatment needed to treat a preventable disease .
Argumentative	 whilst a child 's parents have to a certain degree the right to decide what is best for their child 's future , poor decision making in this area could result in serious medical issues for the nation .
Argumentative	 in this extremely important area , the state must have authority over the rights of the parent .
Argumentative	 commonly-used vaccines are a cost-effective and preventive way of promoting health , compared to the treatment of acute or chronic disease .
Argumentative	 in the u.s. during the year, routine childhood immunizations against seven diseases were estimated to save over $billion per birth-year cohort in overall social costs including $billion in direct health costs , and the societal benefit-cost ratio for these vaccinations was estimated to be 16.5 billion .
Argumentative	 another aspect is also , that productivity rates remain high and less money is earmarked for social and health transfers because people are healthier .
Argumentative	 this is also supported by a who study , that claims : `` we calculate that the average percentage increase in income for the children whose immunization coverage increases through will rise from 0.78 per cent into 2.39 per cent by.
Argumentative	 this equates to an increase in annual earnings per child of $by.
Argumentative	 the total increase in income per year once the vaccinated cohort of children start earning will rise from $million into $ 1.34 billion by, at a cost of $million inand $million in. ''
Argumentative	 this study based on economic and health indicators is part of the world immunization program gavi .
