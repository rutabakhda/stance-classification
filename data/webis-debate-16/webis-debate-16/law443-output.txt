Non-Argumentative	democratic states, while all aiming to uphold justice through a fair trial, have different approaches to the trials themselves.
Non-Argumentative	 in the united states, well-publicised criminal trials can be televised, or documentaries can later portray the court proceedings.
Non-Argumentative	 one notable example of this is the case of o.j simpson.
Non-Argumentative	 however, in france, the media is not allowed to show the face of any suspect who has not yet been found guilty - and the french were outraged that american media showed dominique strauss-kahn’s face before his trial began.
Non-Argumentative	 the dutch justice system allows the press to refer to the accused, but only by their ‘first names and last initials’.
Non-Argumentative	 all of this indicated that the justice system is not a matter of black-and-white interpretation, but it very sensitive to change.
Non-Argumentative	 those who oppose televised court cases argue that it only serves to make court cases theatrical, often focusing more on entertainment factor, or the lawyers and judges involved (particularly in the o.j simpson trial), than achieving justice for its own sake.
Non-Argumentative	 televising court cases can bring a huge amount of public attention, whether overwhelming sympathy for the victim-figure, or hatred for the accused.
Non-Argumentative	            a conventional proposition case would argue that the whole court proceedings would be recorded by cameras around the courtroom.
Non-Argumentative	 the faces of the jurors would not be shown (to try and avoid distorted verdicts).
Non-Argumentative	 however, this in itself leans towards an admission that televising court cases could distort justice.
Non-Argumentative	 the proposition would most likely exclude cases involving national security, or other cases where the presence of an audience is already limited, such as cases involving children.
Non-Argumentative	 it is already recognised that this information is too sensitive for public viewing; a prop line that acknowledges this is much easier to defend and falls into standards which are already in place.
Argumentative	 given that people are already allowed to watch court proceedings from the public gallery -- including the judicial committee of the house of lords in the uk , and the supreme court in the us -- there is little reason why this should not be extended to give better access across the nation to anybody who wants to watch .
Argumentative	 those with full-time jobs or who live far away from the courts are currently unfairly limited in this respect , and those who do wish to attend well-publicised trials often have to arrive hours in advance to get a seat .
Argumentative	 individuals should not have to give up so much time and money just to be able to watch a democratic proceeding , which is a cornerstone of democratic nations .
Argumentative	 given that many closed trials such as the trial of the guantánamo bay terrorism suspects have still led to intense media coverage , we would be better off showing the courts to be transparent and just instead of vainly trying to hide everything behind closed doors .
Argumentative	 it 's difficult for people to have faith in a system which is normally hidden from them .
Argumentative	 as long as the court proceedings themselves are hidden , the public and the media will continue to judge the judiciary based on unfortunate comments , or comments taken out of context , by judges .
Argumentative	 this means that the legal system becomes distorted and confusing in the public eye .
Argumentative	 televising trials would dispel this image by proving the competence , efficiency and sensitivity of most judges in the legal system , and restore faith in it as a whole .
Argumentative	 if these cameras were introduced , then the public would have something to measure media sensationalism against .
Argumentative	 instead of relying on journalistic evidence , the public would be able to literally see for themselves how the judge acted , and how the victim and defendant appeared .
Argumentative	 in, the case of chandler vs florida proved that cameras could operate in courtrooms which ` did not inherently violate due process ' while improving the transparency of courtrooms to the general public .
Argumentative	 cameras in the courtroom will prevent the public from being misled about the court proceedings .
Argumentative	 if the defendant is convicted of a crime , they have a right to appeal in the uk and us .
Argumentative	 however , this is made difficult for another court to re-assess the conviction if they can not know how reliable evidence was in the first trial .
Argumentative	 without film recordings of court trials , judges who have the duty to re-examine the case are unable to see witness testimonies ; though new evidence does sometimes come to light during the course of an appeal , it would be easier to assess this new evidence if the judges also had knowledge of how the first trial went .
Argumentative	 if the judges could watch a video of the first trial , they could judge the demeanour , body language and general impression given by each witness in the first trial .
Argumentative	 body language can affect a court 's perception of a witness , but this information could not be gained by a transcript .
Argumentative	 however , this evidence may be important for a new verdict to be reached .
Argumentative	 placing cameras into courtrooms encourages the judiciary and lawyers to increase their efficiency and have high standards of behaviour , because they are aware that it will be carried outside of the courtroom by public viewing .
Argumentative	 the introductions of cameras to the houses of parliament in the uk resulted in significantly improved standards of debate , greater punctuality , and greater attendance of mps .
Argumentative	 we can expect this same principle to continue in courtrooms when cameras are put in place .
