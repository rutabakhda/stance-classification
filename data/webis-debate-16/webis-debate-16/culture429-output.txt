Non-Argumentative	 with the on-going media coverage of ill-treated children in chinese and romanian orphanages and the increasing numbers of infertile couples in the developed world, proponents of international adoption claim it appears to solve two problems at once.

Non-Argumentative	 despite these difficulties international adoptions by us citizens have tripled in the pastyears and legislation has been passed to make it easier for these adopted children to obtain citizenship.
Non-Argumentative	 the numbers of international adoptions now reach as many as 45,000 worldwide.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents argue however that some children complain of a feeling of cultural dislocation and reject claims such cases are exceptions to the general sentiment of delight with their new homes and dual identity.
Argumentative	 the long-term effects of such migrations are hard to predict but many opponents call for more efforts to be made to house children in their country of birth, with proper support for domestic orphanages and adoption schemes.
Argumentative	couples who have made the decision to adopt a child should not be restricted in their choice to their country of residence .
Argumentative	 it may be in the state 's interest to reduce the number of children in their own institutions , however there is no reason citizens should be straddled with this obligation .
Argumentative	 we do not prevent our adults from marrying foreign nationals and granting them citizenship ; why would we do so for children ?
Argumentative	 furthermore , if the conditions of the couples ' state 's institutions are fairly good , they have a strong altruistic motive to adopt from a nation which does not fund its own institutions similarly .
Argumentative	 unwanted or orphaned children living in squalid conditions in the developing world should be the priority for couples seeking to adopt , not those living in the local orphanage who , whilst hoping for a permanent home , will not starve .
Argumentative	 international adoption therefore would provide a small but tangible means of reducing the infant mortality of many of these struggling states .
