Non-Argumentative	sincethe people’s republic of china has pursued a population control policy that limits all families in china’s largest provinces (with some exceptions), to no more than one child.
Non-Argumentative	 the chinese government introduced the policy to alleviate social and environmental problems that it had determined to be a result of over population.
Non-Argumentative	 the policy is controversial both within and outside china for a variety of reasons.
Non-Argumentative	many consider child-birth to be a sacred, inalienable right of citizens.
Non-Argumentative	 others worry about the economic and social consequences of a policy that will create a more aged population.
Non-Argumentative	 the policy is enforced at the provincial level through fines that are imposed based on the income of the family and other factors.
Non-Argumentative	 however, there are still many citizens that continue to have more than one child.
Non-Argumentative	 in april of 2010, a new chinese census showed that the population, the world's largest, rose to 1.34 billion as of last year, from 1.27 billion in 2000.
Non-Argumentative	 this put its average annual growth at 0.57% over the decade, down from 1.07 per cent in 1990-2000.
Non-Argumentative	 it also showed that people over the age ofnow account for 13.3 per cent of china's population, compared to 10.3% in 2000.
Non-Argumentative	 its reserve of future workers also dwindled; with people undernow make up 16.6% of the population, down from 23%years ago.
Argumentative	 all of this sparked renewed  subject.11 page, jeremy, “china’s one-child plan faces new fire”, the wall street journal,april 2011, the one child policy is often strictly enforced in china and many parents are given information about contraception to prevent any chance of an unplanned pregnancy .
Argumentative	 however a large number of pregnancies - within any population - are inevitable , despite the precautions that parents may take .
Argumentative	 whether as a result of defective medication , irresponsible behaviour , or simple bad luck , sufficiently frequent sexual activity will always lead to pregnancy .
Argumentative	 reports from human rights workers indicate that the chinese states deals with such eventualities by forcing women to have abortions against their will .
Argumentative	 by some accounts , the state directly detains and punishes women who resist family planning policies .1 the psychological trauma caused by this is almost indescribable .
Argumentative	 not only does a forced abortion represent a significant attack on a woman 's bodily autonomy , procedures of this type are officially contextualised as correcting the results of wrongdoing .
Argumentative	 the woman is not counselled or assured that she is not morally culpable for her actions ; she is placed in a position where the destruction of her foetus is portrayed as the inevitable result of her own lack of responsibility .
Argumentative	 chinese women are made to feel directly responsible for the loss of their unborn children or for the circumstances that gave rise to their pregnancy .
Argumentative	 further the chinese authorities often force people to be sterilised against their will .
Argumentative	 this has happened in some cases almost immediately after birth , which is incredibly traumatic for the people involved .
Argumentative	 further , should these people ever leave china it prevents them from raising a family in the future with more than a single child .
Argumentative	 again , forced sterilisation in this way causes large psychological harms due to the manner in which the person 's body is violated .2 many asian cultures have a preference for sons over daughters due to traditions involving inheritance .
Argumentative	 further , in rural communities a son is often preferable to a daughter simply because of the amount of work that they can do for the family .
Argumentative	 as well as this , sons act as primary caregivers for the parents when they go into retirement and the son 's parents are often treated better than the daughter 's .
Argumentative	 it is for these reasons that often when a chinese family finds out that they are set to have a daughter they attempt to selectively abort it and try again for a son .
Argumentative	 this is technically illegal in china , however , this has only led to back alley abortions which often carry a much higher chance of mortality for the mother .
Argumentative	 further , it has also led to parents abandoning female children or leaving them to starve so that they may try again with a son .
Argumentative	 in china 's rural provinces it is much more difficult for the authorities to deal with every case given the sheer number of people over such a large area and as such these crimes often go unprosecuted or punished .
Argumentative	 this process not only leads to human rights violations , as mentioned , but it also skews the gender balance of the chinese population .
Argumentative	 specifically , since the implementation of the policy inmany men are finding there are simply no women to marry .
Argumentative	 byit is estimated there will bemillion men unable to marry in china simply because of the lack of females .1 the one child policy is a policy that can be ignored fairly easily by richer people within china .
Argumentative	 through their ability to bribe officials as well as their ability to hide extra children using foster parents and the like , it is easily possible for richer people to flout the one child policy .
Argumentative	 this has shown itself in the form of many wealthy chinese officials , entrepreneurs and celebrities who have been caught ignoring the one child policy .
Argumentative	 for example betweenand1968 government officials in hunan violated the one child policy .1 given that this is true , the one child policy serves to create social division in china .
Argumentative	 it is perceived by the poorest chinese communities as an obstacle to prosperity .
Argumentative	 by imposing harsh penalties , both moral and fiscal , on parents who attempt to maximise not only their future welfare , but also their family 's economic prosperity by trying for a son , the one child policy undermines social development within china 's rural and working classes .
Argumentative	 moreover , it serves to entrench negative perceptions of chinese officials and business owners as corrupt tyrants .
Argumentative	 how else will marginalised communities relate to a law that undermines the cohesion of their families and that the wealthy can exempt themselves from ?
