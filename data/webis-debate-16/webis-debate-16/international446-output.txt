Non-Argumentative	the european coal and steel community, the organisation that eventually became the european union, was primarily created in order to help keep the peace in europe following world war ii by sharing the vital war making materials of coal and steel.
Non-Argumentative	 similarly one of the reasons for the creation of the euro was to help maintain peace.
Non-Argumentative	 former chancellor of germany helmut kohl argued that joining a political union improves the prospects for peace by “containing a potentially dangerous germany within europe.”
Non-Argumentative	 it is certainly true that the european union has played a role in maintaining peace in europe, although many would argue that nato has made as important, if not more so, a contribution to this.
Non-Argumentative	 last year the european union won the nobel peace prize for its role.
Non-Argumentative	 the prize committee justified its decision on the basis that “the union and its forerunners have for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in europe.”
Non-Argumentative	it gave three interlocking reasons:1, today war between germany and france is unthinkable.
Non-Argumentative	 this shows how, through well-aimed efforts and by building up mutual confidence, historical enemies can become close partners.2, the division between east and west has to a large extent been brought to an end; democracy has been strengthened; many ethnically-based national conflicts have been settled.3, the possibility of eu membership… advanced democracy and human rightsbut today the integration of the european union through the single currency, the euro, can be seen as being as much a threat to peace as it is a creator of it.
Non-Argumentative	this in part depends on what we consider to mean by peace, even now there are very few who would argue that the euro will lead to another war in europe (though there are a few such as dominic sandbrook who think it possible or likely), but a threat to peace does not just have to mean traditional inter-state conflict, with europe's ever declining defence budgets and pacifistic people this option seems vanishingly small.
Non-Argumentative	 instead the conflict for the moment is economic and political.
Non-Argumentative	 for the purposes of this debate then we will consider large scale internal conflict to be conflict rather than just interstate war.
Argumentative	 the euro takes away the national sovereign right to have one 's own currency .
Argumentative	 as the currency has an immense impact on the economic sovereignty , the state 's ability to influence its own economy , of a nation it is curtailing the sovereignty of that state and its parliament .
Argumentative	 in particular it prevents any depreciation to regain competitiveness so forcing countries to opt for austerity as the only way to make themselves competitive .
Argumentative	 they are finding that economic decisions are no longer taken in their own capitals but now the decision making is forced on them from berlin .
Argumentative	 the people have regularly demonstrated that they do not want more integration in europe yet this is exactly what the euro provides .
Argumentative	 just take for example the no votes against the lisbon treaty in france and the netherlands , countries traditionally near the core of the european project showing the dislike for further integration .
Argumentative	 most countries did not have referendums on joining the euro , a decision that they are now finding has immense consequences on individual 's lives .
Argumentative	 this is then leading to extremism in many countries where the populace feels they no longer have control over their economic future .
Argumentative	 even germany now has an anti-euro party , alternative für deutschland , and support for eurosceptic parties throughout europe has been rising ever since the start of the crisis in the eurozone .
Argumentative	 most of these will be peaceful but there are already parties like golden dawn in greece that use violence and intimidation in politics .
Argumentative	 the euro crisis has forced the eurozone members into making policy on the fly without the support of the electorate .
Argumentative	 for example national politicians , who are of course democratically elected , have been making a series of promises against bailouts that they have then broken ; a promise by german chancellor angela merkel that `` an extension of the current bailout funds will not happen on germany 's watch , '' lasted all of two months .
Argumentative	 the voters of the countries that are providing the bailouts have not voted for the packages that are using their money and they were certainly not in the manifestos of the governing parties .
Argumentative	 parliaments have voted on the measures but have often been given little choice and little time to debate complicated measures .
Argumentative	 on the other hand in those who are being bailed out the conditions that are being attached are unpopular , in particular the demand for austerity has caused riots .
Argumentative	 the parliaments of the recipient states have generally voted in favour so opposition has come from the streets .
Argumentative	 cyprus is the first country to reject a bailout as a result of its attendant conditions ; although when faced with no other option the politicians buckled it could be simply the first country to try to escape the straight jacket .
Argumentative	 when the option is take conditions the public wo n't accept , such as savers having their money taken as in the cyprus bail out , or exit from the euro then the relationships within the euro are going to be increasingly conflictual .
Argumentative	 in the 1990s the european union introduced the principle of subsidiarity in order to try to placate fears about too much power moving to ` brussels ' from national parliaments .
Argumentative	 subsidiarity means that power will reside at the appropriate level that is closest to the citizens , be that regional , national , or european .
Argumentative	 it is questionable whether this principle has stopped the european level from accumulating power , even the tenth amendment in the us that reserves power to the states when not explicitly given the federal level has not stopped the moment of power to washington .
Argumentative	 subsidiarity has however boosted the power of the regions and provided a cover for separatism .
Argumentative	 the existence of the euro provides a kind of safety net for nations that desire independence from the current unions they are in , particularly catalonia and scotland .
Argumentative	 the leaders of pro-independence parties can claim that they will be no worse off for leaving their current union as they will still be a part of the euro and the european union .
Argumentative	 artur mas , catalonia 's president , has even suggested that its referendum question would be `` do you want catalonia to become a new state within the european union ? ''
Argumentative	 there have been hints regional independence movements could lead to violence pujol the general secretary of the governing catalan party says `` there will be no way to avoid it .
Argumentative	 if we do n't deliver it someone else will .
Argumentative	 more radical parties .
Argumentative	 but in a negotiation ... it 's not the best thing to reveal what you are going to do next '' .
Argumentative	 the result then may be a more violent campaign as happened in the basque country .
Argumentative	 many have argued that the euro inevitably leads to a transfer union , where there are large transfers of money between the members , far larger than the tiny eu budget , but so far the germans have been implacably opposed .
Argumentative	 there has been opposition to bailouts precisely because it is seen as the start of a union transferring money from the core countries , such as germany , to the poorer periphery .
Argumentative	 inability to help those areas that are less competitive is the main problem of a currency union without accompanying fiscal union .
Argumentative	 the euro has therefore built in the competitive advantage of germany ; it exports huge amounts to the euro 's periphery because these countries can not devalue their currency to make their products competitive .
Argumentative	 it is therefore inevitable that these countries will go into debt paying for these goods .
Argumentative	 the is then a cycle of conflict between competitive countries and those who are not competitive in which as we have seen those who are uncompetitive are seen as lazy while the competitive as bullying .
Argumentative	 this tension will eventually either lead to a split or conflict .
