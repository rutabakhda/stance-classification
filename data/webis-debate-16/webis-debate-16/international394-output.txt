Non-Argumentative	for decades, the israeli-palestinian conflict has revolved around one particularly pointed question and debate: should the palestinian people be given their own state, or is a two-state solution to the conflict the best idea among the various alternatives?
Non-Argumentative	 barack obama explicitly supports a two-state solution, saying that "a two-state solution is the only solution".
Non-Argumentative	 while many in israel and elsewhere oppose the idea, the two-state solution is considered the consensus solution under discussion by the key parties to the conflict, most recently at the annapolis conference in november 2007.
Argumentative	 while alternatives exist (such as a one-state solution or forms of autonomy under the status quo) palestinian, israeli, and global leaders are primarily engaged in the debate surrounding a two-state solution.
Argumentative	palestinians and israelis will not be able to live together in peace in the same state any time in the foreseeable future .
Argumentative	 the idea that palestinians and israelis can live in peace and harmony in one state , with tolerance for each other and in keeping with democratic principles of inclusion , is simply naive .
Argumentative	 this idea has been made impossible by nearly a century of direct conflict between these people .
Argumentative	 while this might change in coming centuries , it is unacceptable to adopt a one-state policy now based on these naive ideas .
Argumentative	 israeli president shimon peres has argued : `` establishing a single multinational country is a tenuous path that does not bode well for peace but , rather , enforces the conflict 's perpetuation .
Argumentative	 lebanon , ravaged by bloodshed and instability , represents only one of many examples of an undesirable quagmire of this nature . ''
Argumentative	  this stance has been endorsed by leaders and officials from around the world : us special envoy george mitchell has stated `` in the case of the israeli-palestinian conflict , we believe that the two-state solution , two states living side by side in peace , is the best and the only way to resolve this conflict . ''
Argumentative	  pope benedict xvi has similarly called on israel 's leadership to embrace the two-state solution for peace with the palestinians : `` i plead with all those responsible to explore every possible avenue in the search for a just resolution of the outstanding difficulties , so that both peoples may live in peace in a homeland of their own , within secure and internationally recognized borders . ''
Argumentative	  even colonel gaddafi , the late libyan leader , argued that a two-state solution was essential for peace .
Argumentative	  the reason the two-state solution has been recognised as the best for peace is because it respects the democratic will of both peoples for a state of their own .
Argumentative	 as peres argues , `` the jewish people want and deserve to live in peace in their rightful , historical homeland .
Argumentative	 the palestinian people want and deserve their own land , their own political institutions and their right to self-determination .
Argumentative	 it is vital that this cause be based on the prospect of coexistence between jews and arabs , which translates into cooperation in fields such as the economy , tourism , the environment and defence .
Argumentative	 achieving all this will be possible only by granting each people its own state and borders , to enable their citizens to pray according to their faiths , cultivate their cultures , speak their own languages and safeguard their heritages . ''
Argumentative	  because only a two-state solution allows for this peaceful co-existence and development , a two-state solution is best for peace and thus more justified than a one-state solution .
Argumentative	 as described in the above quote by peres , the vast majority of israelis desire to live in a jewish homeland in which they can define their own institutions and culture in light of their jewish heritage .
Argumentative	 a one-state solution , however , would undermine israel 's legitimacy and internationally recognized right to exist as a sovereign jewish state in the land of the jewish forefathers .
Argumentative	 from israel 's perspective , it is not possible for the jewish people to accept an arrangement that signifies the end of the existence of a jewish state , which would be the result of a one-state solution , as the state could not be considered a jewish one if it housed a very large palestinian population , possibly even a palestinian majority .
Argumentative	  for this reason it is unlikely that any one-state solution would be truly democratic , and rather would be a situation of an israeli minority ruling over a palestinian majority , who would be largely excluded from the running of the country and determining their own affairs .
Argumentative	  a one-state solution would only produce an explosive situation in which jews would dominate the economy and most other aspects of the new state , creating a reality of exploitation .
Argumentative	 at that point in time , the new state would be a new form of occupation that would only set the conflict on a more violent track .
Argumentative	  therefore , the new state created by a one-state solution would be unacceptable either to israelis or to palestinians , as it would cease to be either jewish or democratic , and so would not be a just outcome .
Argumentative	 only a two-state solution can keep israel jewish and democratic , and allow a palestinian state similarly to be arab and democratic , as it would most likely wish .
Argumentative	 a two-state solution can offer sufficient territory for both israelis and palestinians .
Argumentative	 for israel this would mean keeping the vast majority of areas inhabited by israeli citizens within the state of israel .
Argumentative	 the two-state solution would also , however , offer sufficient land to the palestinians .
Argumentative	 while cynics might question the size of the west bank and gaza , optimists should look no further than singapore for reassurance .
Argumentative	 the area of the west bank and gaza is nine times as large as singapore 's , yet the combined population of palestinians in both regions is smaller than that of singapore .
Argumentative	 singapore enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world .
Argumentative	 the palestinians are capable of achieving similar success , through instituting a modern economy based on science , technology and the benefits of peace .
Argumentative	  moreover , throughout the years polls have consistently showed respectable israeli and palestinian majorities in favour of a negotiated two-state settlement .
Argumentative	  even the iranian president mahmud ahmadinezhad has stated that iran would support a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
Argumentative	 the success of a two-state solution , therefore , would , at a minimum , gain the support and possibly cooperation of the iranians .
Argumentative	 this would be valuable diplomatically , particularly in resolving the larger conflict between iran and the west .
Argumentative	  therefore , the best way to satisfy both sides and achieve peace is to adopt a two-state solution , which is therefore the most just solution .
