Non-Argumentative	in 1930, there were between five and ten million wild african elephants; by 1990, when they were added to the list of critically endangered species, only about 600,000 remained1.
Non-Argumentative	 as part of the effort to combat this threat, in 1986, ivory trading was banned by the united nations convention on international trade in endangered species (cites).
Non-Argumentative	 by the mid-1990s, the population of african elephants was rising by an average of 4.5% a year, however bythe trend had again been reversed and the population stood at around 500,000.
Non-Argumentative	 asian elephants have fared just as badly, there numbers have dropped from 200,000 a century ago to around 40,000 today1.
Non-Argumentative	during the '90s, when elephant populations were increasing, cites allowed botswana, zimbabwe and namibia to sell ivory stockpiled by their governments' environmental agencies to japan, the centre of international demand for ivory, as a one-off measure.
Non-Argumentative	 insouth africa and other southern african states argued unsuccessfully at the cites convention in nairobi for the ban on ivory sales to be more generally relaxed.
Argumentative	 in 2008, cite temporarily lifted the ban on the sale of existing stockpiles of ivory, generating much-needed income for african states2.
Argumentative	poaching has been effectively eliminated in parts of southern africa through efficient game park management and the development of game tourism , which gives local peoples an incentive to protect wildlife as a long-term economic resource .
Argumentative	 in kenya , tourism is the third largest contributor to their economy , and% of this is derived from wildlife , but it is still not enough1 .
Argumentative	 the director of the association in kenya charged with elephant protection , the lusaka agreement taskforce , has admitted mobilizing adequate resources to combat the illegal wildlife trade is a challenge2 .
Argumentative	 for this approach to be sustained the parks must generate greater income ; realistically , this can only be done through the sale of stockpiled ivory .
Argumentative	 why should they not be able to profit from stockpiled ivory confiscated from poachers or dead elephants ?
Argumentative	 ivory is expensive to store , and degrades over time .
Argumentative	 it costs zimbabwe $million annually to secure its stockpile1 .
Argumentative	 the wildlife authority in the country is now keen for the moratorium on the international sale of ivory to end inso that they can benefit from the stockpiling and recoup the costs of storage1 .
Argumentative	 zimbabwe is also believed to be close to the limit of its storage space1 .
Argumentative	 it is therefore sensible to allow its sale in order to recoup these expenses and to do so on a permanent , controlled basis , rather than through one-off schemes such as thesale to japan .
Argumentative	 the elephant populations of southern african states are growing rapidly , placing a strain upon the resources of the national parks in which they live .
Argumentative	 this has necessitated culls with the result that government environment agencies have built up large stockpiles of ivory , also acquired from animals that died naturally , which they are currently unable to sell .
Argumentative	 relaxing the cites ban on trading ivory , subject to careful regulation , would bring much needed cash to the environmental programmes of these impoverished countries , helping them to safeguard the long-term survival of african elephants .
Argumentative	 the relaxation of the cites ban in the late '90s was worth $million for bostwana , namibia and zimbabwe ; as regular income , such a figure would be invaluable for a struggling central african economy .
Argumentative	 states that possess elephant populations that are currently growing would be eligible , under the new model , to sell their stockpiled ivory .
Argumentative	 there would be no limit on the amount of ivory sold , provided that the growth rate of the population remained positive .
Argumentative	 therefore , the confiscated ivory from poachers and small-scale culls would be eligible to be sold on the international market .
Argumentative	 all sales would have to go through the environmental agencies of the states ' concerned .
Argumentative	 a trading ban does not choke off demand for the ivory , but instead raises the price to exorbitant levels , encouraging poaching .
Argumentative	 demand sincehas been depressed by japan 's economic problems , from which it is now emerging , while in china ivory is associated with prosperity and is a status symbol ; as the number of wealthy chinese increases , so too is the demand and price of ivory .
Argumentative	 poachers are only going to be further encouraged to disregard the trading ban , whatever the costs1 .
Argumentative	 legitimate , regulated sales would undercut the illegal market and drive the poachers out of business , ensuring elephant populations are protected and remain stable .
