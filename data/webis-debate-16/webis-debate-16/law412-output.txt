Non-Argumentative	“we build prisons to hold people we are afraid of, but fill them with people we are angry at.”
Non-Argumentative	the penalties handed out by the judiciary to convicted criminals are said to serve four objectives – to deter, to rehabilitate, to protect and to punish.
Non-Argumentative	 criminal sentencing should deter those contemplating criminal behaviour from carrying out criminal acts; the consequences of being convicted of a criminal act should outweigh any potential gain that act may deliver.
Non-Argumentative	 a sentence should also serve to address the causes of an individual’s criminal behaviour, and to provide him/her with the training, medical or psychological treatment and understanding of social norms that will ensure he does not resort to criminal activity again.
Non-Argumentative	 at the very least, a sentence should protect the public by actively preventing a criminal from committing further offences.
Non-Argumentative	the penalties for criminal behaviour available to judges and magistrates in liberal democracies include imprisonment, fines, restorative sentences such as community service, mandatory psychological treatment or addiction treatment and restrictions on freedom of movement and association (including curfews and “gang injunctions”).
Non-Argumentative	evidence indicates that despite the diversity of sentencing options available, the judiciary relies heavily on imprisonment as a response to criminal activity.
Non-Argumentative	 this is partly a result of political discourse that plays on the assumption that the threat of imprisonment can deter crime.
Non-Argumentative	 politicians who want to give the appearance of tackling crime and social disorder effectively typically increase the length of custodial sentences for certain crimes, and reduce judges’ discretion to award non-custodial sentences.
Non-Argumentative	it is typical for prisons to be viewed by judiciaries as an adequate punishment and vehicle for rehabilitating violent criminals, who have committed offences such as murder, rape, assault or aggravated muggings.
Non-Argumentative	 it is not certain that prison is the best environment in which to confront non-violent offenders, such as drug addicts, fraudsters and thieves.
Non-Argumentative	 rehabilitation, many argue, is more effective in lowering the risk of re-offending if handled in the community.
Argumentative	 it is argued that imprisoning individuals found to be guilty of non-violent crimes is a disproportionate response to their actions and does not serve the objectives of criminal sentencing set out above .
Argumentative	 criminal sentences must deliver a punishment in proportion to the crime an offender has committed .
Argumentative	 a disproportionate sentence - using the death penalty to punish theft , for instance - is less likely to be perceived as a fair or rational response to criminal behaviour .
Argumentative	 an offender who is punished excessively is more likely to see himself as the victim of injustice , and less likely to consider the impact of his own conduct .
Argumentative	 a law abiding individual who that fears that jaywalking may result in jail time will have no confidence in the criminal justice system , and may begin seeking other sources of security .
Argumentative	 there are many alternatives to penal sentences available to magistrates and judges .
Argumentative	 using fines and curfews to restrict financial and personal liberty , alongside restorative forms of punishment such as community service , can provide a much more efficient way of condemning an individual 's criminal behaviour .
Argumentative	 prison brings together individuals with a wide range of social and behavioural problems that incline them towards deviance and violence .
Argumentative	 these individuals are placed in closed conditions with restricted access to productive activities .
Argumentative	 in many western nations , a lack of funding and staff means that most prisoners have little to fill their time , and may be confined to their cells for up to twenty three hours a day .
Argumentative	 the privations of prison make prisoners more , rather than less likely to engage in violent or exploitative behaviour .
Argumentative	 prisoners in overcrowded , understaffed jails are more likely to develop mental illnesses and less likely to have such conditions diagnosed and treated .
Argumentative	 the brutality of their surroundings makes prisoners more likely to seek the protection and comradeship offered by gangs or the comfort of intoxicants .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the shame and isolation associated with incarceration cause prisoner 's non-criminal social networks to decay .
Argumentative	 relationships with partners or spouses may break down .
Argumentative	 contact with children may be limited .
Argumentative	 families may shun the offender , leaving him with a social circle comprised mainly of fellow inmates .
Argumentative	 these associations can prove toxic , leading offenders to validate each other 's behaviour and share knowledge about criminal activities .
Argumentative	 finally , the stigma of criminality extends to employment .
Argumentative	 businesses may be unwilling to employ those with criminal records , limiting ex-offenders ' opportunities for social reintegration .
Argumentative	 prisons should be used only where the imperative to protect society from criminal behaviour can not be met by the imperative to rehabilitate .
Argumentative	 a minority of offenders will be incorrigibly violent and uncontrollable , but under the status quo , these dangerous offenders not represent the majority of the prison population , see statistics above .
Argumentative	 firstly , it should be noted that among many inmates , especially young men , criminal actions , including public order offences , assault and petty theft , are carried out on impulse .
Argumentative	 impulsive behaviour is often influenced by alcohol and peer pressure .
Argumentative	 under these circumstances , deterrence is ineffective .
Argumentative	 in the light of these findings , deterrence can be seen as a matter of policing and detection , rather than a set of misleading assumptions based on an over-simplification of rational-actor theory .
