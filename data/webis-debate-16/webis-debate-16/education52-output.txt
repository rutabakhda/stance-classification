Non-Argumentative	all countries have mathematics as a key part of the curriculum for young children.
Non-Argumentative	 most education systems teach maths for quite a bit longer than that.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk, mathematics is compulsory up to gcse level (age 16) while in the usa it is often taught to the end of high school.
Non-Argumentative	however, maths is a subject which people often complain about.
Non-Argumentative	 it shows up in almost every collection of “most hated subjects.”
Non-Argumentative	 and also in more professional polling where 37% of adults admit to having hated maths at school.
Non-Argumentative	 many criticisms are levelled at it, including being boring and not being useful.
Non-Argumentative	basic arithmetic is an essential life skill, which we use literally every day – prices, times etc. any reasonable education system should include this.
Non-Argumentative	 but it is not far-fetched to say that most children will have learnt this by about 15.
Non-Argumentative	 that being the case, imagine a proposal to stop all compulsory mathematics lessons after that age.
Non-Argumentative	 is this a good idea?
Argumentative	 maths is one of the least engaging subjects taught at school .
Argumentative	 subjects like chemistry are full of flashes , fires and experiments which help people see what they 're being taught in front of them .
Argumentative	 history starts with telling stories , and even though that 's not what the subject is really about , it offers a window into it .
Argumentative	 by contrast , maths has almost nothing similar .
Argumentative	 asking children to use trigonometry to find the height of a tree does not fool them -- all they see is another triangle .
Argumentative	 some people enjoy it , but many do not .
Argumentative	 forcing people through maths classes which they find boring and irrelevant will only put them off maths ; a recent study found that motivation was the most important factor for improving maths grades .
Argumentative	 this in turn makes their children less likely to study maths , and causes a cycle in which a large section of the population have as little to do with maths as they can .
Argumentative	 it would be much better to not make these people study maths .
Argumentative	 true , they would end up not knowing any more than the bare essentials , but this is better than making them hate it .
Argumentative	 it is a fundamental principle of education that different people think in different ways .
Argumentative	 one notable application of this is the theory of different learning styles , and it also makes people have a preference for certain subjects .
Argumentative	 many people find maths hard ,% of teens think it is the most difficult subject , for a variety of reasons -- it simply is n't suited to all minds .
Argumentative	 another fundamental principle is that all children are equal , in the sense that we should support them equally in helping them find the right opportunities .
Argumentative	 it follows that we should teach them something useful and relevant to their personality and preferences .
Argumentative	 but whatever that may turn out to be , it will not be maths , and maths would just waste their time .
Argumentative	 it makes sense to teach arithmetic to even these people , but there is no need to make them study further .
Argumentative	 schools are constantly pressed for time , money and staff .
Argumentative	 it is simply not possible to teach everything to everyone .
Argumentative	 this means that all of education is a balancing act .
Argumentative	 we try and isolate the most important parts of a subject and teach children what they need to know , but first , we have to isolate which subjects are important .
Argumentative	 so , for example , we teach history rather than philosophy and physics rather than astronomy .
Argumentative	 everything we teach therefore comes at the expense of not teaching something else and there are already some countries that choose other priorities ; france for example prioritises philosophy .
Argumentative	 taking time away from maths has two advantages .
Argumentative	 firstly , means we can teach other subjects instead , which will be more useful , such as dedicated classes on writing , or debating .
Argumentative	 secondly , we can spend longer on those subjects which we already teach , making them better .
Argumentative	 as a bonus , we could even use this time to extend science lessons to include whatever maths is necessary , meaning we do n't lose out at all .
