Non-Argumentative	the events of september 11thresulted in governments all over the world taking extraordinary measures to enhance the security of their citizens.
Non-Argumentative	 whether this was justified or not is yet another flashpoint in the age old battle of liberty versus security.
Non-Argumentative	in the us, new security measures included unparalleled airport checkpoint procedures, face recognition devices in public places, tracking, monitoring and identification through thumb printing of certain categories of visitors, random searches of internet content by intelligence officers, the ability to demand records on somebody from any business or organisation, the use of wiretaps and the ability to intercept and read email, and eavesdropping on conversations between a lawyer and their client.
Non-Argumentative	 the possible use of racial profiling to target “suspicious individuals” for more thorough searches and questioning is also being seriously discussed, although allegedly not in operation.
Non-Argumentative	 most of these measures are associated with loss of privacy; liberty has also been directly infringed through the detention without charge or trial of non-citizens, on the grounds they do not enjoy the same rights as citizens, the designation of us citizens as enemy combatants and their indefinite detention, and by trying suspects through military tribunals rather than in a normal court with judge and jury.
Non-Argumentative	on the one hand, extraordinary security measures are required to counteract the imminent threats of terrorism that has become much more cunning and resourceful over the last decade.
Non-Argumentative	 on the other hand, the introduction of these measures comes at the expense of sacrificing some of our most cherished civil liberties and rights as citizens.
Argumentative	 no doubt, there is a trade-off between security and liberty, but what is the ideal balance between them?
Argumentative	terrorism is part of the modern world and is inextricably linked with the rise of modern communications , the internet , and a global community .
Argumentative	 this is an age in which space and time are bending to the tune of new media -- information at your fingertips may sound nice , but for those who want to destroy , it only makes their object easier to attain .
Argumentative	 and so more strict national security measures must be employed in order to keep up with the enemy .
Argumentative	 escalation is the name of the game imposed on governments around the world by terrorists for example the mumbai terrorists used gps systems to guide them into mumbai , attacks were coordinated on cell and satellite phones and blackberrys were used to monitor the international reaction .
Argumentative	 in order to keep up states need new powers to stop , deter , and prevent terrorism .
Argumentative	 the government needs to secure state-security first ; only then can the debate on civil liberties begin , and only then .
Argumentative	 negative cases of security abuse are few and have been greatly exaggerated by an emphatic civil rights lobby that has no empathy for the victims of terrorism .
Argumentative	 of course , with any wide-scale attempt to fight terrorism there are bound to be a few cases of abuse of security measures .
Argumentative	 for example in the uk terrorism suspects were originally detained without charge under the anti-terrorism , crime and security act however the detention was declared unlawful by the law lords inso the government introduced new scaled back policies such as ` control orders ' .
Argumentative	 therefore government has always been willing to scale back its security legislation when the courts believe it goes too far .
Argumentative	 nonetheless it is not a good idea to shut down all security measures under a pretext that they violate rights .
Argumentative	 the majority of the measures are intended to safeguard those civil liberties instead of abusing them .
Argumentative	 the usa is at present far better than most countries in their respect and regard for civil liberties .
Argumentative	 new security measures do not greatly compromise this liberty , and the us measures are at the very least comparable with similar measures already in effect in other democratic developed countries , e.g. spain and the uk , which have had to cope with domestic terrorism for far longer than the usa .
Argumentative	 the facts speak for themselves -- the usa enjoys a healthy western-liberalism the likes of which most of the world 's people can not even conceive of .
Argumentative	 the issue of the erosion of a few minor liberties of , states like the us 's , citizens should be overlooked in favour of the much greater issue of protecting the very existence of that state .
Argumentative	 let us not forget that is with the consent of the public that these security measures are taken , cctv for example was a populist measure that has often been considered a threat to civil liberties .
Argumentative	 it is in line with democratic ideals ; the majority of the country wants greater security .
Argumentative	 for example in59 % of americans wanted the patriot act extended .
Argumentative	 and because democracy embodies all those values we are fighting for -- freedom and equality included - we must adhere to a democratic spirit when deciding on how to organise ourselves or else risk falling into the same mind-set as those terrorists themselves .
Argumentative	 it would be incredibly disingenuous of the opposition if they did not concede that the dangers are great and that something must be done .
Argumentative	 because , deep down , everyone knows that it is simply a balancing of risks -- in practice all the government is trying to do is save lives .
Argumentative	 it is of course , the government 's primary duty to protect citizens but this can only be done with the loss of some civil liberties .
Argumentative	 these liberties will of course still be completely protected by the courts .
Argumentative	 when it comes to the issue of life and death , it is the proposition 's hope that a few civil liberties would be only willingly given up by any prudent citizen .
