Non-Argumentative	perhaps ironically, one of the effects of climate change has been to open up new areas of the polar caps – previously unreachable –for use by human beings, including for mineral extraction.
Non-Argumentative	 the political situation in the arctic ocean gives added bite to the situation, with several countries making claims to the arctic ocean and so its sea bed with attendant mineral wealth.
Non-Argumentative	  the relationship between preservation and development is always a difficult one.
Non-Argumentative	 there are various balances in play – between modern jobs and cultural heritage, between energy needs and environmental protection, between the possible needs of future generations and the all too pressing interests of the current one.
Non-Argumentative	the primary resources available through arctic exploration are oil, gas, minerals, fresh water (1/5 of the world’s water supply) and fish.
Non-Argumentative	 but there is also interest in opening up new shipping routes through the region which would reduce travel times from east asia to europe and north america’s atlantic seaboard.
Non-Argumentative	 the region also has enormous biodiversity, especially in terms of genotypes that are unique to the habitat.
Non-Argumentative	the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that the total volume of sea ice has reduced in the lastyears.
Non-Argumentative	 however, commentators of varying degrees of credibility have put forward a wide range of explanations for the change.
Non-Argumentative	 it is important not to conflate two different debates when discussing this topic.
Non-Argumentative	 at one level – the interest of this debate – there is the issue of how to manage the arctic itself.
Non-Argumentative	 the issue of the wider implications of climate change, including the impact of arctic warming on salinity and temperature in the world’s oceans, whilst interesting, are a separate issue.
Non-Argumentative	although there are various definitions of what constitutes the arctic – many of them including sub-arctic, sparsely populated forest and tundra – for the purposes of this debate it is that area north of the arctic circle (66° 33'n).
Non-Argumentative	 the total size of this area is 40,000,000 km2 (15,000,000 sq mi) and covers 8% of the earth.
Non-Argumentative	by ‘exploitation’ this motion will be considered to primarily refer to exploration and drilling for mineral resources.
Non-Argumentative	 a secondary issue is the shipping opportunities and the transportation of these resources, it’s worth noting that increased opportunities for tourism has also caused some concern but the main focus of the global discussion on this issue as related to the exploitation of resources.
Non-Argumentative	 primarily the focus is on oil and gas rather than the considerably smaller reserves of other resources.
Non-Argumentative	 the issue of the ownership of fishing rights is also important but will not be touched on here as it has received far less coverage and comment in the current climate.
Non-Argumentative	the various attempts that have been made so far to extend the claims of arctic nations to greater parts of the sea bed and ocean, as well as efforts to rapidly increase drilling within domestic territory, has led many – environmentalists and others – to suggest that a treaty is needed to protect the whole of the arctic.
Non-Argumentative	 this could be modelled on the antarctic treaty which freezes territorial claims and bans any military activity in the region; this would not affect current territory but would prevent any militarisation of the arctic ocean.
Non-Argumentative	 it would add to this an equivalent of the convention on the regulation of antarctic mineral resource activities which does not entirely ban extraction but prevents such activity until it is judged that there would be no adverse environmental impact.
Argumentative	 as we are using the resources of so much of the planet we should think about our legacy to future generations and leave the resources of the arctic to future generations .
Argumentative	 there are several reasons why we should do so .
Argumentative	 first of all drilling in the arctic means drilling in some of the harshest conditions on earth ; with many of the projects being set up it means drilling in deep areas of the ocean that were inaccessible only a couple of decades ago .
Argumentative	 it also means drilling in freezing conditions while being potentially vulnerable to icebergs .
Argumentative	 disasters like the deepwater horizon in the gulf of mexico have shown that oil companies are not prepared for oil disasters in deep water and repair would be more difficult a long way from civilization .
Argumentative	 while the technology for this does not yet exist in future it probably will .
Argumentative	 it makes sense that we should leave such hard to reach resources until it is possible to extract it easily and safely .
Argumentative	 in the mean time we should be focusing our efforts on easier to reach resources and on developing alternatives .
Argumentative	 such a policy will be beneficial to future generations both through making a greener economy and by leaving an emergency reserve of fossil fuel that can be used if necessary .
Argumentative	 mineral extraction is not a clean process and the arctic is acknowledged as a fragile ecosystem .
Argumentative	 in addition to the pollution that using these fuels will cause elsewhere in the world , the process of extraction itself is fraught with risks .
Argumentative	 there is some destruction caused simply by the process of building and running rigs with everything running normally , but the nightmare scenario is a major spill .
Argumentative	 let 's be clear , with the best will in the world , there will be a spill ; difficult and unpredictable conditions , gruelling tests for both the machinery and the engineers that manage it , and a track record that leaves a lot to be desired in far more habitable and accessible environments .
Argumentative	 there are two difficulties posed in terms of an off-shore , or below-ice in this case , spill .
Argumentative	 the first problem is that stopping the spill would be vastly more complicated logistically than anything previously attempted , making previous deep-sea containment exercises seem simple by comparison .
Argumentative	 the exxon valdez disaster showed the large scale damage that oil spills near the poles can have large and long lasting effects on the ecosystem ; hundreds of thousands of seabirds were killed in the spill and it is estimates some habitats will takeyears to recover .
Argumentative	 any such disaster is made much worse above the arctic circle because of the cold .
Argumentative	 oil degrades faster in warmer waters because the metabolism of microbes that break the oil down works much more slowly in the cold arctic waters , at the same time the oil spreads out less so provides less surface area .
Argumentative	 init was reported that more than two decades after the spill there were still 23,000 gallons of relatively un-weathered oil in prince william sound .
Argumentative	 the second issue , as demonstrated by large scale experimentation in the 1970s is that the oil would interact with the polar ice to affect a far larger area than would normally be the case .
Argumentative	 at the very least , it seems sensible to have a moratorium on sub-glacial drilling until the technology is available to deal safely and securely with a spill .
Argumentative	 the opening up of the arctic ocean through climate change also opens up territorial claims as where there are resources at stake states are keen to make a claim so as to exploit them .
Argumentative	 for example inrussia 's then president medvedev stated `` our first and fundamental task is to turn the arctic into a resource base for russia in the 21st century . ''
Argumentative	 such competition for resources can lead to conflict as is increasingly being shown in the east and south china seas .
Argumentative	 the antarctic treaty however freezes these territorial claims , as would our proposed treaty .
Argumentative	 it also bans military activity so preventing any completion from getting out of hand .
Argumentative	 the proposal would also ban the exploitation of the arctic 's resources so reducing the cause of any conflict .
