Non-Argumentative	 there arecountries that have ratified the rome statute including all of the european union member states, brazil, canada and japan.
Non-Argumentative	the united states has attempted to “un-sign” the rome statute by declaring it has no intention to ratify the rome statute – something that would require a vote of the us senate, which has been highly hostile to ratification.
Non-Argumentative	 subsequent us legislation, including the american service-members’ protection act, dubbed the “hague invasion act” by its critics, authorizes the us president to use “all means necessary and appropriate” to remove any americans from the icc – in theory, according to critics of the legislation, even up to invading the hague.
