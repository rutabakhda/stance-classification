Non-Argumentative	this can take place in a number of different spheres.
Non-Argumentative	 at present, former leaders of the khmer rouge are being tried in cambodia, the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia continues to seek justice, and a small number of world war two nazi trials continue to be conducted.
Non-Argumentative	 since the establishment of the international criminal court in 2002, it has been primarily responsible for prosecutions of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Non-Argumentative	 this question will also be relevant to the punishment of north african and middle eastern dictators, currently under threat by the arab spring.
Argumentative	Â the intention of many crimes of war is to destroy and demoralise individuals and communities .
Argumentative	 as a result , they often cause on-going harm to victims who can not feel safe in their communities even after the conflict has ended .
Argumentative	 for victims , prosecuting war criminals has a vital cathartic function in helping them , to some extent , to come to terms with the crimes committed against them and their families .
Argumentative	 while full compensation is impossible , both the symbolic realisation of justice and the illustration of real commitment to prevention allows people to rebuild their lives to some extent .
Argumentative	 failure to prosecute sends victims a message that the attacks on their freedoms were somehow acceptable .
Argumentative	 for post-conflict societies to function , the tensions and divisions of the conflict must be brought out into the open and dealt with in order to be fully put to rest .
Argumentative	 those most responsible for war crimes must be brought to justice , those involved in the regime but less culpable must have opportunity to make amends and victims must feel that they have been compensated .
Argumentative	 this allows compromise and the potential for effective governance .
Argumentative	 the alternative is to allow undiscussed , simmering hatreds and resentments to persist , which undermine growth and create a risk of further conflict .
