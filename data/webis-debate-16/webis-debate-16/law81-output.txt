Non-Argumentative	repressive governments, here defined as governments that are anti-democratic, that do not afford general civil rights to their citizens, and that do not have a robust respect for the rule of law, have sought to quell dissent and the voices of reform by many means.
Non-Argumentative	 through a sophisticated security apparatus, states have succeeded in making most forms of physical protest extremely difficult.
Non-Argumentative	 demonstrations and clandestine organization are suppressed with the same vigour and effectiveness.
Non-Argumentative	 countries like china, north korea, cuba, and iran have all developed these strategies with precision.
Non-Argumentative	one of the only avenues people in these countries feel capable of turning to is in the blogosphere.
Non-Argumentative	 bloggers are at the forefront of the battle for political rights in china and cuba.
Non-Argumentative	 but their zeal often leads them to fall foul of the government, and many end up harassed by state agents, or even in prison.
Non-Argumentative	 in vietnam bloggers have been reporting on crackdowns on house churches and other human rights abuses.
Non-Argumentative	 the response is surveillance and ‘working sessions’ with police interrogators.
Non-Argumentative	 bloggers such as nguyen van hai, ta phong tan, and phanh thanh hai were jailed for ‘anti-state propaganda’ and nguyen hoang vi beaten and stripped by police officers.
Non-Argumentative	 in all such cases no matter what country the government seeks to undermine the writers by accusing them of wicked plots, treason, and manipulation by outside power.
Non-Argumentative	the appropriate response to all this that this house, defined broadly as democratic states and narrowly as the western liberal democracies, should adopt in response to all this is contentious.
Non-Argumentative	 this focuses on the decision to offer amnesty to those facing prosecution in their native countries.
Non-Argumentative	 this policy has been implemented to various degrees already in some countries, with the united states, for example, housing dissidents from china, cuba, and elsewhere.
Non-Argumentative	 but whether this is good policy, whether it should be expanded or ended, remains to be seen.
Argumentative	 the internet has become the paramount means of voicing dissent within repressive regimes .
Argumentative	 as the technology regimes have to keep control of their people increases , with access to high-tech surveillance technology adding to their already formidable arsenals of physical oppression , the internet has become the only platform to express meaningful dissent .
Argumentative	 the jasmine revolution in tunisia , for example , wherein people mobilized to overthrow their dictator has even been dubbed the twitter revolution .
Argumentative	 bloggers have become a major voice of dissent in other repressive regimes , including cuba and china .
Argumentative	 yet the blog platform is far from safe .
Argumentative	 governments have sought to crack down on bloggers ' ability to dissent , using draconian methods like imprisonment to cow them into silence .
Argumentative	 in china the arrests of bloggers like zhai xiaobing , who was arrested and detained for simply posting a joke about communist party , have served to frighten many into silence .
Argumentative	 so long as information is denied to the public , governments are able to maintain their repression .
Argumentative	 only external help from democratic , or at least more liberal , states can provide the safe haven for people who have rubbed their governments the wrong way in their pursuit of reform and justice .
Argumentative	 the universality of human rights , of the freedom of speech and of due process is all touted as crucial by the world 's democracies .
Argumentative	 democratic countries are frequently vocal on the subject of liberty , on the superiority of their system of government that provides for the best protection of human dignity .
Argumentative	 by offering amnesty to bloggers , the people standing at the forefront of the democratic cause in oppressive regimes , western countries take a largely low-cost action that provides for the security and safety of some the bravest people in the public arena .
Argumentative	 the west must stop kowtowing to oppression and make a stand to offer an umbrella of protection to those who need it .
Argumentative	 that protection is absolutely crucial to the development of more dissent in the blogosphere and on the ground .
Argumentative	 only by nurturing dissent can it ever take root and overcome the vast powers of authoritarian government .
Argumentative	 the promise of protection is hugely powerful because it gives bloggers a safety net to fall back on .
Argumentative	 those already active will feel more empowered to speak out against their oppressors , and some currently cowed by fear will have the courage to speak up .
Argumentative	 the guarantee of amnesty also removes the perceived randomness of such offerings that currently occur , as in the recent case of cuba in which two bloggers of similar pedigree asked for asylum in the us , but only one received it .
Argumentative	 such inconsistency has bred fear in the minds of dissidents .
Argumentative	 this policy would correct for it and help bolster the cause of justice on all fronts .
Argumentative	 it is through offering amnesty that democracies can provide the catalyst for the change they avow to be the paramount aim of human civilization .
Argumentative	 in offering amnesty western governments make an exceptionally powerful public statement in the international arena , an area in which they already hold great sway as norm-setters .
Argumentative	 it is a statement that shows that they will not simply ignore the abuses of power used by repressive regimes to stifle dissent and the voices of reform .
Argumentative	 ultimately , the power of oppressors to act with impunity is the product of democracies ' unwillingness to challenge them .
Argumentative	 authoritarian regimes often claim to value freedom of the press , for example articleof the constitution of the people 's republic of china guarantees it , and this policy challenges them to make their practice more like what they preach .
Argumentative	 a policy of amnesty for those threatened with the lash of tyranny serves to actively protect those people while at the same time upholding the avowed principles of justice and fairness the west proclaims .
Argumentative	 this will show that the west does not play favourites or turn a blind eye to these repressions , but is an active player , willing to step in to shield those who share its dreams of a freer world .
Argumentative	 the international ridicule these policies can generate will serve to shame regimes into relaxing their policies and to embrace at least a road to reform .
Argumentative	 nor should it be assumed that this rhetoric will have no real consequences , many authoritarian regimes encourage investment by companies from democratic countries , such investment is less likely when that company 's home state is publically condemning that state by granting amnesties to dissident bloggers .
