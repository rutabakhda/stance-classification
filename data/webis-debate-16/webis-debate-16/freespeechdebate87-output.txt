Non-Argumentative	access to information held by public bodies is a crucial component of freedom of expression and warrants a separate principle dedicated to it for several reasons.
Non-Argumentative	first, and most importantly, access to information held by public bodies, as well as by private entities that perform public functions or receive public funds, is essential if people are to be able to participate in informed debate; hold governments accountable; protect human rights, health, public safety, and the environment; and ensure access to public goods and services on an equitable basis.
Non-Argumentative	there are two broad categories of information that people need from the government.
Non-Argumentative	 we need information as consumers and users of government services, including how to access services and entitlements, and how to evaluate what services – hospitals, schools, means of transportation – are best for us.
Non-Argumentative	 the public, and especially the watchdogs, also need information about how government agencies are functioning – their budgets, their outputs, their policies, the salaries of officials, contracts for outsourcing, reports of oversight bodies – in order to evaluate whether agencies are providing value for money and complying with international law, and constitutional and statutory requirements.
Non-Argumentative	public agencies are particularly reluctant to make information available that the public could use to hold them, or key officials, accountable.
Non-Argumentative	 they may also not want to make some consumer information available simply because it’s cumbersome to compile and double-check, or because disclosure of the information could expose wrongdoing or mismanagement by entities that press for secrecy.
Non-Argumentative	 for instance, the us consumer agency for a long time resisted publishing complaints about products, citing the concern that some complaints might be ill-founded and that publishing the information could unfairly prejudice the manufacturer and/or lead to defamation actions.
Non-Argumentative	 the agency finally agreed to publish the information in junenoting that they would include a disclaimer.
Non-Argumentative	second, concepts such as the freedom to “receive and impart information and ideas”, mentioned in principledo not encompass the full meaning of  “access to information held by public bodies”.
Non-Argumentative	 the “freedom to receive and impart information”, set forth in the universal declaration of human rights and subsequent un and regional treaties, has generally been understood to apply only to the freedom of willing entities to exchange information free from government interference, but not to address the claims of citizens and others to get information from public bodies that those bodies don’t want to disclose.
Non-Argumentative	third, international and national experts, institutions and laws have only very recently affirmed that the right to freedom of expression includes a right of access to information held by public bodies.
Non-Argumentative	 for instance, only indid the un human rights committee declare that articleof the international covenant on civil and political rights embraces a right of access to information held by public bodies.
Non-Argumentative	 the committee, comprised ofexperts elected by un member states, is the body tasked with authoritatively interpreting and applying the covenant, a treaty that codifies parts of the universal declaration of human rights.
Non-Argumentative	 given the newness of the international recognition of this right, its importance, and the proclivity of governments to deny an obligation to make information available, a separate principle is warranted.
Non-Argumentative	accordingly, i would add a new principle, worded as follows:“we require information, including from public bodies, in order to be able to participate in informed debate; hold our governments accountable; protect our human rights, public safety, health and the environment; and ensure our access to public goods and services on an equitable basis.”
Non-Argumentative	that principle responds to the points above, and also implicitly makes two additional points.
Non-Argumentative	 first our need for information includes, but is not limited to, information held by public bodies.
Non-Argumentative	 the un human rights committee and numerous national laws recognise that people also need information from non-public entities that perform public functions, receive public funds, are substantially government-controlled or are established by law.
Non-Argumentative	 a few modern laws and constitutions, including south africa’s, recognise that people also may need information from any entity that impairs their rights.
Non-Argumentative	 second, the need for information held by public bodies is not limited to citizens; rather, it is a human right, which, as freedom of expression, has both an instrumental as well as an essential value.
Non-Argumentative	 it is as essential to our humanity and freedom to be able to make informed choices as it is to be able to express ourselves.
Non-Argumentative	 at the instrumental level, residents of a country (whether or not citizens), as well as individuals that are in other ways impacted by a government’s actions, certainly have a need and a right to information held by that government.
Non-Argumentative	finally, i also suggest that principleshould be expanded to expressly refer to freedom of information:“we must be free to challenge all limits to freedom of information and expression justified on such grounds as national security, public order and morality.”
Non-Argumentative	this addition makes clear that people must be allowed not only to express opinions that offend the government of the day, but also to challenge secrecy based on national security and related public interests.
Argumentative	sandra coliverdebaters notenick bibbythe primary advantage of putting the duty on government to publish , rather than on citizens to enquire is that it does not require the citizen to know what they need to know before they know it .
Argumentative	 publication en masse allows researchers to investigate areas they think are likely to produce results , specialists to follow decisions relevant to their field and , also , raises the possibility of discovering things by chance .
Argumentative	 the experience of wikipedia suggests that even very large quantities of data are relatively easy to mine as long as all the related documentation is available to the researcher -- the frustration , by contrast , comes when one has only a single datum with no way of contextualising it .
Argumentative	 any other situation , at the very least , panders to the interests of government to find any available excuse for not publishing anything that it is likely to find embarrassing and , virtually by definition , would be of most interest to the active citizen .
Argumentative	 genuine transparency and accountability of government action is not only in the interests of those who also have the right to vote for that government or who support it through the payment of taxes .
Argumentative	 the functioning of immigration services would seem to be a prime example .
Argumentative	 maximising access to information relating to government decisions by dint of its automatic publication of information relating to those decisions ensures that all those affected will have recourse to the facts behind any decision .
Argumentative	 required publication , by contrast , presents an even playing field to all parties .
Argumentative	 rather than allowing legislators to determine how and to whom -- and for what -- they should be accountable , a presumption in favour of publication makes them accountable to all .
Argumentative	 as a result , it is the only truly effective way of ensuring one of the key aims set out in favour of any freedom of information process .
