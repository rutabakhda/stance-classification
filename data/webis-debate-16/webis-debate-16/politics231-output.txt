Non-Argumentative	“we do not negotiate with terrorists.”
Non-Argumentative	 this is something we regularly hear, both in movies, and from governments.
Non-Argumentative	 in the hostage situation the gas field at amenas in january 2013, algeria communication minister mohamed said repeated algeria’s determination “we say that in the face of terrorism, yesterday as today as tomorrow, there will be no negotiation, no blackmail, no respite in the struggle against terrorism”.
Non-Argumentative	 algeria’s determination was in part due to its long history of terrorism in the country including a civil war fromtoin which up to 200,000 died against islamist groups such as the islamic salvation front (who had won an election).
Non-Argumentative	 the war was a guerrilla campaign and there were numerous massacres on both sides, not something that encourages a moderate attitude.
Non-Argumentative	 yet part of the reasoning may also have been that the terrorists in question were only threatening western hostages, they had said they only wanted the christians and infidels so the algerians in the gas complex were safe – possibly not the best way to coerce the algerian government.
Non-Argumentative	so what is a terrorist?
Non-Argumentative	 while there is no comprehensive definition that is recognised by everyone the united states defines international terrorism as activities that“(a) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the united states or of any state;(b) appear to be intended—(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and(c) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum;”c can be ignored as the question of whether to negotiate applies equally to domestic as international terrorism.
Non-Argumentative	 from the definition however the size of the attack does not matter, it can range from a stabbing in woolwich to the attack on the two towers or bigger.
Non-Argumentative	the key point of the definition is that the terrorists want something from the government and are using violent means to get it.
Non-Argumentative	 this means that there is clearly something that could be the subject of negotiation.
Non-Argumentative	 often the demands are not proportionate or the government is not in a position to answer the demands.
Non-Argumentative	 in the algerian example mentioned above the demands included an end to the french action in mali, something that the algerian government has no power over and would an immense demand if negotiating with the french government.
Non-Argumentative	 the other demands by the hostage takers was the release of islamists from algerian prisons and a safe corridor to the malian border, both are much more achievable by the algerians even if unpalatable.
Non-Argumentative	 this then could have been the basis of a negotiation.
Argumentative	 almost all terrorist groups kill people , whether innocents or members of the military .
Argumentative	 even those who limit casualties by giving warnings of their atrocities are unperturbed when they do end up taking lives .
Argumentative	 negotiation can then be the best way to save lives both in the short and long term .
Argumentative	 in the short term negotiating can mean a cease fire , and if there are hostages their release .
Argumentative	 over the long term negotiation is necessary if there is to be any peaceful conclusion to the conflict .
Argumentative	 as the right to life is the most fundamental right , and the duty of the states to protect its citizens is primary role of the state it is clear that the protection of these lives should be the main consideration for the state .
Argumentative	 when fighting terrorists the state either needs to answer some of the terrorists demands or fight back .
Argumentative	 when the state fights back the by the terrorists response is almost always more bloodshed using more and more extreme methods for example the first intifada was fought using sticks and stones , but when this , and the peace process that followed it failed , or rather did not show the results that was hoped for , the second was a major step up to suicide bombing .
Argumentative	 this is because when the terrorists fail they are unlikely to pack up ; instead they will try to find a bigger lever to course the state into making the move they want .
Argumentative	 in this case arafat hoped a round of violence would bring about concessions .
Argumentative	 the best way to prevent this cycle of violence is to negotiate , even if this is mostly to buy time .
Argumentative	 even when there is no cease fire there will be no reason for the terrorists to escalate if their demands are being taken seriously .
Argumentative	 in every terrorist movement there are different factions and disagreements about how best to achieve their collective aims , and often terrorist groups have either direct or indirect ties with political parties with whom they share the same goals .
Argumentative	 it is clearly then in the interest of the state to strengthen the more acceptable parts of the movement whether can seriously talk to .
Argumentative	 the only way to strengthen the moderates is to negotiate .
Argumentative	 this then makes their path to a solution the more credible course for the movement as a whole to take .
Argumentative	 to demonstrate a negative example the united states and israel were unwilling to negotiate with moderates within the plo for fifteen years during which time not only was there a lot more bloodshed but much more radical groups formed on the palestinian side making negotiations much more complicated in the long run as there would be multiple groups who would need to sign up to a final peace treaty .
Argumentative	 un secretary general kofi annan stated in`` terrorism will only be defeated if we act to solve the political disputes and long-standing conflicts which generate support for it .
Argumentative	 if we do not , we shall find ourselves acting as a recruiting sergeant for the very terrorists we seek to suppress . ''
Argumentative	 terrorist campaigns do n't just come out of nowhere , with the exception of some single individual acts , there is a grievance behind the acts .
Argumentative	 the terrorist is trying to have this grievance dealt with and believes the best way to this end is through violence .
Argumentative	 it is clear that the easiest way to end the conflict is simply to resolve the grievance .
Argumentative	 even when there are no negotiations the state will usually attempt to resolve some of these grievances , however doing so unilaterally will simply show that the terrorist 's violence is working without getting any guarantees of an end to the violence in return .
Argumentative	 negotiation therefore benefits both sides .
Argumentative	 it is notable that% of terrorist groups that have ended sincehave done so as a result of negotiations compared to only% being defeated militarily .
Argumentative	 just as negotiations strengthen the moderates they isolate those who are most radical and interested in a violent solution .
Argumentative	 this isolation is key to actually winning a fight against groups using terrorist methods because terrorists are almost always hiding within the community .
Argumentative	 the only way to prevent these acts is therefore to encourage their community to persuade the terrorists to reject violence , or if they are not willing to change to aid the state .
Argumentative	 the need for help from the community is recognised in almost all conflicts against terrorist groups and insurgencies .
Argumentative	 the state succeeds when it gets the moderates on board , this is shown by the conflict in iraq where the united states turned the tide against al qaeda in the al-anbar awakening .
Argumentative	 this victory was only made possible through the engagement and cooperation with local leaders who wanted an end to violence so were willing to talk to , and join with the us military if the result was likely to be security .
