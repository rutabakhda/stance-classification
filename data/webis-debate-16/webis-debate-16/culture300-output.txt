Non-Argumentative	the almost continuous growth of the industry is not without its side-effects.
Non-Argumentative	 following growing evidence of ecological damage at a number of the world’s most popular tourist sites, alongside fears about the impact of tourism upon regions’ populations, politics and natural resources, international organisations such as unesco have begun to look seriously at providing developing states with incentives to limit the number of tourists that they accept into their territory.
Argumentative	 tourism vastly increases income within a particular state or region , not only through direct spending by tourists , but also as a result of increases in tax revenue and the growth of local markets for food , services and luxury goods .
Argumentative	 tourism provides a boost to the amount of capital available in an area that purely local spending can not achieve , even if assisted by government subsidies or tax breaks for domestic businesses .
Argumentative	 in many developing states , tourism acts as an alternative to cash crops , improving terms of trade , both within the country 's internal market and with its neighbours .
Argumentative	 tourism helps to diversify economies , reducing reliance on finite or export-led economic activities such as mining and agricultural production .
Argumentative	 both farming and mineral extraction are largely dependent on export markets and the customs charges and cross-border trade agreements that facilitate them .
Argumentative	 tourism is set apart from this type of economic activity .
Argumentative	 the processes of production and exchange that define tourism take place within the host state itself , while the capital that drives these activities originates outside its borders .
Argumentative	 foreign corporate investment - in the form of casinos , hotels and travel ports - is supplemented by the commerce that it attracts .
Argumentative	 developing states can dictate the extent to which tourists ' spending is taxed , without having to make the concessions and trade-offs inherent in trading with other national entities .
Argumentative	 trading with tourists also gives states a supply-side advantage when it comes to selling luxury goods .
Argumentative	 as large business entities , importers are better able to use bulk purchasing and collective bargaining to acquire discounts on food stuffs , clothing and jewellery from nations with underdeveloped export economies .
Argumentative	 by contrast , trade with tourists allows a larger number of indigenous retailers to demand broadly higher prices -- tourists do not buy in bulk , nor do they bargain collectively .
Argumentative	 revenues from tourism can be used to enhance a developing state 's infrastructure , providing quantities of capital that may normally be out of reach to central government or to aid providers .
Argumentative	 via taxes levied on hotels , tourists and goods providers , funding can be generated for the construction of roads , hospitals , power stations and schools .
Argumentative	 reinvestment of this type can be used to spur further diversification within a state 's economy .
Argumentative	 it can make doing business within the state a more attractive proposition for foreign investors .
Argumentative	 forming close ties with resource extraction firms and manufacturers is a popular development strategy for many poorer states , but it offers significant disadvantages in comparison to tourism .
Argumentative	 not only does resource extraction , by its very nature , require states to consent to its territory sustaining pervasive and long-term environmental damage , it also tends to incentivise infrastructure projects that are only of use to the resource extraction industry .
Argumentative	 roads can ferry medical supplies to communities as easily as they ferry tourists .
Argumentative	 an oil pipeline will only ever be useful for transporting oil .
Argumentative	 tourists ' cash can be employed in efforts to reduce the negative externalities generated by leisure travel .
Argumentative	 ecological damage resulting from increased volumes of air and sea traffic and the construction of hospitality facilities is frequently cited as a reason to limit the growth of the tourism industry in developing nations .
Argumentative	 dependence on the industry for jobs and investment is seen as reducing the amount of control that developing states can exercise over potentially exploitative firms -- if a firm pulls out in response to assertive government action - taking jobs and money with it - that government will become unpopular .
Argumentative	 however , the more money that a state makes from tourism , the more money it has to invest in other sectors of its economy .
Argumentative	 by incentivising the development of alternative forms of business and employment , a state can feasibly release itself from dependence on the tourist trade .
Argumentative	 as profits from tourism grow , a state will become freer to dictate the terms on which tour operators , hotel owners and tourists themselves do business -- tourists ' money will have been used to create other sources of growth , investment and employment within that economy .
Argumentative	 managed properly , tourism and the conservation of wildlife habitats and areas of archaeological significance need not be mutually exclusive activities .
Argumentative	 indeed , recent trends in ecotourism have demonstrated that tourists themselves can be co-opted to monitor and survey the environments that they are visiting .
Argumentative	 the fees paid by tourists to gain access to heritage locations such as pompeii , the valley of kings and machu pichu can be funnelled into restoration and preservation schemes on those sites .
