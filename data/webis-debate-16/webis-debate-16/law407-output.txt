Non-Argumentative	the united states has not ratified the rome statute, the treaty that underpins the international criminal court.
Non-Argumentative	 while the icc does not have jurisdiction over actions in us territory, it does have jurisdiction where americans are on the territory of a state that has ratified the rome statute, or if the situation is referred by the un security council – referral of a case against the us being unlikely due to their permanent member veto.
Non-Argumentative	for this reason, the united states has sought for other nations to enter in to articleagreements, also known as bilateral immunity agreements, which declare that that state party will not send an american to the icc for trial.
Non-Argumentative	the legal basis for these agreements is an interpretation of article 98(2) of the rome statute, which states that the icc “may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested state to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending state is required to surrender a person of that state to the court, unless the court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending state for the giving of consent for the surrender”.
Non-Argumentative	 the primary intent behind article 98(2) has been argued to be to protect those subject to status of forces agreements, causing some to doubt the validity of articleagreements.
Non-Argumentative	  the us has taken a position insisting on icc state parties, other than nato members, “major non-nato allies” and taiwan, signing agreements using article 98(2) to shield americans from icc prosecution as a condition for some forms of military and developmental aid, under some circumstances.
Non-Argumentative	european countries that have entered into articleagreements with the united states include albania, bosnia-herzegovina, georgia, macedonia, montenegro and romania (which was signed before their accession to the european union, who oppose articleagreements and consider them illegal - the others are not eu member states).
Non-Argumentative	 albania and romania are members of nato, the rest are not, but may join in the future.
Non-Argumentative	should these states terminate their articleagreements with the united states, or continue with them?
Argumentative	 the european states have signed and ratified the icc statute and should honour it , to do otherwise makes a mockery of the icc which those states supported throughout its genesis and at least claim to continue to support .
Argumentative	 article was only intended to be a factor where there are other agreements such as status of forces agreements , an agreement entered in to between two states , one having military forces in the other voluntarily , such as british troops in germany .
Argumentative	 it was not meant as a broad-brush way for states being able to grant selective immunity to citizens of non-member states who have committed genocide or crimes against humanity inside the jurisdiction of an icc member state .
Argumentative	 signing an articleagreement is at best accepting foreign instigation of the abuse of process of a treaty .
Argumentative	 at worst it is accepting an illegal attempt at circumventing the treaty .
Argumentative	 the bilateral immunity agreements that these states have entered in to undermine the court that these states have signed up to .
Argumentative	 bias invalidate the intention for the icc that any person who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court , which only triggers when an individual is a citizen of a state that has ratified the rome statute , or in the territory of a rome statute state , and commits the horrific acts covered by the rome statute should be brought to trial by providing a get out clause for the powerful .
Argumentative	 a proliferation in bias could potentially render the icc a court that can only try nationals of small states that do not have the leverage to get others to agree to bias , already the icc is accused of bias in putting africans on trial and ignoring the rest of the world , such agreements make this worse .
Argumentative	 bias by one state , the united states , creates a precedent for other states to use and as they do so the field that is available for international criminal justice will become smaller and smaller .
Argumentative	 the united states has been accused of using bullying tactics in the pursuit of gaining articleagreements by , amongst others , human rights watch .
Argumentative	 this has included significant reductions in non-military , development aid , including to countries such as south africa , the bahamas and peru , as well as making threats to accession to nato in the case of croatia .
Argumentative	 by signing up to articleagreements , european nations help contribute to a climate where smaller nations can also be strong-armed in to harming the international criminal court by signing them , even if they were not subject to blackmailed in to it themselves .
