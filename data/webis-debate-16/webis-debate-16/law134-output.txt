Non-Argumentative	onjuly 1998, the rome statute establishing the international criminal court was signed.
Non-Argumentative	 pursuant to several decades of drafting and negotiation, the conference at rome settled the creation of a court with jurisdiction over the most heinous crimes ; namely, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc builds on the precedent of the ad hoc tribunals established by un security council resolutions in the 1990s.
Non-Argumentative	 the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty) and the international criminal tribunal for rwanda (ictr) are currently investigating and prosecuting those responsible for commission of some of the most grave violations of human rights in the twentieth century.
Non-Argumentative	 the establishment of the permanent and standing institution of the icc at the hague removed this complex process of negotiation; the difficulty of obtaining security council assent; and the perennial problem of securing funding.
Non-Argumentative	the objections raised, by the us specifically, concern the potential for political prosecution, the excessive jurisdiction, and the capacity for crippling costs to any state, whether already a signatory or a current opponent.
Argumentative	 however, the proponents of the court maintain it is necessary to ensure war criminals are brought to justice and, in so doing, offer justice to their victims.law-abiding states like the united states that have yet to ratify the icc should have nothing to fear if they behave lawfully .
Argumentative	 the prosecutor of the icc is only concerned with the most grave offences and it defies belief that the us would approve a strategy of genocide or systematic mass violations of human rights that could attract the jurisdiction of the icc .
Argumentative	 further , the discretion of the prosecutor is not unchecked .
Argumentative	 the statute requires that the approval of three judges sitting in a pre-trial chamber be obtained before an arrest warrant can be issued or proceedings initiated .
Argumentative	 moreover , there is no harm to the interests of the us in being subjected to a mere preliminary investigation .
Argumentative	 in fact , it is preferable that spurious accusations are briefly examined and shown to be baseless , than that these accusations be allowed to raise doubts about the credibility of a state 's actions and the impartiality of the tribunal in question .
Argumentative	 the us acceptance of the jurisdiction of the prosecutor of the icty is evident ; the us troops forming part of the kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo could equally be subject to investigation and prosecution by the icty .
Argumentative	 the us is prepared for its forces to operate under the scrutiny of the icty since it reasonably does not expect its members to commit the very crimes they are deployed to prevent .
Argumentative	 the icc offers a multilateral means by which international law can be brought to bear on the perpetrators of war crimes .
Argumentative	 as amnesty international argues , ` the icc ensures that those who commit serious human rights violations are held accountable .
Argumentative	 justice helps promote lasting peace , enables victims to rebuild their lives and sends a strong message that perpetrators of serious international crimes will not go unpunished ' .
Argumentative	 furthermore , and for the first time , the icc has the power to order a criminal to pay reparations to a victim who has suffered as a result of their crimes .
Argumentative	 such reparations may include restitution , indemnification and rehabilitation .
Argumentative	 judges are able to order such reparations whether the victims have been able to apply for them or not .
Argumentative	 though reparations will often not be sufficient on their own for lasting peace , they are a step in the right direction and only made possible by the establishment of the icc .
Argumentative	 upon signing the rome statute in, u.n. secretary general kofi annan stated that ` the establishment of the court is still a gift of hope to future generations , and a giant step forward in the march towards universal human rights and the rule of law '.
Argumentative	 such statements demonstrate the impact the court could potentially have , as a body that simultaneously cherishes sovereignty and protects national courts whilst offering a means by which criminals in states unable or unwilling to prosecute will still be brought to justice .
Argumentative	 as the natural and permanent heir to the process started at nuremberg in the wake of world war ii2 , the icc ensures that the reach of law is now universal ; war criminals , either in national or international courts , will be forced to trial as a result of the principle of universal jurisdiction1 .
Argumentative	 the deterrent effect of such a court is obvious and a warning to those who felt they were operating in anarchic legal environments .
