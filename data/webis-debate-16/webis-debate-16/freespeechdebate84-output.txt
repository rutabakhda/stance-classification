Non-Argumentative	pakistan’s blasphemy law is problematic on a number of levels.
Non-Argumentative	 firstly, in its current manifestation, section 295-c of the penal code does not include in its clauses the intention of using derogatory words against the prophet muhammad.
Non-Argumentative	 thus, from the onset, the onus of proving oneself innocent is placed upon the defendant.
Non-Argumentative	 this violates one of the most basic principles of any modern justice system i.e. the accused is innocent until proven guilty.
Non-Argumentative	debaters’ noteas with many debates relating to belief, especially religious belief, it is easy for debates related to blasphemy to get sidetracked into an argument as to whether blasphemy is a meaningful term.
Non-Argumentative	 it’s worth avoiding this route, as we shall see there are jurisprudential issues that apply regardless of the actuality or otherwise of blasphemy.
Argumentative	 many of these arguments also relate to debates of laws relating to other ‘thought crimes’.
Argumentative	blasphemy , by its nature , is ` all in the eye of the beholder ' .
Argumentative	 it is impossible , in most cases , to determine whether there was intent on the part of the accused and as a result it is difficult to codify in legislation .
Argumentative	 equally , unless the law takes a particular theological position , one person 's blasphemous slur is another 's sacred profession .
Argumentative	 it relies on the predicate that the person alleging blasphemy was offended or felt their faith was under attack .
Argumentative	 of course these offences are very real and may at times be possible to codify but they can not be applied universally because the perceptions they necessitate are not universal .
Argumentative	 in the light of this there may be many remedies for blasphemy but legislation in general and criminal sanctions in particular can not be appropriate .
Argumentative	 in the case of blasphemy , such harm can not be demonstrated .
Argumentative	 there is also an interesting point of whether god can be said to have been harmed and whether it is possible for a third party , other than the state , to act as a result of harm having been caused to another .
Argumentative	 as a result , since harm can not be proven and neither , in most cases , as we have seen in the previous argument , can intent be proven , it is difficult to see how blasphemy is anything other than free speech .
Argumentative	 it is far easier for other social groups -- sexual and political minorities , people of disabilities and others -- to prove both harm and intent of statements and actions but lack the legal protection given to religious organisations through blasphemy laws .
