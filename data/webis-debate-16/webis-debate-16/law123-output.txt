Non-Argumentative	everyone talks about 'rights', 'human rights' and 'fundamental rights', but do they even exist?
Non-Argumentative	 can we ever really know what they are?
Non-Argumentative	 are they objective facts, or are they just products of our time and culture?
Non-Argumentative	 what about competing ideas and definitions of human rights?
Non-Argumentative	 various attempts have been made to codify universal or fundamental human rights, but there exists no universally-followed list of rights.
Non-Argumentative	 our current conception of human rights has in one sense its origins in the conceptions of the 'rights of man' which emerged during the enlightenment, but owes most of its current form and content to ideas which emerged in the wake of the second world war, as embodied in the united nations'universal declaration of human rights, which listed a large number of political, economic and social rights supposedly universally held by all people everywhere.
Non-Argumentative	 this conception of human rights has been criticised, however, and the very idea of universal or fundamental human rights is by no means universally accepted by all nations and societies.
Argumentative	Â fundamental human rights exist and are founded on universal human needs .
Argumentative	 certain needs are necessary to human life in every instance and circumstance .
Argumentative	 these include food , water , shelter and security of person .
Argumentative	 human life is not possible without any one of these things , and so these needs may be termed ` fundamental rights ' necessary to the continued existence of that person .
Argumentative	 every person has a right to the fulfilment of these needs as the alternative is non-existence , which is contrary to our basic human nature to survive .
Argumentative	 because all humans everywhere possess at birth a drive to survive and all share these requirements , they are clearly fundamental to our nature and we have a right to their fulfilment and protection .
Argumentative	 certain desires , such as the desire for happiness , are universal to all human beings .
Argumentative	 even if they actively deny them to others , every individual works towards the fulfilment of these desires for himself , and recognise that the denial of this fulfilment is harmful to himself .
Argumentative	 for example historically slave-owners still desired freedom of movement and labour for themselves , even if they denied it to their slaves on the basis of selfish interests .
Argumentative	 therefore , because all humans desire happiness for themselves , and also desire the means to this end such as freedom of speech and the freedom to make their own choices , there exists a universal basis of desire for human rights in every individual .
Argumentative	 the enshrinement of ` fundamental human rights ' simply universalizes what every individual acknowledges for himself : that the denial of certain rights is always harmful .
Argumentative	 this already even has a basis in the ` golden rule ' , to not do what is harmful to yourself to others , which can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition .
Argumentative	 all humans benefit from the protection of the human rights of others .
Argumentative	 for example , a society which guarantees the security of person for all its inhabitants means every individual can feel assured of their safety and thus live a happier and more productive life , whereas in a society where this was not guaranteed to all , everyone would have to live in fear of their person being violated in the present if they can not guarantee their own security , or in the future if they should lose the ability to protect themselves which they may enjoy in the present .
Argumentative	 this fear would lower the quality of life for all , and make society worse .
Argumentative	 therefore , it could be argued that , even if fundamental human rights do not exist , it is still beneficial for us to believe in them and protect them , as we are all better off as a consequence .
Argumentative	 this applies internationally as well ; the conception of universal human rights which everyone possesses has meant that many modern instances of humanitarian disasters , such as the 1984-1985 famine in somalia , have been met with a vigorous response by nations , groups and individuals concerned with human rights , helping to alleviate the human suffering there .
Argumentative	 this can be compared to historical examples in times when there was less concern with universal human rights and where therefore much less action was taken to alleviate famines and human suffering , such as occurred in the irish potato famine betweenand.
