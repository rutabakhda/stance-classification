Non-Argumentative	modern nations such as australia, canada, and the united states have struggled in their efforts to establish a fair and stable relationship with aboriginal, or indigenous, groups.
Non-Argumentative	 in the past three hundred years, the aforementioned governments have often abused these groups through unfair and broken treaties, reckless dissemination of disease, and often direct violence.
Non-Argumentative	 consequently, these groups make up a small portion of the population today and are often plagued by problems with substance abuse and poor quality of life.
Non-Argumentative	 governments also struggle to establish a fair level of jurisdiction over said groups; while these nation-states recognize that indigenous groups were forced to submit to the government's authority, they are not willing to let indigenous groups break any law they dislike.
Non-Argumentative	 this centers on the question of whether governments should act to preserve indigenous culture; this protection can take the form of land reservations set aside for aboriginals.
Non-Argumentative	 however, it can also include language programs or funding for the arts so that, despite heavy losses in numbers over the generations, the remainder of these indigenous groups is able to pass down their culture.
Non-Argumentative	 protection of indigenous culture may also include special legal exemption from particular laws that are contrary to indigenous traditions.
Argumentative	 while many argue that aboriginals are entitled to special treatment because of a blemished past, others argue that this past is not a valid reason for special cultural protection.
Argumentative	across the united states , australia , and canada , native customs are often tied closely to the land .
Argumentative	 for example , while descendants of the sioux indians of the american midwest may no longer hunt buffalo , learning about traditional means of hunting , animal use , rituals involving the surrounding wildlife , means of ensuring a sustainable food supply , and other cultural norms related to the land gives people a greater appreciation for the land they now inhabit .
Argumentative	 exposure to traditions that have been practiced in one 's land for thousands of years helps us to appreciate the legacy we have inherited .
Argumentative	 this does not just benefit the direct descendants of those practicing these traditions but the whole of society .
Argumentative	 the indian removal act of, theindian appropriations act , and thegeneral allotment act are just a few examples of legislation used to destroy native american communities in the us2 .
Argumentative	 settlers in australia are similarly responsible for a multitude of massacres3 , as well as several decades of forced separation of aboriginal children from their parents in an effort to `` christianize '' them4 .
Argumentative	 while the current citizens of canada , the us , and australia are not guilty of the crimes of their predecessors , they nevertheless reap the benefits of those atrocities while today 's indigenous populations still suffer from the lasting impact of oppression .
Argumentative	 when chemical companies make huge profits at the expense of damaging the surrounding community 's environment , those companies are expected to pay reparations .
Argumentative	 a government that destroys an indigenous culture must similarly work to reverse their destruction .
Argumentative	 notions of cultural superiority virtually always influence displacement and abuse of indigenous cultures .
Argumentative	 for example , when the government of botswana expelled the kalahari bushmen from their land in, president mogai defended his actions by describing the bushmen as `` stone age creatures .
Argumentative	 ``this cultural insensitivity , in addition to the incentive of material gains , led the botswani government to violate the tribe 's rights .
Argumentative	 by preserving indigenous culture , governments recognize the value of these groups and prevent future hostility .
Argumentative	 governments already protect culture so it is not a big step to apply the same protections to aboriginal culture as well .
Argumentative	 in school , students learn about traditional art and their national history .
Argumentative	 for example , the state of california compiles reading lists that largely include shakespeare , virgil , and john steinback , though also including ethnic authors like maya angelou1 .
Argumentative	 governments recognize days like christmas and new years and fund programs that promote the arts .
Argumentative	 states recognize marriage and structure divorce and custody laws based on cultural norms of gender roles and family responsibility .
Argumentative	 if a government can protect the norms on one culture in society , there is no reason that the government should not also protect the culture of those who first inhabited the land .
Argumentative	 this current protection makes it easy to build on , to make highlight more aboriginal culture , recognize their festivals etc,
