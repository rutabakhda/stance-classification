Non-Argumentative	605 million people in the world are estimated to know how to play chess: overmillion are registered competitively, representing overcountries.1 despite its presence throughout history and geography, and despite having been recognised as a sport by the international olympic committee in 1999, chess has never been a discipline in the olympic games.
Non-Argumentative	the world chess federation (fide) has been campaigning for years for this to happen.
Non-Argumentative	 its first attempt infailed because of problems distinguishing amateur from professional chess players2, since the olympic games were originally restricted to amateurs.
Non-Argumentative	 now, however, this criterion has been dropped.3 sincechess has also been accepted into the asian games, the world's second biggest multi sport games which is organised by the olympic council of asia and recognised by the international olympic committee, as a part of the category of board games which also includes weiqi (go) and xiangqi (chinese chess).4yet there are still obstacles to chess being included in the olympics.
Non-Argumentative	 it is still rarely perceived as a sport, not to mention an olympic sport, and the olympic games have a limited capacity regarding how many sports they can include.
Non-Argumentative	 why then should chess, a mind sport rather than a conventional sport, be included in future games?
Argumentative	[2] brace, edward r. “an illustrated dictionary of chess”, hamlyn publishing group, p. 64, 1977.
Argumentative	chess is not a predominantly physical sport , yet neither are shooting and curling , which , in fact , has been nicknamed `` chess on ice ''.
Argumentative	 the opposition may respond that the determining factor in these is still physical , such as speed and precision .
Argumentative	 however , chess too requires precise calculation in short periods of time .
Argumentative	 there is no relevant distinction to be drawn between the human brain and other organs : both can be trained and strained , and doing so should be equally rewarded .
Argumentative	 more importantly , taekwondo is a further example of what may be called a mind sport .
Argumentative	 as in chess , both participants have the same set of moves which can be combined in a near infinite number of ways : it thus becomes a battle of intellect and strategy rather than strength .
Argumentative	 the body merely becomes the vessel through which to compete , precisely as a chess board .
Argumentative	 although the vessels are different , the fundamental activity is the same , and thus if taekwondo is valid as an olympic sport , so should chess be .
Argumentative	 when the ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau stated that `` mind sports , by their nature , can not be part of the program '', she contradicted olympic history .
Argumentative	 the ancient greek panhellenic games , forerunners of the modern olympic games , indeed emphasised musical , theatrical and painting competitions .7 even the modern olympic games had non-physical competitions such as painting , design and poetry betweenand 1952.8 through chess , the cultural and mental aspect now lost in the olympic games is protected .
Argumentative	 the limits of human capability can be investigated from a new , intellectual , angle .
Argumentative	 this would allow the games to celebrate , as intended , human potential in its entirety .
Argumentative	 the sports in the olympics promote good values : they display attributes and disciplines that we want to encourage in society and children in particular .
Argumentative	 chess is no different from this .
Argumentative	 numerous studies have shown that chess has large cognitive benefits , strengthening a wide range of skills : problem-solving , decision-making , memory , mathematics , logic , and creative thinking .9 ,these are skills we want to actively promote , and thus if including chess in the olympics would increase its support , we should do so .
Argumentative	 making chess an olympic sport would make it more accessible to people who would otherwise not watch it .
Argumentative	 it would also incentivise young enthusiasts to become more involved in the hope of participating in such a recognised competition .
Argumentative	 bringing chess to a highly recognised event would doubtless increase support , and thus have an objectively positive impact on society .
Argumentative	 chess is among the sports with the greatest number of federations and of active participants worldwide .12 its large fan base , however , is completely unrepresented in the world 's largest sports competition .
Argumentative	 chess , furthermore , is highly viewer friendly , so its popularity would only flourish from its representation .
Argumentative	 it is possible to broadcast any game online , for all to watch at home .
Argumentative	 games also often feature high commentary action explaining and analysing the players ' strategies , to make them approachable and exciting to the public .
Argumentative	 furthermore , it could take the shape of a team sport in the olympics , leaving greater space for tactics and discouraging draws , once again making it more appealing for a broad audience .
