Non-Argumentative	in syria there have now been almost two years of conflict between the ba’ath party of syrian president bashar al-assad and a fractured arab spring inspired rebellion that incorporates a broad syrian national coalition, kurds and mujahideen from around the middle east.
Non-Argumentative	 it is now clear that intervention from outside the country, beyond the provision of weapons, will only happen if there is a major change in the situation on the ground.
Non-Argumentative	 nato and the united states have shown little inclination to intervene in any capacity on their own while russia and china prevent any un action that they believe might be opening the way to overthrowing president assad’s regime.
Non-Argumentative	the united states however says that it does have red lines, which if crossed, will result in more us action.
Non-Argumentative	 in august obama stated “we have been very clear to the assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.
Non-Argumentative	  that would change my calculus.
Non-Argumentative	  that would change my equation.”
Non-Argumentative	 chemical weapons are about the last possible line that has yet to be crossed in the brutal civil war where the united nations estimates 60,000 people have died.
Non-Argumentative	there are of course significant difficulties with the use of chemical weapons by the syrian government being a red line that triggers intervention or some other form of reaction; most particularly how do we know when they are used?
Non-Argumentative	 the use of chemical weapons my not be easy to spot from a satellite, and reports from either side on the ground would be inevitably biased if there are to be such consequences.
Non-Argumentative	 this question is important because there are accusations that chemical weapons have been used already.
Non-Argumentative	 the us consul general in istanbul has sent the state department a report that states "we can't definitely saypercent, but syrian contacts made a compelling case that agentwas used in homs on dec. 23".
Non-Argumentative	 the accusation is that a chemical weapon called agentwas used.
Non-Argumentative	 as chemical weapons go this is not a particularly nasty one; the attack caused five deaths and aboutsevere respiratory, nervous system, and gastrointestinal ailments.
Non-Argumentative	 the number of deaths however is not particularly relevant if it means stepping over us red lines.
Non-Argumentative	the state department however says “we believe syria's chemical weapons stockpile remains secured by the syrian government” and that they “found no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used” so for the moment we still do not know if chemical weapons have been used or not.
Non-Argumentative	either way the international community must be considering what it will do if it becomes clear that chemical weapons have been used or if they are used more widely.
Non-Argumentative	 syria is thought to have one of the biggest chemical weapons arsenals in the world and may well also have biological weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 it probably has large quantities of vx and had before the start of the civil war at least four large chemical weapons production facilities.
Non-Argumentative	if chemical weapons are going to be used, or have been used, should there be intervention?
Argumentative	 if syria uses , or looks as if it is about to use , chemical weapons then this would be a clear escalation that would require action .
Argumentative	 syria has never signed the chemical weapons convention but it should be considered to be a part of customary international law so binding even on those who have not signed .
Argumentative	 the use of chemical weapons would also clearly be an attempt to cause huge numbers of casualties and large scale suffering .
Argumentative	 inwith the united nations world summit the nations of the world signed up to `` if a state is manifestly failing to protect its populations , the international community must be prepared to take collective action to protect populations . ''
Argumentative	 so any intervention would be fully justifiable , and indeed should occur as syria would be demonstrating that it is `` failing to protect its populations '' by using chemical weapons on them .
Argumentative	 there is no doubt that the world has a moral responsibility to prevent atrocities in syria , these atrocities are already happening , but the world can not stand by while the syrian government escalates their scale through the use of chemical weapons .
Argumentative	 not responding to syrian moves to use chemical weapons will be enabling the syrian government to use chemical weapons .
Argumentative	 it has already been reported that some chemical weapons are being made ready for use such as the combining of the two chemical precursors , isopropanol and methylphosphony difluoride , needed to weaponize sarin gas .
Argumentative	 it means that `` physically , they 've gotten to the point where the can load it up on a plane and drop it '' .
Argumentative	 if there is no response to this then syria will be more likely to use weapons .
Argumentative	 if there is no response to the limited use of chemical weapons , such as the use of agentin homs , then there the regime will be encouraged to think that there will be no response to larger uses of chemical weapons .
Argumentative	 syria would slowly escalate to see what it can get away with , an escalation that us officials think could `` lead to a mass-casualty event '' without the appropriate response .
Argumentative	 one of the reasons why there has not been an intervention in syria already is the difficulty of doing so .
Argumentative	 preventing or limiting the use of chemical weapons however does represent a defined objective that is smaller , and therefore easier , than bringing peace to syria .
Argumentative	 it however has to be accepted that if assad 's regime is determined to use chemical weapons then some are likely to get through and how much is prevented is largely dependent on intelligence .
Argumentative	 interdicting chemical weapons during transport and bombing the storage facilities to make it much more difficult to move the weapons would be easiest to accomplish .
Argumentative	 but if chemical weapons are about to be used then attacking the delivery vehicles would be necessary ; any intervention would have overwhelming air superiority so would prevent the option of aircraft and helicopters being used to deliver the weapons .
Argumentative	 more difficult to destroy are ballistic missiles , and particularly artillery but even these are much easier to hit than infantry would be .
Argumentative	 in the conflict against gaddafi successfully used precision guided weapons to destroy tanks and artillery .
Argumentative	 moreover an intervening force would not need to destroy every missile and artillery brigade only find those that are being issued with chemical weapons .
