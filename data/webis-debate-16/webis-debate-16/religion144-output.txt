Non-Argumentative	the majority of the population of the world is at least nominally committed to some religion or another.
Non-Argumentative	 and despite the perception in some parts of the western world that religious belief is in terminal decline, or that economic and social development go hand in hand with secularisation, there are many parts of the world where fundamentalist religious belief is firmly entrenched (including arguably the most ‘developed’ nation on earth, the usa).
Non-Argumentative	 religious belief, it seems, refuses to go away.
Non-Argumentative	 some people might think that religion is not an appropriate topic for debate – perhaps because it is too personal, too sacred, or outside the realms of rational debate.
Non-Argumentative	 for the rest of us, however, there is a fascinating and lively debate to be had.
Non-Argumentative	 there are many different dimensions to debates about religion.
Non-Argumentative	 to start with there is the philosophical question of how plausible belief in god is.
Non-Argumentative	 then there are social, moral, and political questions about the effects of religious belief on individuals and communities both in the present and historically.
Non-Argumentative	 has religious belief, on balance, been a force for good or for harm in the world?
Non-Argumentative	 this is an enormous area.
Non-Argumentative	the arguments below provide only the most basic of skeletons.
Non-Argumentative	 it is for debaters themselves to do research and find their own examples from the present and from history to substantiate and illustrate the arguments.
Non-Argumentative	 this can range across many areas such as: is it necessary for god to work in miracles in order to exist?
Non-Argumentative	 and why does his existence need to be proven?
Non-Argumentative	 if you were somewhere else, outside of the parameters of human sight, would you need a human being to verify your existence?
Non-Argumentative	 isn't evidence also interpretation and dependent on interpreting data?
Non-Argumentative	 if god is everything, like some people say, then aren't all living and non living things proof of god?
Non-Argumentative	 so then why is there punishment?
Non-Argumentative	 if good and evil is needed for the development of human beings, then why is it punishable by god?
Non-Argumentative	 he created this entity called evil and as a result, we may unknowingly or knowingly choose it.
Non-Argumentative	 do we blame a clock for not working properly or do we blame the creator of it?
Non-Argumentative	 why is it different with god, given that he is the ultimate decider of everything?
Non-Argumentative	 how can free will truly be free if it is being judged?
Non-Argumentative	 how can it be free choice if one choice is clearly favoured over another?
Non-Argumentative	 science has uncovered all mysteries?
Non-Argumentative	 how do you know this?
Non-Argumentative	 where did the energy needed for the big bang come from?
Non-Argumentative	 did this energy always exist or were they created out of nothing?
Non-Argumentative	 if energy always existed then matter is eternal if they didn't then shouldn't something have to account for their existence in a logical sense?
Non-Argumentative	 are there really no more questions?
Non-Argumentative	 does proving religion wrong prove the non-existence of a creator?
Non-Argumentative	 what about conscience?
Non-Argumentative	 do we not have the capacity to tell right from wrong?
Non-Argumentative	 and what is your definition of right or wrong?
Non-Argumentative	 is it determined through reason or is it determined through what you have been told?
Non-Argumentative	 is it absolute or relative?
Non-Argumentative	 doesn't religion in some cases accept, even order certain acts that would be considered wrong in many other situations?
Argumentative	 why is it justified as right simply because it is ordained by religion?
Argumentative	there is no evidence that god exists .
Argumentative	 reported miracles , healings etc. are never reliably proved actually to have happened , and in any case everyone 's religious experiences are different and point to the psychological differences between human beings not to any objective divine reality .
Argumentative	 belief in god is simply wish-fulfilment .
Argumentative	 it would be nice if there was a loving all powerful being watching over us , but there is n't .
Argumentative	 the world is full of suffering and pain among innocent people .
Argumentative	 if god is good and all-powerful then why is this the case ?
Argumentative	 either god does not exist or he is not worth believing in since he does not care about human suffering .
Argumentative	 science provides us with the tools to form a comprehensive view of the universe which does not include a supernatural being .
Argumentative	 from galileo to darwin to the modern day , scientists have continually uncovered the true natural mechanisms behind the creation and evolution of the universe .
Argumentative	 there are no gaps left for god to act in - science has revealed a closed natural order governed by natural laws .
Argumentative	 brain science has shown that there is not a ` soul ' but that all our mental states are simply caused by brain activity .
Argumentative	 there is , therefore , no reason to believe in life after death - one of the main tenets of religious belief .
Argumentative	 religions through the ages , and still today , have been agents of repression , sexism , elitism , homophobia , and - most of all - conflict , war , and racial hatred .
Argumentative	 the very nature of belief in received wisdom means that it must be , at its core , a conservative and regressive force .
Argumentative	 moreover the positive moral rules that religions claim to promote tend to have existed independently of those religions -- the world did not have to wait for the ten commandments to learn that murder and theft was wrong , but it waited until the 19th century to reach a consensus that slavery was wrong .
Argumentative	 whatever small amount of psychological comfort religious belief may give , the evils it is responsible for in the social and political worlds easily outweigh it .
Argumentative	 with regards to any proposition the only consistent and rational view is to assume that it is not true unless sufficient evidence is put forward to nullify that assumption .
Argumentative	 the proposition need also be falsifiable , that is to say , there must be some potential fact that could be proven in order to disprove it .
Argumentative	 god is unfalsifiable because there is nothing .
