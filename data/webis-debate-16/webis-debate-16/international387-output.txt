Non-Argumentative	in july 2002, the fifty-three members of the organization of african unity (oau) disbanded that organization and inaugurated the african union (au).
Non-Argumentative	 the goal of the au is to create an international organization similar to the european union.
Non-Argumentative	 the oau itself says its objectives are “to rid the continent of the remaining vestiges of colonization and apartheid; to promote unity and solidarity among african states; to coordinate and intensify cooperation for development; to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states and to promote international cooperation within the framework of the united nations.”
Non-Argumentative	 it is to have a central bank, to be fully functioning by 2028, and a shared currency.
Non-Argumentative	 already there is a pan-african parliament, an african court of justice and an african "peace and security council" has been created.
Non-Argumentative	the au is, in part, the brainchild of libya’s now deposed muammar qaddafi who withdrew libya from the arab league.
Non-Argumentative	 qaddafi regularly called for a united states of africa, possibly with him as its first president.
Non-Argumentative	 he had also suggested a unified african gold dinar as a currency with the intention that it would be based on gold rather than the us dollar.
Non-Argumentative	 qaddafi’s downfall does not leave the idea entirely without support as other states such as eritrea, ghana, senegal and zimbabwe has shown interest.
Non-Argumentative	 despite qaddafi leaving the scene the idea of a “united and integrated” africa has not been abandoned, although it is likely the original timescale of it being done bywill likely have to be extended.
Argumentative	 integration can bring peace ; just like the european union has in europe .
Argumentative	 since the fall of the berlin wall , the un has slowly changed its relationship with regional organizations .
Argumentative	 it is more willing and through its agenda for peace has been demanding that regional organizations be responsible for peacekeeping , state-building and humanitarian assistance .
Argumentative	 part of the reasoning is that these states are more sensitive to local customs , concerns and diplomacy .
Argumentative	 already , the african union has taken on several peacekeeping initiatives ; first in burundi in 2003m and more recently on-going missions in in darfur , sudan , sinceand in somalia since.
Argumentative	 the au also allows regional economic communities to take a lead in responding threats to peace so allowing action to be taken at the appropriate level .
Argumentative	 while african integration has been slow there has been real progress in constructing the building blocks to allow further integration .
Argumentative	 african countries are already somewhat integrated : for examplecountries in west and central africa use the cfa franc as currency and there are regional blocks in west africa and east africa .
Argumentative	 the existence of these regional free trade areas the economic community of central african states , eccas , the economic community of west african states , ecowas , the east african community , eac , common market for eastern and southern african countries , comesa , and the southern african development community , sadc , will eventually provide the springboard for further integration throughout the whole of africa .
Argumentative	 the latter three of these communities have signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on integration and harmonise areas such as trade .
Argumentative	 more importantly , despite problems with the creation of a single currency , the eu remains a good model for the au : no one would suggest that the eu is in danger of being disbanded .
Argumentative	 though its members might have differences as to its exact structure , that debate is no different than in any other confederation .
Argumentative	 for some commentators , africa 's biggest problem is that its countries are remnants of colonial empires .
Argumentative	 in the post-colonial period , borders were drawn between states randomly , creating ethnic tension and geographic dissonance .
Argumentative	 qaddafi argued that peace will break out when africa 's borders disappear .
Argumentative	 as saadi touval argued `` the borders are blamed for the disappearance of a unity which supposed existed in africa in precolonial times ... the borders are considered to be one of the humiliating legacies of colonialism , which , according to this view , independent africa ought to abolish '' .
Argumentative	 though unification is the end goal , the short-term objective is to create an african free trade area with some semblance of regional organization .
Argumentative	 most importantly , the au has abandoned the notion of absolute `` state sovereignty '' : it can `` peer review '' the human rights and political situation in any of its members .
Argumentative	 the eu was established after wwii to assist in the rebuilding of europe ; why ca n't the au do the same in africa ?
