Non-Argumentative	campaign finance has always been a point of contention in american politics and the subject of a great deal of media attention every election cycle, because american political campaigns are particularly long and incredibly expensive.
Non-Argumentative	  money is needed to pay staff, buy media advertisement, and even raise more money.
Non-Argumentative	 presidential campaigns often cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Non-Argumentative	 senate and congressional campaigns can cost several million dollars.
Non-Argumentative	 in parliamentary democracies with smaller districts and shorter election cycles (or more irregular election cycles), the costs could be different and less significant.
Non-Argumentative	campaign finance reform (cfr) began in earnest in the post-watergate era in the united states with the passage of the federal election campaign act which created the federal election commission (fec), implemented disclosure requirements, donation limits, and federal financing of presidential elections.
Non-Argumentative	 the landmark supreme court decision of buckley v. valeo (1976) struck down the controversial provision of spending limits, as well as a provision of the law that limited the amount of personal money someone could spend on their own campaign.
Non-Argumentative	 eventually, this system of laws unraveled as the supreme court affirmed that political parties, labor unions, and political action committees(pacs) could spend unlimited amounts of “soft money” - spending not directly associated with a candidate’s campaign, such as broad issue advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and party building strategies.
Non-Argumentative	 pacs are types of organisations that campaign for or against candidates and are allowed to receive limited contributions from individuals but not from corporations and unions.
Non-Argumentative	however, ina landmark case came before the supreme court, citizens united v fec, which overturned a provision of the bipartisan campaign reform act that prohibited corporations and labor unions from airing issue advocacy advertisements during the weeks immediately preceding an election.
Non-Argumentative	  furthermore, it overturned a prior supreme court decision that prohibited corporations and unions from engaging in direct advocacy – that is, advertisements that directly encourage citizens to vote for or against a candidate.
Non-Argumentative	 along with other related court decision, this decision is connected to the formation of super pacs.
Non-Argumentative	  super pacs, in turn, are organizations that can receive unlimited individual, corporate, and labor union contributions to influence elections but may not co-ordinate with their chosen candidate’s campaign.
Non-Argumentative	  total super pacs spending onelections reached $567,498,628 which invokes doubts over the integrity, corruption, and accountability of candidates to their constituency in comparison to their contributors.
Non-Argumentative	 super pacs are required by law to disclose the names of their donors and the amounts that people have donated.
Non-Argumentative	 there have been other recent setbacks in bringing transparency to us politics, the disclose act for example was blocked by the republicans, but there has been legislation requiring on air identification of all advertisers.
Non-Argumentative	bearing these events in mind, this debate will be looking at a campaign finance reform on whether corporations and individuals should be permitted to make unlimited contributions; whether corporations deserve the same political and/or speech rights as individuals; and whether those who engage in issuing advertisements should disclose their donors in the advertisements.
Argumentative	   currently , super pacs are organizations that can receive unlimited contributions , which encourages the belief that the amount of money contributed is directly correlated to the amount of influence the donor could have .
Argumentative	 by permitting individuals or corporations to make unlimited contributions , the current legislation undermines the democratic character of the elective process .
Argumentative	 political figures related to the sponsored super pacs have an incentive to satisfy the needs of those who contribute huge amounts of funding towards their campaign rather than meet the needs of the average citizen .
Argumentative	 this is not the way that democracy should be ; it must represent the viewpoint and needs of the majority of the population , not just the small fraction of it that is wealthy enough to effectively pay for policies they want .
Argumentative	 furthermore , caps on contributions to super pacs will bring competition in elections back into the mainstream and when more citizens contribute to politicians , they will be more engaged in politics .
Argumentative	 for example , the pass of the bipartisan campaign reform act , bcra , eliminated soft money for parties and attempted to handle the elections contributions through pacs .
Argumentative	 with the elimination of soft money for parties , the role of interest groups investment decreased in the 1990s .
Argumentative	 obama 's campaign inraised 114.1 million or% of his general election fund from small contributions .
Argumentative	 his unprecedented small donor fundraising success can be interpreted as increased credibility and public visibility for obama and through this the benefit of mobilizing lots of small donations .
Argumentative	 in, obama used online communications and social networking tools to reach and mobilise more people .
Argumentative	 in effect of this approach , he not only inspired an unprecedented number of young and retired people to get involved in the campaign , but also achieved the highest rate of small contributions .
Argumentative	 when a corporation and an individual are both trying to achieve the same goal , they should be able to do so in the same way .
Argumentative	 it would be unfair if the campaign finance reform limits the amount that an individual could contribute , but not that of a corporation when it is apparent that corporations are contributing considerably larger amounts than individuals as seen in the case of the pharmaceutical industry .
Argumentative	 corporations need to have the same rights and limitations on campaign contributions and economic freedom .
Argumentative	 this was why the us supreme court ruled that the federal ban on spending by corporations was unconstitutional under the first amendment act in.
Argumentative	 this led to the super pacs because they represent an association of people and have the right to freedom of speech and political preference .
Argumentative	 reforms , such as bipartisan campaign reform act , bcra , may have been successful in curtailing interest groups role as investors in campaigns , they failed when it comes to candidate advocacy as a result of super pacs .
Argumentative	 such regulations that limit large-scale political spending from interest groups serves to limit speech crucial to political groups without a broad base of support or political entrepreneurs like swift boat veterans for truth that got its message aired when the national media was ignoring the issue .
Argumentative	 moreover , bans on corporate contributions did not prevent alternative ways for candidate advocacy , such as the private satellite radio station of the national rifle association or the movies made by the citizens united these alternative ways could undermine the principle of fair and transparent campaigns more than the lack of such limit on spending from individuals and corporations and their political expression .
Argumentative	 a further reform limiting super pacs would have the effect of leveling the playing field for candidates .
Argumentative	 candidates with enormous leadership potential but small wallets have failed due to the lack of resources .
Argumentative	 under a reformed campaign finance system , it will be more difficult for well-financed candidates to win purely because of the money they have .
Argumentative	 incumbent candidates have a unique advantage over challengers in the present system because of their direct connections to important sources of money .
Argumentative	 campaign finance reform will make elections more competitive and thus enhance higher turnover or `` fresh blood '' in politics .
Argumentative	 this is essential for challenging old orthodoxies and bringing in new ideas .
Argumentative	 it will also make it easier for members of ethnic minorities and the working class to seek office - such groups are disproportionately deterred from candidacy by the current need to raise large sums of money .
Argumentative	 quantitative analysis of elections involving incumbents from twenty-five states across three election cycles indicate that more stringent campaign finance laws increase the likelihood of new challengers to the current incumbent .
Argumentative	 financing laws limiting fundraising increase the likelihood of minority-party and independent challengers and produce higher rate of election competition .
Argumentative	 as a result challengers feel they have better chances against the incumbents .
Argumentative	 campaign finance reform gives the individual donor a voice more comparable to other donors ' interests .
Argumentative	 at present , the enormous amount of money channeled into campaigns by large corporations , unions , and special interest groups through pacs overwhelm the smaller , limited contributions of individual donors .
Argumentative	 reforming the super pacs and limiting these large group donations would increase the significance of donations by individual voters , likely increasing the responsiveness of candidates to voters/donors and so increasing their accountability to their electorate .
Argumentative	 additionally , the increased significance of individual contributions encourages voter participation and activism .
Argumentative	 allowing anonymity of contribution to `` issue ads '' and to super pacs only amplifies the corrosive effect money has on american politics .
Argumentative	 without knowing where the funding for particular `` issue ads '' come from , the intentions of contributors can be obfuscated and issues can be easily branded into political palatable campaigns by allowing contributors to keep themselves and their agendas hidden .
Argumentative	 using names such as the `` america future fund '' and the `` coalition of american seniors '' political allegiances and agendas are hidden from view , removing a much needed critical evaluation of those who contribute and what their ends are .
Argumentative	 further to this , the anonymity of super pacs make it easy for foreign contributors , who are banned by us law from contributing to campaigns , to secretly contribute to campaigns , helping to skew american democracy by giving undue political influence to foreign corporations and their interests .
Argumentative	 anonymity of super pacs allows people to obfuscate their intentions and turn campaigns into opaque propaganda , removing the capacity for proper democracy and political debate .
