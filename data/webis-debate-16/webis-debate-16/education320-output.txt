Non-Argumentative	the debate between "comprehensive sex education" (also just called "sex education") and "abstinence-only education" is long-standing in the united states, and exists in many other societies around the world that are split between more sexually progressive groups and those that generally oppose pre-marital sex.
Non-Argumentative	 comprehensive sex education programs, at least in the united states, generally emphasise that abstaining from sex is the safest way to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
Non-Argumentative	 however, comprehensive programs differ from abstinence-only programs in that they also encourage the use of condoms or other forms of contraception.
Non-Argumentative	   abstinence-only programs are much more conservative and limited in scope, teaching abstinence from sex, usually until marriage, as a means of avoiding the risk of pregnancy and stds and of enjoying other considered benefits such as a more unique sexual bond with one's ultimate partner.
Non-Argumentative	when constructing affirmative and negative cases, debaters should consider the wide range of perspectives from which these issues can be understood.
Non-Argumentative	 this brings together many fields of study, including sexual culture, marital culture, faith, human instincts, pregnancy, disease, and parental-school-state roles.
Non-Argumentative	 debaters should also be clear exactly what they are arguing for.
Non-Argumentative	 although abstinence-only programs are generally thought of as quite conservative, this need not prevent an affirmative team including the discussion of stis and their effects as part of these programs.
Non-Argumentative	 opposition side teams should be prepared to discuss the social and value-led implications of teaching children about the threat of stis in order to deter them from engaging in pre-marital sex.
Non-Argumentative	affirmative debaters should be prepared for negative debaters who attempt to argue that the affirmative team should advocate fairly traditional abstinence-programs, and cannot design a program so liberal as to be nearly identical to sex-ed programs.
Non-Argumentative	debaters should also consider what age group they are discussing: the arguments for abstinence-only with young children may be substantially different than those with older teenagers.
Argumentative	 given that the resolution does not specify the age range, it is up to the affirmative to either defend abstinence-only in general in primary and secondary schools, or to provide solid justification for limiting the debate.
Argumentative	abstinence programs teach teenagers how to have meaningful , age-appropriate relationships , and help young people fight the pressure of having sex before they are ready .
Argumentative	 we live in a highly sexualized culture , and yet many girls report feeling guilty or regret after their first sexual experience .
Argumentative	 indeed , according to a recent study by the kaiser family foundation , nearlypercent of sexually active teens said they feel pressured to have sex .
Argumentative	 abstinence-only education teaches adolescents that they do not need to rush into sexual relationships by dispelling the notion that sex is something teenagers should be having , and by helping young people explore other ways of being emotionally intimate .
Argumentative	 by leaving out discussions of sex , it reassures teenagers that they do not need to think or worry about sex until they are older , and avoids giving the impression that sex is an important or relevant topic for children .
Argumentative	 sex carries with it a multitude of risks and responsibilities .
Argumentative	 all sex -- even protected -- has the possibility of leading to stis or pregnancy , both of which have huge psychological , emotional , and physical impacts .
Argumentative	 furthermore , sex can create emotional bonds between individuals which are overwhelming and intense .
Argumentative	 young people are simply not emotionally or physically mature enough to take such risks , or accept such responsibilities , and so it is irresponsible to teach anything but abstinence .
Argumentative	 although most previous evidence supporting abstinence-only education failed to meet high scientific standards , a recent study has presented what the washington post calls `` the first clear evidence '' that abstinence-only education really can work .
Argumentative	 the federally funded study found that only about a third of 6th and 7th graders receiving abstinence-only education had sex over the following two years , whereas nearly half of 6th and 7th graders attending other classes became sexually active .
Argumentative	 and , abstinence-only education did not affect condom usage , confirming what the mathematica policy research study cited by the opposition also found !
Argumentative	 .
Argumentative	 this suggests that good abstinence-only programs , this one , for example , did not condemn condoms , implemented at a young age , do have real effects on young people 's sexual activity .
Argumentative	 given that cultural and social attitudes towards sex are so variable , it should be up to the family to decide how to broach this sensitive topic .
Argumentative	 schools are supposed to give students the skills and knowledge they need for employment and/or higher education : sex education is a separate , much more personal , issue .
Argumentative	 telling students to abstain ensures that no one is taught anything more than their parents want , and leaves room for parents to give a more extensive education if they so desire .
Argumentative	 this is especially true since most parents support abstinence education anyway : a zogby international poll of u.s. parents found that% of parents think sex education classes in public schools should place more emphasis on promoting abstinence than on condom and other contraceptive use .
Argumentative	 monogamous sex is much safer than polygamous sex , as it reduces the chance of obtaining and spreading stis .
Argumentative	 furthermore , sex outside of marriage makes it more difficult to develop intimate and trusting relationships .
Argumentative	 random sexual partners who are unsure of each other 's fidelity can not develop the same type of unique and personal relationship that a committed couple can .
Argumentative	 numerous studies have shown that this is the case ; having more partners increases the std risk .
Argumentative	 and , sex before marriage goes against cultural and religious principles .
Argumentative	 abstinence education rightly teaches teenagers that saving sex for marriage is the best way to be healthful and happy .
