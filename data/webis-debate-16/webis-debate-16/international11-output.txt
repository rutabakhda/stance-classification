Non-Argumentative	lesotho is a small country of just over 30,355 km2 (12,727 sq. mi) in size with a population slightly over two million which is landlocked and completely surrounded by south africa, a much bigger countrytimes the size andtimes its population.
Non-Argumentative	 this unusual situation of a country having no access to the sea and being completely surrounded by another country is a result of south africa and lesotho’s colonial history.
Non-Argumentative	basutoland, as the current lesotho was known was threatened from the 1830s by the boers, originally dutch colonists in south africa though no longer under dutch control, who claimed territory in the region.
Non-Argumentative	 the british in charge of cape colony, the colony that would later go on to be south africa, in response made a treaty with basotho recognising them as an ally in 1843.
Non-Argumentative	 while anglo basotho relations were briefly upset by a brief war inthey were soon brought back together after the boers declared the orange free state.
Non-Argumentative	 hostilities broke out inwith the boers besieging thaba bosiu a mountain stronghold that acted as the capital.
Non-Argumentative	 king moshoeshoe appealed to the british who agreed to make the country a british protectorate.
Non-Argumentative	 unlike the rest of south africa therefore the region was brought under british control by diplomatic agreement, not conflict or settlement.
Non-Argumentative	 the territory was ruled from cape colony, but mismanagement resulted in a rebellion in 1880-1 and an appeal for direct rule from london which was accepted in 1884.
Non-Argumentative	  this has meant that lesotho and south africa despite both being controlled by the british were run separately.
Non-Argumentative	 in turn this meant that when south africa became a dominion inand was then granted equality between the dominions and britain inlesotho remained separate and under british, not south african control.
Non-Argumentative	 when independence came inlesotho therefore became an independent country.
Non-Argumentative	key terms:annexation (latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the permanent acquisition and incorporation of some territorial entity into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous).
Non-Argumentative	 usually, it is implied that the territory and population being annexed is the smaller, more peripheral, and weaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size.
Non-Argumentative	 the model of how the annexation is going to take place is not necessarily relevant to the debate but both parts can agree it will happen after a sovereign referendum by the people of lesotho.
Non-Argumentative	 moreover, this debate will settle if the annexation is in favor of both countries and their population.
Non-Argumentative	mosotho is the demonym when referring to a single person from lesotho while when talking about more than one person the word used is basotho.
Argumentative	 for the basotho in a landlocked country the free movement of their people is a right that is in large part dependent on the south african , sa , government rather their own national one .
Argumentative	 its importance is shown by% of border crossings into south africa being from lesotho .
Argumentative	 acknowledging the fact that lesotho is an enclave state surrounded by sa , the ability of people to move freely depends on whether they are allowed to enter sa or not .
Argumentative	 there is corruption at border posts and the number of crossings results in long queues and slow service ;% of border crossers experience problems .
Argumentative	 this is sometimes made even more difficult by sa government actions as before the world cup inwhen border restrictions were tightened making it almost impossible for basotho to leave their country .
Argumentative	 this happened due to the detention of several lesotho nationals after a spate of criminal activities along the border .
Argumentative	 the same situation applies to trade .
Argumentative	 lesotho is dependent on the trade with south africa , even for goods that come from beyond south africa as lesotho has no port of its own most goods will have to be transported through south africa .
Argumentative	 this dependency is rising .
Argumentative	 in, lesotho produced% of the cereals it consumed .
Argumentative	 now it imports% .
Argumentative	 annexation would eliminate these borders boosting trade between the countries , helping to make both richer .
Argumentative	 in the best interest of basotho is to be able to control and be listened to by the entity that is metaphorically and literally feeding them .
Argumentative	 the reason why moshoeshoe , the leader of lesotho , wished to become a british protectorate was because of the boers of the orange free state was trying to take their land .
Argumentative	 in, when the kingdom of lesotho gained its independence from britain , it remained separate from sa as it had been a separate colony .
Argumentative	 lesotho was under direct rule while south africa was a dominion .
Argumentative	 there was no incentive to change at the point of independence because sa was ruled by the apartheid regime .
Argumentative	 lesotho was a strong public opponent of the regime and granted a number of sa refugees ' political asylum .
Argumentative	 the african national congress , the ruling party in sa since, was founded in lesotho .
Argumentative	 moreover , during the struggle against apartheid , the anc 's armed wing organized its guerilla units from the enclave .
Argumentative	 we can firmly say that lesotho vas a very important actor in a post-apartheid sa , but the times have changed .
Argumentative	 the anc is now in power in south africa and sa and lesotho are closer together than ever before .
Argumentative	 with about% of basotho people living below the international poverty line , lesotho needs urgent help both from the economic and social perspective .
Argumentative	 a third of the population is infected with hiv and in urban areas ; about% of the women underhave the virus .
Argumentative	 there is a major lack of funding and corruption in the system is halting any progress .
Argumentative	 the kingdom of lesotho is clearly unable to deal with its issues and should be annexed by sa .
Argumentative	 annexation is the only way in which the sa government is going to care about this enclave territory .
Argumentative	 give basotho citizenship and the right to vote in elections and they will be taken into consideration .
Argumentative	 give sa the power to control and they will assume the responsibility for pulling the basotho out of poverty , giving them a better social system and a country in which they can thrive .
Argumentative	 a simple look at the gdp per capita of each state shows the potential benefit to lesotho and ability of sa to deliver .
Argumentative	 while lesotho is stable at $ 1,700 per capita , sa has a gdp of $ 10,700 per person .
Argumentative	 only by giving them full responsibility of the territory , the sa government is going to step in and make the necessary change .
Argumentative	 bringing south africa and lesotho will benefit sa on the global stage .
Argumentative	 the move would be one to provide aid to a smaller state and provide stability .
Argumentative	 the dire conditions for the basotho people are acknowledged by the un and the africa union .
Argumentative	 firstly , sa , by the annexation of lesotho , will prove good intentions in creating a sustainable sub-saharan africa .
Argumentative	 this will ultimately create a better image and a greater influence in the region if they choose to respond positively to the people 's charter movement in lesotho , a social structure pleading for annexation .
Argumentative	 the movement , driven by trade unions , has collected 30,000 signatures in favor of their goal and is rising in popularity .
Argumentative	 secondly the annexation will provide a boost for the south african development community and south african customs union by demonstrating the willingness of south africa to integrate with poorer neighbours and take on some of the responsibility for them .
