Non-Argumentative	the end of the conflict in libya inwith the overthrow of muammar gaddafi both meant a large number of militants who had been fighting for the libyan dictator fleeing south and a large influx of weaponry into north africa.
Non-Argumentative	 some of this weaponry found its way to the tuareg tribes of northern mali some of whom under the banner of national movement for azawad have fought for the establishment of a tuareg state first upon independence inand more recently in the early 1990s.

Non-Argumentative	 traore promised to “wage a total and relentless war” to reclaim the north of the country.
Non-Argumentative	while the coup had been going on however the malian army had effectively been forced out of the azawad region.
Non-Argumentative	 the mnla therefore declared independence and stopped advancing.
Non-Argumentative	 this however was not the end of conflict in the region as the mnla soon faced a challenge from the more islamist organisations ansar dine and movement for oneness and jihad in west africa (mowja) who wanted much stricter imposition of sharia law.
Non-Argumentative	 after clashes through the summer ofbetween the groups the mnla were forced out of much of the territory they had conquered, no one group has been able to control the whole region.

Non-Argumentative	 this however did not authorise force, and it quickly became apparent that there would be no intervention until the end of 2013.
Non-Argumentative	this however changed when the islamists launched a new offensive capturing the town of konna just 600km from the capital.

Argumentative	 as the former colonial power in much of west africa , including mali , france is the obvious country to turn to for help .
Argumentative	 as a result of this colonial past mali is a member of the french led organisation internationale de la francophonie .
Argumentative	 mali is therefore fully within its sovereign rights to ask for assistance and hollande is right to agree to provide it .
Argumentative	 while it was tuareg separatists who first sparked the insurrection wanting to split mali but now the north has been taken over by islamists and al qaeda in the islamic maghreb presenting a terrorist threat that can not be ignored .
Argumentative	 france 's defence minister jean-yves le drian says `` france 's goal is to lead a relentless struggle against terrorist groups , '' and that `` we have to eradicate this terrorism '' .
Argumentative	 the united states was already clearly worried about mali becoming a center of terrorism having on the 7th december designated the movement for unity and jihad in west africa a terrorist organisation while other groups involved in mali such as al-qa ' ida in the islamic maghreb were already designated as such .

Argumentative	 this intervention is not all about terrorism and a humanitarian desire to end a civil war .
Argumentative	 france does have a stake in the conflict and a reason to deploy military forces .
Argumentative	 there are 6,000 french citizens living in mali who are obviously at risk to a rebel advance ; even without a full scale intervention france would almost certainly have had to deploy forces to protect an evacuation .
Argumentative	 already there are seven french citizens being held hostage in mali and rescuing them is one of the three main objectives for the french intervention .
