Non-Argumentative	“guns, bitches and bling were never part of the four elements of hip hop and never will be.”
Non-Argumentative	 scroobius pip, ‘thou shalt always kill’recurrent themes in discussions on popular culture are the origins and impact of violent imagery and music.
Non-Argumentative	 outlandish, atavistic and brutal content seems to be a naturally occurring part of imagined and narrative culture.
Non-Argumentative	 all societies experience violent conduct, many societies tell stories involving violence, and most societies are likely produce cultural expressions that glamorise violence in some way.
Non-Argumentative	debates over the content and censorship of these forms of media have become increasingly prominent as mass production and communication technologies have enabled books, songs and images to be circulated to ever wider audiences.
Non-Argumentative	during the last two decades, the musical genre known as hip hop has found itself at the forefront of this debate.
Non-Argumentative	 throughout the 1980s a trend towards realist lyrics that reflected the poverty and dispossession of the black communities from which hip hop emerged led to the creation of the “gangsta” rap genre, which fixated on gang violence and drug consumption.
Non-Argumentative	 feuds between commercially successful rappers during the 1990s culminated in shootings and deaths.
Non-Argumentative	 links between hip hop music and violence in inner city areas remain largely unexamined.
Non-Argumentative	 however, hip hop’s apologists point out that gangs and crime are more closely linked to poverty and poor policing than to rap lyrics.
Non-Argumentative	in january this year, a large “urban” music event in south london was disrupted when police officers conducted searches of eighteen performers and a number of young people, looking for concealed weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 such searches are justified by the terms of a risk assessment form- a “696”- that organisers of events in london venues must complete and submit to the police, at the risk of losing their licence.
Non-Argumentative	 the form requires organisers to state the type of music being performed at their event.
Non-Argumentative	 up untilthe form asked organisers to give “demographic” details of an event’s likely audience, including their age and race.
Non-Argumentative	 “proposals of this type often tend to focus on one particular musical genre.
Non-Argumentative	 in the case of the example above, the genre targeted for increased regulation is hip hop.
Non-Argumentative	 many critics, from both inside and outside the hip hop industry have noted its increased focus on themes of gang violence, misogyny and aggressive materialism.
Non-Argumentative	those at the most extreme end of the critical spectrum claim that feuds between hip hop artists demonstrate that it is an art form that trades exclusively in images of cynical brutality, and that by equating thuggish behaviour with a glamorous lifestyle, it encourages other individuals to act in a similar way.
Non-Argumentative	 as noted above, this viewpoint is often used to make the case that hip hop’s fans are likely to engage in criminal behaviour.
Non-Argumentative	the use offorms to shut down urban music events or to justify intensified policing at concerts touches directly on many of the issues contained in principle 1.
Non-Argumentative	 plainly, closing down a musical event based on a tenuous connection between the style of the music that will be performed and the behaviour of the audience is denial of self-expression.
Non-Argumentative	 crucially, however, the disproportionate targeting of hip hop and associated musical forms by the police, taken alongside comments made by high ranking politicians such as david cameron also suggests that it is seen as an inferior form of speech, one that can be freely censored and displaced because it contains no socially valuable content.
Non-Argumentative	the capstone of this misleading approach to the sometimes violent and controversial content of hip hop music is the attitude of public authorities to those who consume and produce it.
Non-Argumentative	 broadcasters of hip hop music have been accused of encouraging knife crime and violent muggings; stickers advising ‘parental guidance’ are regularly attached to hip hop albums.
Non-Argumentative	 at the height of civil unrest in london duringthe prominent historian david starky commented that ‘a particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion,’ and that ‘black and white, boy and girl operate in this language together.
Non-Argumentative	 this language, which is wholly false, which is this jamaican patois that has intruded in england [sic].’
Non-Argumentative	the result of such comments is the demonization of hip hop artists and the infantilisation of their fans.
Non-Argumentative	 both these trends are effective in obstructing free speech.
Non-Argumentative	 once again, they deny the veracity and authenticity of a particular type of free expression under the aegis of protecting the public from criminality.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition, such comments seek to portray the audiences that hip hop attracts as gullible and overly impressionable, adding an additional stereotype to a constellation of already damaging assumptions.
Non-Argumentative	reactionary attempts to shut down music venues and censor hip hop are no replacement for an equitable and even handed assessment of the content of hip hop music.
Non-Argumentative	 violence, even in its glamorised form, will always be part of popular culture, but it is telling that we only begin to find it objectionable when it threatens to bring the problems and realities of life at the margins of society into the mainstream – when fictional glamour reflects too closely on real-life social breakdown.”
Argumentative	- alexander cavellwe should expect fans of an art form that is subjected to public criticism and vilification to leap to its defence .
Argumentative	 some of these aficionados - whether the medium in question is cinema , fine art or pop music - make the case for the value of their favourite mode of expression by overstating its positive effects .
Argumentative	 hip hop has long been the focus of controversies surrounding violent music .
Argumentative	 hip hop is closely associated with low-level criminality , as noted above .
Argumentative	 a number of highly successful hip hop artists have been attacked or killed as a result of feuds within the industry and links between managers , promoters and criminal gangs .
Argumentative	 as the academic john mcwhorter has pointed out in numerous publications , the positive political and social impact of rap music has been massively overstated , as a result of highly charged media coverage of hip hop-linked violence .
Argumentative	 as a result , attempts to address some of the hips hops most objectionable content - lyrics that are misogynist and blankly and uncritically violent - have been condemned as unjust assaults on the right to free expression .
Argumentative	 attacks on negative content in hip hop have been made all the more emotive , because they appear to be an attempt to restrict the speech of members of vulnerable and marginalised communities .
Argumentative	 side proposition agrees with mcwhorter that listening to music that contains violent themes will not , in the absence of other factors , cause individuals to behave in a violent way .
Argumentative	 however , the content of rap , and its strong links with the youngest inhabitants of marginalised , stigmatised urban areas mean that it damages the developmental opportunities of teenagers and young people , and harms others ' perceptions of the communities they live in .
Argumentative	 hip hop trades on its authenticity -- the extent to which it faithfully portrays the lived experience of the inhabitants of deprived inner city areas .
Argumentative	 the greater the veracity of a hip hop track , the greater its popularity and cache among fans .
Argumentative	 musicians have gained public recognition as a result of being directly involved in street crime and gang activities .
Argumentative	 50 cent , a high profile `` gansta '' artist owes his popularity , in part , to a shooting inthat left him withbullet wounds .
Argumentative	 this supposed link to reality is the most dangerous aspect of contemporary hip hop culture .
Argumentative	 unlike the simplistic make-believe of , say , action films , the `` experiences '' related by rappers are also their public personas and become the rationale for their success .
Argumentative	 rap , through materialist boasting and sexualised music videos tells vulnerable young men and women from isolated neighbourhoods that their problems can be solved by adopting similarly nihilistic personas .
Argumentative	 the poverty that affects many of the communities that hip hop artists identify with does more than separate individuals from economic opportunity .
Argumentative	 it also confines the inhabitants of these communities geographically , politically and culturally .
Argumentative	 it prevents young men and women from becoming aware of perspectives on the world and society that run contrary to the violence of main stream rap .
Argumentative	 with television dominated by the gangsta motif , marginalised youngsters are left with little in the way of dissenting voices to convince them that hip hop takes a subjective and commercialised approach to the lives and communities that rappers claim to represent .
Argumentative	 in effect , controversial hip hop is capable of sponsoring violent behaviour , when it is marketed as an accurate portrayal of relationships , values and principles .
Argumentative	 under these circumstances , adolescents , whose own identity is nascent and malleable can easily be misled into emulating the exploits and attitudes of rappers .
Argumentative	 side proposition advocates the control and classification of controversial forms of music , including but not limited to hip hop .
Argumentative	 consistent with principlesand, classification of this type will follow similar schemes applied to movies and videogames .
Argumentative	 assessments of the content of music will be conducted by a politically independent organisation ; musicians and record companies will have the ability to appeal the decisions of this body .
Argumentative	 crucially , the `` ban '' on music containing violent lyrics will take the form of a categorisation scheme .
Argumentative	 content will not be blocked from sale or censored .
Argumentative	 instead , as with the sale of pornographic material in many liberal democratic states , music found to contain especially violent lyrics will be confined to closed off areas in shops , to which only adults , as defined in law , will be admitted .
Argumentative	 its performance on television , radio and in cinemas will be banned .
Argumentative	 live performances of restricted music will be obliged to enforce strict age monitoring policies .
Argumentative	 online distributors of music will be compelled to comply with similar age restrictions and intentionally exposing minors to violent music will be punishable under child protection laws .
Argumentative	 this approach has the advantage of limiting access to violent content only to consumers who are judged , in general , to be mature enough to understand that its `` message '' and the posturing of singers does not equate to permission to engage in deviant behaviour .
Argumentative	 the enforcement of the laws proposed in this article will be fraught , complex and difficult .
Argumentative	 however , the difficulty of administering a law is never a good argument for refusing to enforce it .
Argumentative	 the censorship of the written word ended in england with the lady chatterley and oz obscenity trials , but this liberalisation of publication standards has not prevented the state from prosecuting hate speech when it appears in print .
Argumentative	 it is clear that , although we have more latitude than ever to say or write what we want , no matter how objectionable , standards and taboos continue to exist .
Argumentative	 we can take it that these taboos are especially important and valuable to the running of a stable society , as they have persisted despite the legal and cultural changes that have taken place over the last fifty years .
Argumentative	 hate speech is prosecuted and censored because of its power to intrude into the lives of individuals who have not consented to receive it .
Argumentative	 as pointed out in jeremy waldron 's response to timothy garton ash 's piece on hate speech , hateful comments are not dangerous because they insight gullible individuals to abandon their inhibitions and engage in race riots .
Argumentative	 hate speech is harmful because it recreates - cheaply and in front of a very large audience - an atmosphere in which vulnerable minorities are put in fear of becoming the targets of violence and prejudice .
Argumentative	 additionally , hate speech harms by defaming groups , by propagating lies and half-truths about practices and beliefs , with the objective of socially isolating those groups .
Argumentative	 gangsta rap does all of these things , yet legal responses to the publication of songs containing such lyrics as `` rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome , '' have been timid at best .
Argumentative	 even if we maintain our liberal approach to taboo breaking forms of expression , we can still link hip hop to many of the harms that hate speech produces .
Argumentative	 gangsta rap gives the impression that african-american and latin-american neighbourhoods throughout the usa are violent , lawless places .
Argumentative	 even if the pronouncements of rappers such ascent and nwa are overblown or fictitious they enforce social division by vividly discouraging people from entering or interacting with poor minority communities .
Argumentative	 they damage those communities directly by creating a fear of criminality that serves to limit trust and cohesion among individual community members .
Argumentative	 finally , violent hip hop is also defamatory .
Argumentative	 it propagates an image of minority communities that emphasises violence , poverty and nihilism , whilst loudly proclaiming its authenticity .
Argumentative	 it is completely irrelevant that these images of minority communities are produced by members of those communities .
Argumentative	 it is on this basis , however protracted the process of classification must become , that the content of hip hop songs should be assessed and censored .
Argumentative	 liberal democracies are prepared to go to great lengths to adjudicate on speech that could potentially promote racial or religious hatred .
Argumentative	 the same standards should be applied to hip hop music , because it is capable of producing identical harms .
Argumentative	 the intervention of the state is necessary in order to ensure that aggressive forms of hip hop remain accessible only to adults , especially in neighbourhoods and home environments that are not part of a cohesive , caring community .
Argumentative	 some degree of public control over the content of hip hop will also help to preserve the diversity , accessibility of the genre in the face of commercial dominance by violent forms of rap .
Argumentative	 mainstream success in hip hop has become synonymous with gangsta rap , and with artists who have backgrounds that lend veracity to their lurid verses .
Argumentative	 however , many of these supposedly `` authentic '' experiences consist of little more than exaggeration and invented personas .
Argumentative	 when being interviewed about the controversial content of her son 's single `` fuck tha ' police '' , the mother of rapper ice cube commented that `` i do n't see , him , saying those curse words .
Argumentative	 i see him like an actor . ''
Argumentative	 the existence of pornography attests to the market for forms of media that fulfil base and simplistic human fantasies .
Argumentative	 much the same can be said for the violent and cynical content of rap singles .
Argumentative	 unlike the relationship between cinema and pornography , however , many commentators appear to regard gangsta rap as being synonymous with hip hop -- a position as deceptive as a film critic claiming that all movies are inevitably tied to pornography .
Argumentative	 the significant public profile and poor regulation of hip hop have meant that gangsta rap fans have become the genre 's dominant class of consumer .
Argumentative	 the amount of money that fans are willing to spend on singles , albums , concert tickets and associated branded goods means that labels that cultivate relationships with gangsta rappers have become the gatekeepers of the hip hop genre in general .
Argumentative	 `` conscious '' rappers , who do not glorify violence , along with musicians working in other hip hop genres must work with labels that promote acts containing violent lyrics in order to publish their own music .
Argumentative	 either consciously , or by design , the terrain of contemporary hip hop is hostile to musicians who are not prepared to discuss `` guns , bitches and bling '' in their work .
Argumentative	 this constitutes a significant barrier to rappers ability to communicate novel messages and listeners ' ability to receive them .
Argumentative	 it could be called a market failure -- the pervasive public presence of gangsta rap has effectively denied an audience to other rappers .
Argumentative	 classification has the potential to maximise the freedom and effectiveness of musical expression by hip hop artists who choose not to trade in brutality and misogyny .
Argumentative	 the alternative is to allow hip hop to continue to be dominated by businesses such as death row records , low life records and machete music .
Argumentative	 this will lead to hip hop as a medium becoming inextricably linked with violent lyrics and the dubious businesses practices of gangsta labels ' bosses .
Argumentative	 popular disengagement is much more likely under these circumstances , and will actively deny a voice , and opportunities , to musicians with a different perspective on hip hop .
