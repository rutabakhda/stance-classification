Non-Argumentative	the who reports that “in1.5 billion adults,and older, were overweight with a body mass index (a proxy measurement of body fat based on height and weight) overand that of these 1.5 billion overweight adults, overmillion men and nearlymillion women were obese (bmi > 30).
Non-Argumentative	 overall, more than one in ten of the world’s adult population was reported to be obese.
Non-Argumentative	 once considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are now on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings.
Non-Argumentative	 close tomillion overweight children are living in developing countries andmillion in developed countries.”
Non-Argumentative	the who notes that “overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths.
Non-Argumentative	 at least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition, 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the ischemic heart disease burden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to overweight and obesity.”
Non-Argumentative	since one of the factors that contributes to obesity is the inordinate amount of calories consumed, and given the fact that fats have more than twice as much calories (9 kcal/g) than protein and carbohydrates (4 kcal/g) on a gram basis, could introducing disincentives to fat consumption curb the obesity epidemic?
Non-Argumentative	we would implement a flat tax on food items high (in excess of 20% of the daily requirements) on saturated fats, salt and sugar.
Non-Argumentative	 hungary did that and introduced a flat tax on foods high in fat, sugar and salt in the amount of 10 forint (0.037 eur) on the 1st of september.
Non-Argumentative	 denmark did something similar on the 1st of october, charging 16 dkk (2.15 eur) per kg of saturated fat on domestic and imported food, not including products with saturated fat content fewer than 2.3%.
Non-Argumentative	 there are similar initiatives and proposals in other eu countries as well, as well as overseas in the us.
Argumentative	 the obesity epidemic is taking an enormous toll on global medical costs .
Argumentative	 in the us alone the health care costs attributable to either direct or indirect consequences of obesity have been estimated at $ 147bn .
Argumentative	 put into context , this amounts to roughly% of the health spending in the us .
Argumentative	 the figure might seem excessive , but we need to remember that obesity is linked to typediabetes , several kinds of cancer , coronary artery disease , stroke , congestive heart failure , asthma , chronic back pain and hypertension , to name just a few .
Argumentative	 we also need to realize that many of the diseases on this list are chronic in nature , requiring lifelong pharmacological therapy , which often follows complex and expensive diagnostic procedures , frequent medical specialist consultations , and not infrequent emergency interventions .
Argumentative	 adding to the list is the value of income lost due to decreased productivity , restricted activity , and absenteeism , not to mention the value of future income lost by premature death .
Argumentative	 thus it becomes increasingly clear that due to the substantial cost obesity presents to the society , individual choices that might lead to excessive weight gain , can no longer be considered as solely individual in nature .
Argumentative	 therefore the government is legitimate in its action to introduce a form of a fat tax in order to try to dissuade the population from becoming obese and cover the increasing societal costs the already obese individuals are responsible for .
Argumentative	 a sin tax is a term often used for fees tacked on to popular vices like drinking , gambling and smoking .
Argumentative	 its roots have been traced back to the 16th century vatican , where pope leo x taxed licensed prostitutes .
Argumentative	 more recently , and with greater success , us federal cigarette taxes were shown to have reduced consumption by% for every% increase in the price of cigarettes .
Argumentative	 given the success achieved with uprooting this societal vice , which on a number of counts is similar to the unhealthy food one - immense health costs linked to a choice to consume a product -- we should employ this tried and true strategy to combat the obesity epidemic .
Argumentative	 in fact , a recent study published in the archives of internal medicine followedpeople foryears , tracking food consumption and various biological metrics .
Argumentative	 the report states that `` researchers found that , incremental increases in price of unhealthy foods resulted in incremental decreases in consumption .
Argumentative	 in other words , when junk food cost more , people ate it less . ''
Argumentative	 thus leaning on the successful tradition of existing `` sin '' taxes and research that points out the potential for success of a similar solution in this arena , it should be concluded that a fat tax is an important part of a sensible and effective solution to the obesity epidemic .
Argumentative	 an important reason why people continuously turn to unhealthy , fat , sugar and salt laden food , is the simple fact that it 's often cheaper than a more wholesome meal comprised at least in part of fresh produce .
Argumentative	 a study done at the university of washington found that `` when they compared the prices offoods ... junk foods not only cost less ... but junk food prices are also less likely to rise as a result of inflation . ''
Argumentative	 a similar conclusion was reached by a group of australian researchers , who found that the prices of healthy food have risenper cent above inflation , while the harmful counterpart have actually dropped below inflation -- as much asper cent below .
Argumentative	 noting that obesity is more prevalent in groups of lower socioeconomic status , we find that the price of food is a substantial incentive for consumption .
Argumentative	 thus it is only reasonable to levy a tax against unhealthy , fatty food in order to give healthy food a fighting chance .
