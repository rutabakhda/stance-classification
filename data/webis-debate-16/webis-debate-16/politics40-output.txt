Non-Argumentative	the border between north and south korea is the most heavily fortified in the world.
Non-Argumentative	 officially, the korean war has never ended and the two countries have maintained merely a nervous coexistence since the end of formal hostilities in 1953.
Non-Argumentative	 both sides maintain enormous armies and have mandatory national service.
Non-Argumentative	 it is worth noting that the forms of national service differ enormously; althoughmonths for virtually all men in the south may seem long, it pales into insignificance with theyears in the north.
Non-Argumentative	 typically around the world where there is national servicemonths is standard increasing to two years in some countries.
Non-Argumentative	there has been a discernible generational shift in attitudes towards national service in recent years most obviously demonstrated by the efforts of celebrities and the sons of senior politicians and business leaders to avoid the draft.
Non-Argumentative	 the lengths to which some will go are extraordinary, for example shin dong-hyun, a hip-hop artist better known as mc dong pulled out his own, healthy, teeth in an effort to fail the physical exam.
Non-Argumentative	 more common methods are either the mundane such as drinking too much coffee to increase blood pressure before the medical or the rather more extreme such as changing nationality as was the case with singer yoo seung-jun.
Non-Argumentative	 yoo had emigrated to the us as a child with his family but repeatedly said that he would complete his national service.
Non-Argumentative	 just before he was due to be conscripted in 2002, however, he adopted naturalised american citizenship, making him exempt.
Non-Argumentative	 the public outcry was huge and led the government to ban him from performing on the peninsula.
Non-Argumentative	opinion is divided on the matter with many accepting that celebrities need to be in the public eye constantly otherwise they quickly fade from public memory and that they probably have only until they are about thirty, the cut off point for performing national service, before their career is over.
Non-Argumentative	 others take the attitude that celebrities are simply trying to use their status to avoid doing something that nobody else really wants to do either.
Non-Argumentative	some celebrities such as the singer rain have made a point of performing their duty and it makes for a major news story when they enrol and start basic training.
Non-Argumentative	 in rain’s case one british newspaper went so far as to describe him as “south korea’s modern-day elvis” in reference to elvis presley’s being drafted in 1957.
Non-Argumentative	the fact that sportsmen, like entertainers, face particular challenges in taking a two year break from their careers at an age when they are at the height of their powers is recognised by the south korean government.
Non-Argumentative	 athletes who win an olympic gold, or a similar achievement, are given an exemption from service.
Non-Argumentative	 no such provision applies for entertainers.
Non-Argumentative	 although there was international coverage of rain’s entering the army, it will be interesting to see whether the hundreds of fans who turned up to bid farewell to the k-pop idol on his first day in uniform will be back at the barracks gates when he completes his service in two years’ time.
Argumentative	 the south korean government issues occasional exemptions to athletes who have won an olympic gold medal or achieved a similar feat .
Argumentative	 if we accept that the law ought to be consistent then there is no reason why entertainers should not be proffered the same opportunity .
Argumentative	 both professions tend to favour the young and the requirement that military service needs to be completed before the age of thirty mean that either career would be interrupted just at the point when the individual is likely to be at the height of their skills .
Argumentative	 equally both groups bring prestige for korea as a nation .
Argumentative	 entertainers like jung-ji hoon , rain , have just as much of a following as athletes such as park ji-sung who , along with his team mates on the korean national team was exempted from military service for reaching the semi-finals of the world cup .
Argumentative	 indeed rain predominantly works in korea and has a following throughout the country and the region whereas park has spent most of his career playing for foreign teams .
Argumentative	 the career path of celebrities is unusual in that it accretes over time on the basis of the performers standing in the public mind .
Argumentative	 unlike other professions this does not lend itself to taking two years out of the limelight , especially years when fame is coming to its height .
Argumentative	 the media is notoriously fickle and equally well-known for having a short memory .
Argumentative	 it generally struggles to stay interested in a celebrity if they 're out of the limelight for more than a few weeks .
Argumentative	 it is simply unfeasible that they would remain interested when someone has been out of the spotlight for over two years .
Argumentative	 in effect this means that for a korean musician or actor their career will finish at the age of.
Argumentative	 in other profession it is possible to build a career around national service and employers know that at some point any young man they employ will need to undertake their military service but celebrities simply are n't employed in this way .
Argumentative	 for most professions , getting military service out of the way early in one 's career makes sense .
Argumentative	 nobody would suggest that members of other professions should be expected to interrupt it when they are at the height of their profession .
Argumentative	 in reality for most people this would be when they are in their fifties .
Argumentative	 for professions like acting and music this tends to be the late twenties and early thirties .
Argumentative	 indeed , for pop singers in particular their career is likely to be over when they are.
Argumentative	 in the light of this setting the age limit where it is is uniquely unfair to performers -- just as it is to athletes .
Argumentative	 military service anywhere in the world is considered to be something you undertake before your career , not in the middle of it .
Argumentative	 regulations should reflect reality , in this instance that means allowing performers to get on with their careers .
