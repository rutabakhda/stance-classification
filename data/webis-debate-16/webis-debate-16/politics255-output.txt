Non-Argumentative	most democratic constitutions make some provision for the use of referendums – a public vote which asks the electorate its opinion on a specific proposal to change the law or constitution – to consult citizens on matters considered to be of special importance.
Non-Argumentative	 however, with a few exceptions, most nations use this power extremely infrequently.
Non-Argumentative	supporters of referendums believe that they are a thoroughly good idea; they return power to the hands of the people, increase engagement with politics, and ensure that everyone’s views are represented in the political debate.
Argumentative	 but opponents argue that increased use of referendums would not improve decision-making; on the contrary, they say, putting too many questions before the public in referendums leads to short-term policymaking, turns complex, nuanced debates into simplistic campaigns between slogan-wielding factions, and would just irritate voters who are already fed up of politics.
Argumentative	governments exist to serve the will of the people , not the other way round ; politicians take their instructions from their constituents , or should do .
Argumentative	 but in the modern state this relationship is often inverted .
Argumentative	 by obliging our democratic institutions to take genuine account of public opinion , and returning real political power back to those to whom it rightly belongs -- the people -- we can put the relationship between the individual and the state back on a healthier footing .
Argumentative	 in principle , people should have the right to decide for themselves on matters of importance to their lives .
Argumentative	 in the past , it was impractical to organise frequent referendums due to the difficulty and expense of holding them .
Argumentative	 but with the advent of the internet and mass media , it is now easier than ever to consult the public on issues of concern to them .
Argumentative	 for example , switzerland regularly holds referendums on all sorts of issues in an efficient manner which commands widespread public support .
Argumentative	 people are apathetic about politics because they only get to vote once every few years .
Argumentative	 even then it is not directly for policies but for competing political parties who promise to implement them , but often reverse position when in office .
Argumentative	 they feel that politicians do not listen to them between elections , and disengagement with the political process grows and grows .
Argumentative	 more frequent referendums would stimulate interest in politics because people would actually get a say in decisions .
Argumentative	 for example , evidence from the us shows that states with frequent use of ballot initiatives tend to have higher voter participation in elections .
Argumentative	 many countries have two or three party systems in which there is no spread of opinion between these parties .
Argumentative	 the parties reflect sterile mainstream consensus and do not offer voters what they really want .
Argumentative	 consequently , large sectors of the public find their views unrepresented .
Argumentative	 referendums will remedy this and increase engagement with the political system , because people will know that their views simply can not be ignored .
Argumentative	 for example , a majority in the uk favour the return of the death penalty , but no party among the main three offers this .
Argumentative	 whatever your views on this issues , it seems unfair that there is simply no way for voters ' views to be represented .
Argumentative	 the trend in developed countries tends to be towards greater centralisation , and concentration of power in the hands of a small number of representatives .
Argumentative	 this , in turn , leads to the creation of a separate political class who will in some cases be more concerned with their own influence and enrichment than that of the voters , and makes it possible for wealthy individuals or companies to lobby politicians for laws favourable to their interests .
Argumentative	 increased use of referendums would potentially reduce the influence of lobby groups and corporate donors on the political system .
Argumentative	 particularly on contentious or controversial issues .
Argumentative	 laws passed by public approval in this way will be less open to challenge , with all sides having to accept the will of the electorate .
Argumentative	 this is especially true of minority or coalition governments who may face accusations that they do not have a mandate for certain policies , or situations where minority groups are exercising their right to self-determination .
