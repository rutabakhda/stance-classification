Non-Argumentative	under colonialism, developed and established countries exerted power over less-developed or newly discovered countries.
Non-Argumentative	 it was ‘a practice of domination’, and ‘the subjugation of one people to another’, where a dependant territory was politically and economically controlled by the colonial power.
Non-Argumentative	 many believe that such territories were unashamedly exploited by the colonial powers, both in terms of economic opportunity and the human rights of the native people.
Non-Argumentative	 colonial powers often attempted to disguise motives by labelling their control of colonies as a ‘civilising mission’, to reconcile the cultural and religious beliefs of the native people with western cultural values of ‘civilisation, commerce, and christianity’, in the words of explorer and missionary david livingstone.
Non-Argumentative	 however, colonial belief in their own ‘national, racial, and cultural superiority’ meant that the cultures and values of the colonies were often damaged and abused, and colonial powers had little hesitation in exploiting the economic opportunities of the colonies to their own advantage without giving thought to how the colonies themselves would be affected.
Non-Argumentative	            many groups advocate that developed countries should pay reparations to their former colonies, which tend to be less developed.
Non-Argumentative	 these reparations fall into both an economic and a moral context.
Non-Argumentative	 in terms of economy, some former colonies claim that colonisation, or even the sudden end of colonisation in the case of japan and korea has damaged their ability to form a stable and flourishing economy disruption of trade, or by seriously damaging and abusing the natural resources available within the former colonies.
Non-Argumentative	 kwame nkrumah, the ‘first head of an independent ghana’, labelled colonialism as  ‘the policy by which the .
Non-Argumentative	 colonial power, binds her colonies to herself by political ties with the primary object of promoting her own economic advantages.’
Non-Argumentative	 in this way, it is perceived that the economic interest of the former colony had been ignored unless it also coincided with the interest of the colonial power.
Non-Argumentative	            in a moral context, some groups argue that former colonial powers should pay reparations for wrongdoings during the time of colonisation.
Non-Argumentative	 one crucial example of this is the demand that western colonial powers should pay african former colonies up to $777,000billion in reparations for slavery.
Non-Argumentative	 this is more an argument to repair the historical moral wrongdoing of the colonial power.
Non-Argumentative	 however in both economic and moral cases reparations present a potential to facilitate development in under-developed countries and the developing world more broadly.
Non-Argumentative	 particularly in countries such as african nations which suffer from high rates of poverty and high international debt, financial reparations could pose a solution to serious domestic problems.
Argumentative	 the entire basis for colonisation was predicated on an innate ` understanding ' and judgment of one superior culture and race .
Argumentative	 this ethnocentric approach idolised western traditions while simultaneously undermining the traditions of the countries which were colonised .
Argumentative	 for example , during the colonisation of america , colonists imposed a westernised school system on native american children .
Argumentative	 this denied their right to wear traditional clothing or to speak their native language , and the children were often subject to physical and sexual abuse and forced labour .
Argumentative	 the cause of this was simply ignorance of culture differences on behalf of the colonists , which was idyllically labelled and disguised as ` the white man 's burden ' .
Argumentative	 colonial powers undermined the social and property rights of the colonies , using military force to rule if civilians should rebel against colonisation in countries such as india .
Argumentative	 after indian fighters rebelled against british colonial force in the indian mutiny of 1857-58 , the british struck back with terrible force , and forced the rebels to ` lick up part of the blood ' from the floors of the houses .
Argumentative	 the actions which occurred during colonisation are considered completely inappropriate and undesirable behaviour in a modern world , and in terms of indigenous rights to culture and to property , as well as human rights more generally .
Argumentative	 reparations would be a meaningful act of apology for the wrongs which were committed during the past .
Argumentative	 it is difficult for former colonies to feel as if they can move on and develop a wholly independent identity when their ties to the past , and to their former colonisers , have not been definitively ended .
Argumentative	 for example , while it is important to remember those who suffered under slavery , the overwhelming memory of it overpowers the history of those countries and innately links them back to former colonial powers .
Argumentative	 furthermore , many of the problems now faced by former colonies can be traced back to the actions of colonial-era masters , for example the birth of ethnic tensions between minorities in rwanda and burundi .
Argumentative	 in order to move on from that damaging legacy , and to conclusively prove that such prejudices are always wrong , it is necessary for former colonial powers to show a tangible move towards closing that colonial chapter of their history .
Argumentative	 in this way they can begin to move towards a fresh , equal and co-operative relationship with the developing countries which were their former colonies , without the background of history which currently warps such relationships .
Argumentative	 italy 's payment of reparations to libya allowed libya to ` mend fences with the west ' and to improve international relationships .
Argumentative	 this is a step to recognise developing countries as a nation , rather than an economic opportunity .
Argumentative	 in this way , reparations would be an effective way of demonstrating a global community and spirit .
Argumentative	 in the past , dominating global powers have paid reparations and compensation for historical wrongs .
Argumentative	 for example , germany pays an annual amount of money to israel to recognise wrongs committed against jews during the holocaust , and to recognise the theft of jewish property at this time .
Argumentative	 these reparations have helped israeli infrastructure enormously , providing ` railways and telephones , dock installations and irrigation plants , whole areas of industry and agriculture ' and contributing to israeli economic security .
Argumentative	 japan also paid reparations to korea after world war ii as the koreans were ` deprived of their nation and their identity ' .
Argumentative	 britain has paid compensation to the new zealand maoris for the damage done during colonial times and the seizure of their land , and iraq pays compensation to kuwait for damage done during the invasion and occupation of 1990-91 .
Argumentative	 there is little reason why other nations should not be paid for the grievances caused to them by domination countries .
Argumentative	 there is support for the notion that colonial powers should pay for free universal education in africa ; this would be an entirely appropriate and desirable measure .
Argumentative	 given that much of the motive for colonisation was economic , many former colonies have suffered damage to their natural resources or human resources , which has left them less able to sustain a healthy economy .
Argumentative	 colonists targeted countries with rich natural resources and little ability to defend themselves from invasion and manipulation .
Argumentative	 by this method , they could supply their own markets with the natural resources which they had already exploited at home , and find cheap , or free , human labour for their markets .
Argumentative	 given that powerful countries such as britain and france gained their own economic prosperity through the exploitation of the economic potential of the colonies , it is entirely appropriate and logical that they should pay reparations as compensation .
Argumentative	 in this way , the economic disparity between former colonies and colonists would be equalised .
Argumentative	 even alongside the colonial justifications for providing reparations , there are also many other strong reasons why former colonial powers should grant reparations .
Argumentative	 former colonial powers tend to be economically developed , like america , britain and france .
Argumentative	 the developed world should recognise the dire poverty and social challenges fed by the developing world today .
Argumentative	 giving aid as an act of charity can sometimes be seen as derogatory , and is even rejected by the potential recipients .
Argumentative	 however , reparations allows a transfer of wealth between these countries in a way which is sensitive to the history between them , and which also demonstrates a desire to improve their relationship .
Argumentative	 it allows aid to be given to the developing world in a means which is dignified but not spurious .
