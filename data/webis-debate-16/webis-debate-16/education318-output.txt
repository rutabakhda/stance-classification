Non-Argumentative	the number of students going into higher education after finishing compulsory education has in recent years grown astronomically with many institutions accepting more students from poorer backgrounds than ever before.
Non-Argumentative	 such increases are generally welcomed, both by governments and by their citizens, who hope that both their society and their children will benefit greatly from having a degree, but it naturally costs a great deal of money to fund.
Non-Argumentative	 the question of who should pay for higher education, and how, is an issue which is relevant to every country.
Non-Argumentative	 in some, such as france, germany and britain, up to the early 1990s, the state pays tuition and living costs through grants to individual students, although there may be an element of means testing.
Non-Argumentative	 in others, such as the usa, much of the cost of education is placed upon individual students, who pay for higher education through part-time work, parental contributions and borrowing against their future income.
Non-Argumentative	 the entire uk changed into a system which made all students pay a contribution towards their education through tuition fees, with cheap loans through a government program which are repaid when graduates are in employment; however inscotland, through its devolved parliament, reverted back to a state backed grant system.
Non-Argumentative	 the rate students were expected to pay under the new loan system was capped to ensure students from poorer backgrounds could still get an education if they had the ability.
Non-Argumentative	 the fee cap will have been raised greatly, in england, fromonwards.
Non-Argumentative	 the idea of a graduate tax has been debated in many countries, and was done so in the uk, and particularly in england before the fee cap raise, but has been most notably put into effect in australia where since the early 1990s graduates have paid an income-tax supplement related to their earnings as a means of repaying part of the cost of their university grants.
Non-Argumentative	 the graduate tax proposed in the uk by liberal democrat vince cable inwould work by getting students to pay for their education through taxation once they begin work, the amount paid would depend upon what they are earnings whereas in the current loan system a fixed amount is always paid back as soon as the graduate is working.
Non-Argumentative	 universities would receive funding entirely from the state who will retrieve the money invested in universities back through the tax system.
Argumentative	the proposition proposes that the whole of the uk should switch from a loan based tuition fee system to a graduate tax whereby all students will pay an extra tax over a set period of time, when in full-time employment, alongside income tax to pay for their education.
Argumentative	a graduate tax is the best way to increase access to higher education without massively burdening the government with an open-ended financial commitment .
Argumentative	 it is not a deterrent to the poorer students in the way fees and loans-based schemes are and which simply appear to block access , yet it still delivers sufficient extra capital to fund the increase of students entering university .
Argumentative	 australia 's introduction of a graduate tax has been successful enough to allow university places to grow rapidly following its introduction with participation from both high and low income groups increasing by approximately one third .
Argumentative	 , chapman , b..
Argumentative	 therefore , a graduate tax removes the expensive barriers to entry that had previously kept out low-income groups , whilst not discouraging the high-income groups from tertiary education .
Argumentative	 a graduate tax would potentially give universities more than they get from traditional funding , as a contribution would depend directly on a person 's salary rather than just being a flat rate fare for services rendered over a short time .
Argumentative	 for example a person earning # 40,000 would pay about #per month .
Argumentative	 , shepard , j., that overyears could amount to # 30,000 , more than enough to cover the costs of a university education in a way which is manageable .
Argumentative	 admittedly that sum is based on a person rising like a rocket but it still hints at the possibilities of the tax and how it could bring in more money than simply universities rising their fees .
Argumentative	 secondly , it would change as a person 's salary rises or falls over a twenty year period , being more sustainable and increasing the chance of the costs being recovered .
Argumentative	 thirdly , rather than giving a person a required fee to pay it would be giving a person a chance to pay over a set time period , reducing the financial impact of the bill .
Argumentative	 a graduate tax would be fairer for everyone in society .
Argumentative	 graduates earn considerably more than non-graduates , on average over # 100,000 more in a lifetime , channelnews ,.
Argumentative	 , , experience lower rates of unemployment and greater job security , they therefore benefit hugely from higher education .
Argumentative	 they should therefore be expected to pay for the privilege of having an education which has put them in that position rather than having the rest of society fund there degrees , going to university should be an honor and not a privilege .
Argumentative	 while having a degree is useful it is not necessary for getting on with life , if someone wants to go to university they should have that opportunity regardless of their background but they should be expected to contribute to that education which is why the graduate tax works as students of all social classes can join university , not be loaded with debt and can contribute fiscally when viable .
