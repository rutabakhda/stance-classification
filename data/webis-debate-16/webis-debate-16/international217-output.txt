Non-Argumentative	a fundamental point within acemoglu and robinson’s (2013) why nations fail is that the prosperity of a nation relies upon an effective power structure.

Non-Argumentative	the mo ibrahim prize was first established in 2007, and the prize represents a celebration of excellent african leadership.
Non-Argumentative	 the prize is awarded to a former head of state, or government, for their positive work in enabling the prosperity of their nation, tackling poverty, and sustaining an equitable path of development.
Non-Argumentative	 the former head of state or government has to have left office within the last three years, have been democratically elected and completed their term, and shown ‘exceptional’ leadership.

Non-Argumentative	 previous winners include president nelson mandela (honorary) and joaquim chassano (2007); president festus mogae (2008), and president pedro pires (2011) (mo ibrahim foundation, 2013).
Non-Argumentative	 however, with the prize criteria regularly not being fulfilled, since its establishment inthe prize has remained unclaimed foryears - 2009, 2012, and recently 2013.
Non-Argumentative	 to what extent can the denial of the prize be justified?
Argumentative	 does it act to incentivise african leaders to follow good governance?
Argumentative	the past few years have seen african governments , and heads of state , reluctant to leave office ; driving political coups ; and leading violent crimes against humanity .
Argumentative	 mugabe , kabila , and kenyatta are but a few articulating the years of sustained bad governance .
Argumentative	 the prize is only awarded when credit is due - if leaders have made a significant positive impact this will be recognised and rewarded .
Argumentative	 the prize is therefore for absolute gains in governance , not relative to other countries .
Argumentative	 as the prize is not always awarded it avoids the pitfall that distributing a financial prize where no change has been made to political institutions would reinforce a system .
Argumentative	 the state would continue to function on undemocratic governance , and the reward would become a new example of dead money .
Argumentative	 instead it encourages improved control over aid and money transferred to african states , it shows that rewards are given based on merit .
Argumentative	 the mo ibrahim prize therefore encourages the good institutions that are necessary for prosperity , acemoglu and robinson  .
Argumentative	 previous winners - such as nelson mandela and pedro pires - made significant changes to their nation-states , ending apartheid and promoting social development .
Argumentative	 the former leaders provided equality and a functioning democracy to their people .
Argumentative	 such needs to be the aim of leaders today .
Argumentative	 providing a prize to the highest achievers provides an example .
Argumentative	 it highlights leaders from even small countries -- such as cape verde 's pires -- that can serve as role models for africa 's leaders .
Argumentative	 without the prize the most likely role models would simply be those of the biggest states who are highest profile .
Argumentative	 mo ibrahim  has stated the prize is for `` excellence , it 's not a pension '' .
Argumentative	 this is why it is not always awarded .
Argumentative	 the prize is only be awarded when high-standards of good governance are replicated , and maintained , by leaders .
Argumentative	 focusing on the top of government encourages a top down implementation of good government .
Argumentative	 when the leader acts others will follow ; a comparatively small amount of money can therefore make a big difference .
Argumentative	 the prize is helping citizens to be aware of good governance , and bad , occurring within their state .
Argumentative	 by granting the prize citizens are shown what leaders have done right ; and the publication of the index - the ibrahim index of african governance , iiag , - shows where improvement may be required .
Argumentative	 the prize is forcing transparency between governments and society .
Argumentative	 information on how states are doing means citizens can take action , and demand change where change is needed .
Argumentative	 the prize is calling for african citizens to get the leadership they deserved , desired , and have a right to .
Argumentative	 by maintaining strict standards on when , and to whom , the reward is provided gives a realistic picture of governance in africa .
Argumentative	 it showcases the continued need for good governance ; and also does n't give citizens and the international community a false illusion that governance is good in africa when it is not .
