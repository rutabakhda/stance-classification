Non-Argumentative	the term curriculum refers to the programme of study in various academic subjects (e.g maths, english, history, science, spanish) followed by students at various levels of education.
Non-Argumentative	 the school or college's teaching staff are employed to teach this curriculum, and students are periodically assessed (e.g. by exams and term papers) in their progress in each curriculum subject.
Non-Argumentative	 as they grow older, students' achievements in their curriculum subjects are seen as important in helping them get into a good university or college, and to find a good job when they leave education.
Non-Argumentative	 depending on which country you are in, schools and colleges may also be held accountable for their students' results in the curriculum subjects.
Non-Argumentative	the academic curriculum has never been all that schools and colleges offer to their students.
Non-Argumentative	 often a range of other classes, clubs and activities is available to students, sometimes in lessons but more often in the lunch break or after school.
Non-Argumentative	 these are referred to as extra-curricular activities and they are mostly voluntary for students.
Non-Argumentative	 examples would include sports, musical activities, debate, model united nations, community service, religious study groups, charitable fundraising, young enterprise projects, military cadet activities, drama, science clubs, and hobbies such as gardening, crafts, cookery and dance.
Non-Argumentative	 because they are not examined in the same way that the academic curriculum is, and because most of them take place outside lessons, such activities have less status in education than the main curriculum.
Non-Argumentative	 however, they are often held to be very important to the wider education of young men and women.
Argumentative	 this topic examines whether the extra-curriculum should be given more importance in schools and collegesthe normal curriculum can only go so far as to teach and educate students about academic theories .
Argumentative	 but students whose only experience of school or college is one of rigid academic study may not be able to apply what they have learned in practice .1 extra curricular activities encourage a diverse range of skills and methods of learning that encompass the diverse needs of students .
Argumentative	 for example , schemes such as young enterprise allow students to experience of practical business skills and valuable communication and team work skills .
Argumentative	 if the extra-curriculum was given an equal footing in student life there will be an improvement in the student ability to grasp things as a whole , because students will have received a more rounded education .
Argumentative	 many children have talents in all sorts of different areas , and it is wrong to force them to specialise too early .
Argumentative	 ` every child and young person is entitled to experience a broad general education 'even if a student does not aim to be a professional musician they should still have opportunity to learn an instrument .
Argumentative	 a career is not the only , or most the important , part of an adult 's life -- school needs to make sure they have interests and skills that will help them in their family and leisure lives too .
Argumentative	 through equal balancing of academic and extra-curriculum , however , the students have the chance to exercise their rights , learn a diverse range of skills and the opportunity to be multi-talented .
Argumentative	 most extra-curricular activities are physically active , getting the student out from behind their desk and making them try new things .
Argumentative	 physical activity is extremely important for general health whilst ensuring that students are exposed to practical tasks , not just what is taught in class .1 sports clubs and teams give students the opportunity to do physical exercise in an enjoyable environment whilst activities such as the duke of edinburgh award teach skills such as map reading and organisation of a group .
Argumentative	 the outcome of giving the extra-curriculum the same status as the curriculum will therefore be well balanced individuals .
Argumentative	 schools have a pastoral duty to consider the well-being of their pupils which includes physical health and practical abilities .
Argumentative	 boosting the place of the extra-curriculum in schools is one way of addressing a weakness in modern society , a lack of civil strength and community .
Argumentative	 activities offered in schools are vital in providing opportunities to learn the diverse skills help to equip young people with the civic spirit , initiative and organising skills to set up their own clubs , teams and activity groups when they leave education .
Argumentative	 an article in the guardian argues that ` the riots suggest that the education system must concern itself with a lot more than simple exam results ' .1 a successful extra-curriculum often depends on building links between the school and the wider community , bringing local enthusiasts in to work with students , and sending students out to work on community projects , help in primary schools , perform for local audiences , etc, thus , extra-curricular activities have wider social implications than the individual schools and pupils .
