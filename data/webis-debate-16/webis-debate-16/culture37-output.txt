Non-Argumentative	aroundgerman inventor johannes gutenberg invented one of the most important and influential inventions of the second millennium, the printing press, and it was from the advent of this technology that the newspaper was born.
Non-Argumentative	 newspapers went from strength to strength and they became an important part of democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 george washington instated that: “for my part i entertain a high idea of the utility of periodical publications; insomuch as i could heartily desire, copies of ... magazines, as well as common gazettes, might be spread through every city, town, and village in the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 i consider such vehicles of knowledge more happily calculated than any other to preserve the liberty, stimulate the industry, and ameliorate the morals of a free and enlightened people.”
Non-Argumentative	 1 in the 21st century, however, with the availability of other forms of media, such as tv and the internet, the once highly important newspaper entered a state of significant and rapid decline in many places across the world with readerships entering a seemingly never-ending downward spiral.
Non-Argumentative	 this has left many commentators to suggest that newspapers are a thing of the past, phillip meyer in the vanishing newspaper suggests, by extrapolation of current trends, that by the first quarter ofthe newspaper industry in the us will be completely extinct.
Non-Argumentative	 others suggest, however, that this is overstating the decline of newspapers, it could be suggested that there will always be a demand for printed word despite the current decline, for example in the uk on the 26th octoberthe first daily newspaper to be launched foryears hit the shelves and as of aprilthe “i” newspaper had a regular readership of over 160,000 2 suggesting that perhaps that some demand still exists.
Non-Argumentative	 what is most certainly true of newspapers today is that they are, in the developed world at least, losing their readerships, however, does this necessarily mean that there is no longer a place for them in the modern media landscape, are newspapers dead or are the rumors of their death greatly exaggerated?
Argumentative	 with the development of digital video recorders , dvrs , and more generally the internet people have come to no longer simply consume media in a linear fashion , they take a more fragmented approach .
Argumentative	 in news consumption people no longer want to simply have one newspaper with a vast array of topics inside .
Argumentative	 they want to pick and choose which stories and columns they consume , people now prefer to pull the content they want rather than have it pushed on them .
Argumentative	 in a digital world the news consumer can become their own editor and no longer need to rely entirely on old hierarchical structures .
Argumentative	 in an interconnected global world whereby technology allows us within seconds to communicate across the globe in a variety of forms the newspaper medium becomes obsolete .
Argumentative	 in the time it takes to write , edit , print and distribute a newspaper the events being covered may very well have changed , when we have the technology to overcome this problem it seems unlikely that newspapers will continue to exist because who wants to read old news ?
Argumentative	 an example of newspapers not being able to adapt to changing events can be seen with the killing of osama bin laden on 2nd may, the story broke too late for the morning newspapers in the uk to be able to change their pages to include the story , it was then subsequently reported a day late on the 3rd may .
Argumentative	 newspapers have no place in the modern media landscape as they are not environmentally friendly , they are a waste of paper when there are many other my efficient ways in which news can be disseminated .
Argumentative	 for example a single annual subscription to the new york times roughly generates 520lb of waste which equates to approximately 4.25 trees being cut down per reader per year, when you take into account all the other publications that printed throughout the world this equates to a lot of wastage of increasingly scarce natural resources which could be avoided .
Argumentative	 using digital tools to distribute news is more efficient as you only use resources when the content is actually required rather than the print media method in which the product is printed when it may not be necessarily purchased and consumed .
Argumentative	 in the internet age , newspapers are no longer financially profitable businesses .
Argumentative	 they are struggling to encourage investment and to survive in the long-term .
Argumentative	 revenue is falling across the three main streams available to newspapers : sales , advertising and subscriptions .
Argumentative	 sales and subscriptions are dropping as consumers move to the internet for information , often the website of the newspaper themselves !
Argumentative	 , 1 advertising is not as profitable either , as increasingly advertisers look to pop-up systems on websites and buying space on search engines .
Argumentative	 many newspapers have resorted to cutting costs , firing staff , reducing the length of the paper , and raising prices .
Argumentative	 yet it does not seem likely that people will be willing to pay more for less .
