Argumentative	 by prosecuting perpetrators , justice creates a deterrent .
Argumentative	 the deterrent effect , as accepted in criminal law generally , is likely to make the peace more long standing and stable in the future -- it will make those minded to perform atrocities think again .
Argumentative	 if those who committed atrocities ` get away with it ' they will be much more likely to plunge the country back into violence .
Argumentative	 the career of laurent nkunda is a good example of this ; he fought in the tutsi group that took control of rwanda inending the genocide and then was a rebel commander in both congolese civil wars in which he was accused of atrocities before launching his own rebellion , only now afteryears as an army commander is he under arrest .

Argumentative	 this not only encouraged a belief that germany could win in another war but also as the accusation was levelled particularly at socialists and jews helped pave the way for the holocaust .
