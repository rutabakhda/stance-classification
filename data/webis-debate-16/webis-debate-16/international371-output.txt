Non-Argumentative	imperialism casts a long shadow over africa, and much of that shadow is a result of the way the imperial powers drew their borders.
Non-Argumentative	 lord salisbury famously put it "we have been engaged in drawing lines upon maps where no white man’s feet have ever trod; we have been giving away mountains and rivers and lakes to each other, only hindered by the small impediment that we never knew exactly where the mountains and rivers and lakes were."
Non-Argumentative	 but when the borders had been drawn and agreed they were set; administrators who suggested they should be tweaked to reflect ethnic groupings were rebuffed.
Non-Argumentative	colonial powers could live with artificial borders; they were not too concerned with the comings and goings of the natives and could make sure that no conflict would break out over odd borders that frankly they did not care about.
Non-Argumentative	 with decolonisation however artificial borders became much more of an issue.
Non-Argumentative	 london or paris might not have been concerned about african borders but yaoundé and rabat were much more likely to be.
Non-Argumentative	 borders were not only much closer and have a greater impact on policy but ensuring sovereignty right up to the border was a way of creating a nation state.
Non-Argumentative	 thus the new leaders were no more inclined to rethink borders than the old.
Non-Argumentative	 the organisation of african unity (oau) charter highlights a determination “to safeguard… sovereignty and territorial integrity” in the preamble, the purposes, and the principles of the oau.
Non-Argumentative	 as a result this issue is still an immense problem; the border between togo and ghana alone divides the dagomba, akposso, konkomba and ewe peoples.
Non-Argumentative	ratner suggests that new states should only preserve the status quo on borders until the states can resolve the competing claims so colonial era borders should not be taken as immutable.
Non-Argumentative	 the assumption then is that there will be changes to the administrative legacy at some point.
Non-Argumentative	 but this does not address borders that are already half a century old.
Non-Argumentative	 redefining african borders would seem to imply just redrawing existing borders but in practice doing so while not allowing an opportunity for the creation of new states would be difficult.
Non-Argumentative	 the proposal therefore would be that current borders are not set; there should be commissions that find the ethnic borders between states and those ethnicities should be able to decide which state they join.
Non-Argumentative	 where there are strong independence movements this would also be a chance to create new states but the default assumption should be that ethnic groups want to remain in their current state unless this is clearly disputed so as to not mean a chaotic breakup of africa as we know it.
Argumentative	 imperialism and colonisation is one of the great wrongs of history where much of the globe was carved up without any reference to the facts on the ground .
Argumentative	 when the west drew borders peoples were split , and kingdoms and cultures carved up .
Argumentative	 independence may have ended some of the worst aspects of imperialism but it exacerbated the problem of borders .
Argumentative	 africa has since seen the problems that this has created and should realise the need to break from the colonial legacy .
Argumentative	 in africa borders are artificial often running through ethnic groupings without consideration for culture or even local geography with the exception of water courses .
Argumentative	 altering these borders to reflect ethnicities and culture would help states to create their own national identity as their identities would not be split .
Argumentative	 having the whole of an ethnicity within one state will help prevent misappropriation of culture and history by another state .
Argumentative	 redrawing borders could help resolve conflict in africa .
Argumentative	 michalopoulos and papaioannou find `` civil conflict intensity , as reflected in war casualties and duration , is approximately% higher in areas where partitioned ethnicities reside . ''
Argumentative	 conflict duration is 18.5 % higher .
Argumentative	 they identify seven different ways in which artificial borders lead to , or intensify conflict ; 1 , partitioning ethnicities creates irredentist demands 2 , partitioning makes an independence movement more likely 3 , when borders are not marked the ethnic group has a reason to attempt to change the border 4 , patronage politics leads to discrimination against minorities 5 , splitting ethnicities encourages smuggling and criminalisation 6 , splitting resources that were previously part of an ethnic group 's homeland will leave the ethnic group trying to engineer the resources return 7 , partitioning reduces development so increases inequality with and resentment towards the center of the state .
Argumentative	 getting rid of all of these reasons for conflict would help make africa more peaceful in the long run .
Argumentative	 using data from satellites measuring luminosity michalopoulos and papaioannou find that border areas with partitioned ethnic groups are up to% less developed than those towards the centre of countries so are not artificially split .
Argumentative	 ethnicity is significant for trade .
Argumentative	 for example between niger and nigeria prices of millet increase at the border by 23.2 % when it is also the border between ethnicities but only 9.3 % when the same ethnicity is on both sides of the border for cowpea the figures are 20.2 % and 14.4 % .
Argumentative	 moreover internally where there is an ethnic border between markets there is a similar increase of% for millet and% for cowpea .
Argumentative	 ethnicity may also affect the ability to gain credit from other traders .
Argumentative	 it therefore makes sense economically to have borders at ethnic boundaries due to the natural trading relations within an ethnic group .
Argumentative	 splitting an ethnic group creates unnecessary hardship by making it more difficult to trade .
Argumentative	 a redrawing of borders would allow for democratic participation in the building of new african states .
Argumentative	 there would have to be plebiscites in local areas to determine where borders should run and extensive consultation so that the borders are drawn based on the wishes of the people this time .
Argumentative	 the opposite of what happens at the moment .
Argumentative	 for example much of the bakassi homeland was ceded by nigeria to cameroon as a result of an international court of justice ruling on the colonial border and many people are asking nigeria to resettle them as they do n't share cameroon 's culture .
Argumentative	 clearly the people would surely much prefer to have their destiny in their own hands than letting the borders be settled by an international court pouring over 19th century maps .
