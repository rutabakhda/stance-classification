Non-Argumentative	terrorism, according to wikipedia, is, broadly speaking, “those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for a religious, political or ideological goal, and deliberately target or disregard the safety of civilians or non-combatants”.
Non-Argumentative	 there is some debate as to whether or not we can distinguish between terrorism and freedom fighters but for the purposes of this debate when we refer to terrorists we refer to groups such as al-qaeda, al-shabaab, hamas, hezbollah, the irish republican army, taliban and other such organisations that are generally recognised as terrorist.
Non-Argumentative	 compensation refers to a monetary payment given to the individual who are wither direct victims of a terrorist attacks or else to family members who suffer as a result of the death of a loved one.
Non-Argumentative	 it would be wise as a proposition to begin the debate by stipulating that this would only be possible where it is clear who the perpetrators were and what their nationality was.
Non-Argumentative	there are two possible scenarios.
Non-Argumentative	 either the terrorists have committed the atrocities in their own nation in which case there is less debate as we are far more inclined to believe that governments have certain duties towards their own citizens, or terrorists commit atrocities in countries other than their own, in which case there is a greater burden on the proposition to show why the state ought to be held responsible.
Non-Argumentative	so the questions to be answered in this debate are: are we justified in holding a state responsible for terrorist acts committed by its citizens?
Non-Argumentative	 what will the consequences of this policy be?
Non-Argumentative	the un suggests: the more viable alternative [to the motion under debate] is to create an international fund for victims of terrorism.
Non-Argumentative	 terrorism is a global phenomenon and we need a global solution to this menace so that the damage is mitigated to a certain extent.
Non-Argumentative	 this view of setting up an international fund was even backed by the un since the government can’t pay every time.
Non-Argumentative	 this fund was originally suggested to be providing financial support rather than compensation but could be easily adapted will serve better is a more viable alternative instead of calling on the government to pay up for acts of terror.
Non-Argumentative	this is one possible line that an opposition can take.
Non-Argumentative	 it is also possible for the opposition to argue that the government of the victims should pay the compensation or that there should be no compensation at all.
Non-Argumentative	 i will run the opposition line that the victim government should be paying compensation.
Argumentative	 the state must pay compensation for the terrorist attacks because they are indirectly responsible for them .
Argumentative	 it is the state 's duty to ensure that its citizens act within the law by providing deterrents , education and by preventing crimes through the use of intelligence .
Argumentative	 even if the terrorist atrocities do not take place within the state , they were most probably planned within the state or initiated by someone who lives in the state .
Argumentative	 this means that it was within the state 's power to have prevented the attack from taking place .
Argumentative	 just as we would expect a state to investigate and track down a drug syndicate , we expect the state to track down terrorist organisations and prevent their activities .
Argumentative	 in many cases , states are not only responsible in this manner but also in a more direct manner .
Argumentative	 this may involve a paramilitary group -- a group that acts like a military but whose affiliation with the state or whose existence is kept secret .
Argumentative	 it may involve the state supplying the terrorist group with weaponry , money or intelligence .
Argumentative	 in these cases the state should clearly be held liable for the atrocities committed .
Argumentative	 for example , iran supports hamas financially and also claims that it shares identical views on palestine with hamas .
Argumentative	 iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to keep supporting hamas until the collapse of israel .
Argumentative	 syrian president bashar assad as another example provides both funds and weaponry for hezbollah .
Argumentative	 making the state pay for the wrongs of its citizens is therefore not only just but sends the message that the international community recognises the states involvement and duty in this regard .
Argumentative	 this means that the state becomes responsible in the sense that it takes the blame .
Argumentative	 if states are expected to pay compensation in this way then they are incentivised to take action against terrorist organisations to prevent incurring this massive cost .
Argumentative	 they are more likely to put resources into investigating leads and to take a hard stance on terrorist activity .
Argumentative	 this will decrease the prevalence of terrorism or at least make more intelligence available .
Argumentative	 why would the expectations that a country should pay compensation be a strong enough motive to force nations to pay up ?
Argumentative	 if it becomes commonplace and therefore expected , nations who do not pay compensation will be viewed as supporting terrorism or perhaps be suspected of being in cahoots with the terrorists .
Argumentative	 this would be very harmful to the nation .
Argumentative	 for example , in the case of the lockerbie bombing , suspicion of libya 's involvement lead to sanctions and poor international relations for many years .
Argumentative	 libya ultimately felt it was better to pay $ 2.7 billion , $ 10million per person killed , than continue to face un sanctions .
Argumentative	 compensation can prevent more violence because the victims are less likely to seek revenge if they feel that a , they have been recognised as victims b , the perpetrators , at least someone representing the perpetrators , has suffered financially and so some justice has been done c , they are more satisfied with the outcome of events because they have received money .
Argumentative	 this is less important in scenarios such as the london train bombings and 9/11 where there is little chance of victims retaliating but it is important in conflicts that have revenge as a common theme .
Argumentative	 for example , the israel-palestine conflict involves a lot of retaliation resembling age-old family feuds .
Argumentative	 feuds are often prevented through the payment of blood money , in saudi arabia blood money rates are 100,000 riyals to compensate for the death of a muslim man .
Argumentative	 perhaps we could use similar compensation to prevent some of this retaliation by compensating victims in the case of terrorism victims .
Argumentative	 often when a terrorist attack occurs the victims feel anger not only towards the individual perpetrators or the terrorist organisation but towards the entire national , political , cultural or religious group they belong to .
Argumentative	 an example of this is the flood of anti-muslim , anti-arab sentiment that arose after the 9/11 attacks .
Argumentative	 this has a lot of negative consequences because it means that perfectly innocent people will suffer hate crimes and ostracization which in turns is likely to turn those people against the victims of the terrorist attack .
Argumentative	 this kind of disharmony lays the foundation for poor international relations , discrimination and particularly make it difficult for integration to occur such a when a muslim family moves to the us .
Argumentative	 when the state pays compensation for the terrorist attacks they are making a statement that they recognise terrorism to be wrong .
Argumentative	 when this happens victims begin to distinguish from the terrorist organisation and the rest of the people in their cultural or national group .
Argumentative	 this allows for greater cultural reconciliation .
Argumentative	 the times when reparations tend to be suggested are when there is a wound of sorts between two groups of people that needs to be healed in order for there to be closure and reconciliation .
Argumentative	 an example of this is after the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa when compensation was given to victims of apartheid .
Argumentative	 we would argue that terrorist attacks fit perfectly into this frame because terrorist attacks tend to be committed by one group with a particular political , religious or national identity against another group with a different political , religious or national identity .
Argumentative	 compensation plays a role in reconciling these two groups .
Argumentative	 this compensation is not purely to provide the victims with things they have lost e.g. if they have lost the breadwinner of their family money will help them and if their home was burnt down again money will help .
Argumentative	 compensation from one 's own government can fulfil this need .
Argumentative	 but compensation from another government acts not only to fill financial needs but to provide reconciliation and closure .
