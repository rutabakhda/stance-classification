Non-Argumentative	for the summer of 2013, the question of security versus privacy was debated and discussed all around the world, due to the leaks about intelligence agencies surveillance systems provided by edward snowden to newspapers such as the guardian.
Non-Argumentative	 snowden was a nsa whistleblower who revealed that the national security agency was conducting a massive campaign through which it was using telephones, the internet and other technologies to engage in spying, monitoring and tracking the actions of foreigners, and through other intelligence agencies such as gchq u.s. citizens, often without any warrant and often oversight systems were seen to be failing or ignored.
Non-Argumentative	 this showed the world that the intelligence services have the capability of secretly monitoring a large part of the population without anyone having a single clue.
Non-Argumentative	 in this debate, many proponents argue that the right to privacy is inalienable and that we must protect ourselves from an otherwise abusive government, while on the other side it is claimed that it is security which should be prioritized and that this kind of measure will lead to lives being saved and criminals behind bars.
Non-Argumentative	 at the moment, in most of western states, the police must have a warrant in order to track someone’s phone, car or internet action, but this may not or may not be the case for other surveillance as carried out by intelligence agencies.
Argumentative	 one of the most important pillars on which every single western liberal democracy has been founded is freedom .
Argumentative	 allowing the government to be able to track and monitor individuals through mobile or internet connections is against everything we , as a western society , stand for .
Argumentative	 first of all , it is undisputable that liberty and freedom are indispensable to our society .
Argumentative	 every single individual should and must be the master of his own life , he should have the capacity of controlling how much the government or other individuals know about him , the right to private life being the main argument in this dispute .
Argumentative	 secondly , it is clear that phone and internet tracking potentially allow the government to know almost everything about you .
Argumentative	 most phones have a gps incorporated and a lot can be deduced about ones habits by the photos or updates on his social network profile .
Argumentative	 one who knows all of another 's travels , can deduce whether he is a weekly church goer , a heavy drinker , a regular at the gym , an unfaithful husband , an outpatient receiving medical treatment , an associate of particular individuals or political groups , basically about every activity you have in your life .
Argumentative	 remember this data is extremely precise , as your cell phone sends your location back to cell phone towers every seven seconds -- whether you are using your phone or not -- potentially giving the authorities a virtual map of where you are 24/7 .
Argumentative	 finally , we , as individuals , created this artificial structure , i.e the state , to protect our human rights , but also to protect us from each other .
Argumentative	 we admitted that some rights can be taken away if there is serious concern about the security of other people .
Argumentative	 therefore , it is absolutely normal to allow the government to track and follow certain individuals who are believed to have taken part in criminal activities , but there is no ground on which you can violate the right to privacy of a law-abiding citizen , especially if we are talking about such an intrusive policy .
Argumentative	 if we did so , it would come as a direct contradiction with the very purpose the state was created .
Argumentative	 in the light of the recent nsa events  , we must try and see past this curtain of fog the government has put in front of us , trying to make us believe that everything it does , it does for our own good and that in this process the law is being respected to the letter .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , if the necessary system of checks-and-balances between the government and the masses or judicial courts is lacking , it will always find ways to abuse its powers and violate our rights .
Argumentative	 even with the warrant currently being mandatory when trying to tap one 's phone , we see that justice department 's warrantless spying increasedpercent in decade  .
Argumentative	 if the government is currently invading our lives when we have specific laws banning it from doing so , why should we believe that this phenomenon wo n't escalate if we scrap those laws ?
Argumentative	 the government 's biggest limitation when actively trying to spy or follow a large group of people was technological ; it was difficult - if not impossible - to follow a lot of people for days at a time .
Argumentative	 but with surveillance tools it 's becoming cheaper and easier , as is proven by the astounding 1.3 million demands for user cell phone data in the last year `` seeking text messages , caller locations and other information '' ,.
Argumentative	 , without the resource limitations that used to discourage the government from tracking you without good reason , the limits on when and how geolocation data can be accessed are unclear .
Argumentative	 a police department , for example , might not have the resources to follow everyone who lives within a city block for a month , but without clear rules for electronic tracking there is nothing to stop it from requesting every resident 's cell phone location history .
Argumentative	 considering these facts , it is clear that , as we live in a time when it would be extremely easy for the government to engage in mass surveillance of the population , we must enforce and harden the current laws for our own protection , rather than abandoning then for good .
Argumentative	 no matter what , george orwell 's books should not be perceived as a model for shaping our society .
Argumentative	 at the end of the day , without any oversight , it would be extremely easy for the government to abuse this power given to it by electronic surveillance tools , without us ever knowing it .
Argumentative	 this system is the only thing left that prevents government agencies to violate our rights .
Argumentative	 in a world where state agencies would have the possibility of tracking everyone 's moves without any person knowing it , we would reach a point in which the population lose their trust in their elected officials .
Argumentative	 the consequences could then be very damaging to democracy .
Argumentative	 this phenomenon took place right after the nsa leaks , as the confidence in the us government was near record 's low .
Argumentative	  first of all , the population would know that the government is spying and tracking their moves , but they would n't know how much .
Argumentative	 this general lack of information on this matter will create a lot of scepticism relating this process , and inevitably the population will reach the conclusion that the government is conducting massive phone tapping and spying campaigns as no one is checking on them .
Argumentative	 despite potential official document trying to give certain facts regarding this , due to the previous incidents when the state has been releasing little or misleading information , these will have little influence over the population .
Argumentative	 as a result , trust in the state will suffer a massive blow .
Argumentative	 this is extremely problematic , as you want and need the general population to trust and listen to what the government , and more particularly law enforcement agencies , say in a lot of instances .
Argumentative	 when promoting non-discrimination , gender equality or increased social welfare contributions for the poor , you need the population to see the state as someone who is on the same side with them and someone who they can trust .
Argumentative	 unfortunately , the scepticism with which those beneficial government proposals will be received will drastically reduce their impact and the chances of them being implemented .
Argumentative	 if i do not trust that the government is looking after my own good , but rather in a lot of instances its interests are mutually exclusive with mine , then i would most probably lose my respect towards authority .
Argumentative	 when talking about law enforcement agencies , i.e the police , the nsa , etc. , it is clear that we have trusted them to protect us and our rights .
Argumentative	 when it is those very agencies that are conducting these warrantless spying campaigns , it comes as a direct contradiction with their very purpose and thus the impact and the loss of trust is higher on this level .
Argumentative	 moreover , in the long term , the whole electoral process could suffer a lot from this lack of confidence , as individuals are n't particularly inclined to go to elections any more if they see that no matter what they do , their rights will still be breached .
Argumentative	 as you need the population to trust the government , so that its reforms are being met with positivism and not reluctance , you must not portray the government as an intrusive , harmful and ill-willing element of the society .
Argumentative	 surveillance changes the way we make daily decisions -- the same way that a rapidly approaching police car in your rear-view mirror may make you feel nervous even when you are driving completely lawfully .
Argumentative	 the very existence of a mass surveillance system will negatively influence the behaviour and emotions of a significant majority of the population .
Argumentative	 first , surveillance affects emotions and mental performance , as it leads to heightened levels of stress , fatigue and anxiety due to the constant feeling that you are being watched .
Argumentative	  secondly , it creates conformity to social norms .
Argumentative	 `` in a series of classic experiments during the 1950s , psychologist solomon asch showed that conformity is so powerful that individuals will follow the crowd even when the crowd is obviously wrong .
Argumentative	 a government that engages in mass surveillance can not claim to value innovation , critical thinking , or originality . ''
Argumentative	  this is of extreme importance as first of all , it is the state 's duty to create the most peaceful and harmonious environment in which the individual can reach its full potential , this one clearly not being it , and second if we do n't feel free to do things that are perfectly legal because we think someone might think it suspicious or out of character then it is difficult to say we are really free .
