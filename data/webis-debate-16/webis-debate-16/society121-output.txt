Non-Argumentative	the right of asylum is a juridical concept, under which a person, in this case a woman, persecuted by her own government may be protected by another sovereign authority, a foreign country, or a union of countries.
Non-Argumentative	legislation is a law that has been enacted by a governing body and is currently part of the legal system in that country with the purpose to regulate, authorize, sanction, grant or restrict certain individual liberties.
Non-Argumentative	discriminatory legislation against women is not restricted to any one region or group of states but is best known in countries such as saudi arabia and others with legal system strongly influenced by sharia, the moral code and religious law of islam.
Non-Argumentative	 even if the quran states that men and women are equal, it also sustains that “men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because allah has made one of them to respect the other, and because they spend from their means.”
Non-Argumentative	sharia law applies in full, covering personal status issues as well as criminal proceedings, in mauritania, sudan, saudi arabia, yemen, iraq, iran etc. there are also countries in which sharia applies in personal status issues only (marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody), which is the case in much of the middle east north africa region but there it is also applied in some regions of indonesia.
Non-Argumentative	 it should be noted that not all islamic countries apply sharia law.
Non-Argumentative	 discrimination can take a wide verity of different forms.
Non-Argumentative	 at its worst women become the “property” of the man and they cannot pursue anything without his approval.
Non-Argumentative	 they are treated poorly by not being equal in front of the justice system, punishment for adultery consist most of the times in stoning or female genitalia mutilation.
Non-Argumentative	 elsewhere however discrimination may simply be unequal representation in the political system.
Argumentative	    everyone is equal .
Argumentative	 women who live under legal system that permits discrimination against them are being denied of basic human rights whether this is the right to vote , to a fair trial , or bodily integrity .
Argumentative	 sharia law , for example , clearly denies them human rights like equality before the law , a basic human need according to universal declaration of human rights .
Argumentative	 `` all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law . ''
Argumentative	 under sharia a woman 's testimony is worth half a man 's and she gets half the inheritance of her male siblings .
Argumentative	 second of all , bodily integrity is affected when women are stoned to death or beaten by their husbands without them even being punished .
Argumentative	 the importance of self-determination and autonomy are neglected in saudi arabia where women are not allowed to drive or go alone in public .
Argumentative	 female genital mutilation , which causes bleeding , infections and infertility , and is almost always done without the girl 's consent , is a big problem in many african countries .
Argumentative	 asylum given by the eu shall be the only way for these women to leave the system that persecutes them and be able to have their human needs respected and therefore creating a healthier , safer and better environment .
Argumentative	 the european union is not able to protect women in other countries that are not a part of the union .
Argumentative	 countries that have legislation discriminating against women are clearly not listening to european urgings on human rights .
Argumentative	 they will not respond to these urgings social and cultural traditions are deeply ingrained and only slowly change .
Argumentative	 where women are seen as second-tier citizens it is seen as a natural part of the society can barely walk to the corner of the street without the consent of their husband .
Argumentative	 moreover , the situation in countries with legislated discrimination against women is not improving , in countries which were previously secular there is increasingly a challenge from islamism as in libya and egypt during the ` arab spring ' .
Argumentative	 moreover the influence of the european union is declining ; it has always been primarily financial , through aid which is declining , and through investment which , at least in the mena , region has reversed as a result of those same revolutions .
Argumentative	 by granting asylum we can help them escape a legal system that clearly is against them and replace it with a european union legal system that grants them those rights they never had .
Argumentative	 sometimes , women who are persecuted by their government end up running from their country just to be sent back from the eu when their asylum application is rejected .
Argumentative	 under the current legal system , the problems of women from countries that implement sharia law and other forms of discrimination are often not considered sufficient grounds for asylum .
Argumentative	 this is because refugees are only considered to be refugees ` owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ' , so it does not include persecution for gender .
Argumentative	 the consequences can be of two kinds .
Argumentative	 the first and the worst is sending them back home where to face harsh punishment for trying to leave .
Argumentative	 this was the case with two women who applied for asylum in great britain inand were denied this right even though they faced death by stoning upon return .
Argumentative	 even if the women are not sent home immediately due to a prolonged appeals process they are left in detention centers , in uncomfortable conditions and unable to get a job or do anything while they wait .
Argumentative	 those who are denied entry are left with nothing only a long depressing wait to be returned to the horrible conditions from which they thought they had escaped .
Argumentative	 there is a moral obligation for such a powerful and diverse group of nations to protect not only their own citizens but also people in desperate need all around the world .
Argumentative	 all the countries in the eu have signed the universal declaration of human rights and therefore stand behind its principles .
Argumentative	 as the world biggest economic power the eu is fully capable of doing so .
Argumentative	 the union is wealthy enough that it can take in the extra migrants that would occur as a result of taking in women from countries where they face discriminatory legislation .
Argumentative	 the european union 's international image is not based on its military might but upon its economy and on being upstanding in its promotion of a human rights agenda .
Argumentative	 granting asylum to women that live under discriminatory legal system reinforces this image of being concerned for human rights .
Argumentative	 the european union has signed up to the united nations ' convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women by which signatories `` agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women '' while the convention is calling for the elimination of discrimination internally it is fully in the spirit of the convention to undertake actions that encourage others to fulfill the convention .
Argumentative	 by being willing to grant asylum to women from countries that have not lived up to the standards of the convention -- which includes `` to adopt appropriate legislative and other measures , including sanctions where appropriate , prohibiting all discrimination against women '' -- the european union will put pressure on these regimes , helping to highlight their unequal systems .
Argumentative	 women who are constantly threatened by their husbands or who are in societies where they are considered to represent less than a man will most certainly lack ambition to achieve their full potential -- or even if they do have the ambition will be restrained from fulfilling it .
Argumentative	 when you live under a system that considers you inferior to the other gender and denies you opportunities on the basis of gender -- sometimes including education the individual is clearly never going to have a chance to make their life worthwhile for its own sake .
Argumentative	 they wo n't be able to take up jobs that will have an impact on the world , they wo n't control their own economic circumstances as their husband is the only breadwinner , and they will be denied the opportunity to express their ideas and views .
Argumentative	 by giving them asylum in a place where women and men are treated equally , we give them the opportunity to do whatever they wanted to do before .
Argumentative	 besides the security that they will gain , they will be able to go to school or get a job more easily than in their native country .
Argumentative	 there is no reason for which we do n't want these women to be a part of our european cultural identity .
Argumentative	 it is shameful to give this opportunity only to your citizens when women from countries that discriminate against them might be able to contribute so much more than they are able to under their circumstances in their native country .
