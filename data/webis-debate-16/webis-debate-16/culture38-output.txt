Non-Argumentative	rupert murdoch’s news corporation is a multinational media corporation with interests in books, cable and satellite television, films, magazines, newspapers and websites.
Non-Argumentative	 it is influential around the world and in its portfolio news corporation includes very influential channels and publications.
Non-Argumentative	 fox news is perhaps the best known of these for its right wing perspective in the united states while in the uk the sun, a tabloid newspaper, claimed to have won theelection for john major proclaiming it was ‘the sun wot won it’.

Non-Argumentative	behind this question is both a general question of whether murdoch is a fit person to be running such a large and influential media conglomerate around the world or whether he has been misusing that power and a more local context within the uk.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk the broadcasting acts ofand ofcharges upon ofcom, the media and communications watchdog, the duty to distribute broadcasting licences and says ofcom “shall not grant a licence to any person unless they are satisfied that he is a fit and proper person to hold it”.
Non-Argumentative	 however the broadcasting acts do not define exactly what is ‘fit and proper’ but the actions of controlling directors and shareholders are taken into account; as such murdoch could threaten the ability of the companies he controls to be considered fit.
Argumentative	 those running media corporations should be morally upright people who control their media companies in the public interest as these are organisations that potentially have a lot of influence through their control of information .
Argumentative	 this is however not at all how rupert murdoch ran news corp or his newspapers .
Argumentative	 murdoch has been running his empire in pursuit of power and to advance a right wing agenda .
Argumentative	 his influence was such that even naturally left wing parties such as new labour under tony blair stuck to right wing or wing orthodoxies in order to keep the support of the murdoch press .
Argumentative	 murdoch was therefore pushing narrow interests rather than the public interest .
Argumentative	 murdoch 's news corporation has shown their lack of moral scruples not just by engaging in industrial scale hacking but also by its determination to use its contacts to close down investigations by parliament or the police as well as being willing to destroy evidence and lie when giving evidence .
Argumentative	 tom watson mp has gone so far as to accuse murdoch of being `` the first mafia boss in history who did n't know he was running a criminal enterprise '' .

Argumentative	 rupert murdoch has an immense empire and if we believe his testimony obviously did not have as much control over his publications , or take as much responsibility for them , as he should have done .
Argumentative	 murdoch himself has claimed `` someone took charge of a cover-up we were victim to and i regret that . ''
Argumentative	 this was a cover up within the news of the world and news international that kept murdoch out of the loop and misinformed on phone hacking , showing that he was unable to keep control over his businesses when he was the one with ultimate responsibility for the actions of that company .
Argumentative	 the commons culture committee concluded that murdoch was essentially negligent `` at all relevant times rupert murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone-hacking , he turned a blind eye and exhibited wilful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications . ''
Argumentative	 the media 's role is to increase transparency and bring others to account .
Argumentative	 murdoch himself in his testimony to leveson said `` if we 're a transparent society , a transparent democracy , let 's have it out there '' yet he has been exactly the opposite in terms of accountability and transparency .
Argumentative	 the house of commons select committee on culture , media and sport has published a report in which it concludes that the culture of the publication , news of the world , was `` throughout , until it was too late , was to cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing and discipline the perpetrators , as they also professed they would do after the criminal convictions . ''
Argumentative	 the strategy was to blame individuals and when such a containment strategy failed to shut down the news of the world so as to protect top bosses .
Argumentative	 news international was clearly not living up to high standards of transparency .
