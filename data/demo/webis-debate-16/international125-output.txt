Non-Argumentative	uganda hit the international headlines in lateand earlydue to controversy over an anti-gay law proposed by parliament and passed by the president.
Non-Argumentative	the initial bill commonly known as “kill the gays bill” was proposed by mp david bahati inand approved by parliament in decemberbefore being sent to the state house for final confirmation.
Non-Argumentative	 mr bahati argued that he would fight to see the bill passed claiming that it was aimed at protecting children and conserving the country’s values; “because we are a god-fearing nation, we value life in a holistic way.
Non-Argumentative	 it is because of those values that members of parliament passed this bill regardless of what the outside world thinks”[1] he noted after the parliamentary vote to support the bill.
Non-Argumentative	despite international pressure from various countries such as the usa and uk as well as from humanitarian organisations worldwide to stop the progress of the bill uganda’s president passed it as law in february 2014.
Non-Argumentative	 president museveni proclaimed he did so to show that uganda is an independent country which won’t create laws just to suit other countries agendas [2].
Non-Argumentative	the anti-homosexuality act metes out jail terms of up to life for "aggravated homosexuality" while "aiding and abetting homosexuality" is punishable by seven year prison sentences.
Non-Argumentative	 it includes penalties for individuals, companies, media organisations, or non-governmental organisations that reach out to gay people or support lgbt rights.
Non-Argumentative	 individuals can be sentenced to seven years in jail.
Non-Argumentative	 organisations will be shut down.
Non-Argumentative	the response from around the world has mostly been critical.
Non-Argumentative	 the un secretary general ban ki-moon spoke against the law stressing that it violates basic human rights and endangers the lgbt community in uganda[3].
Non-Argumentative	 south africa’s nobel peace prize winner desmond tutu argued that there is no scientific justification for prejudice and discrimination ever, and called on museveni to strengthen uganda's culture of human rights and justice[4].
Non-Argumentative	 president obama in a written statement against the move noted; the new law “will be more than an affront and a danger to the gay community in uganda.
Non-Argumentative	 it will be a step backward for all ugandans and reflect poorly on uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people”.
Argumentative	 it is therefore a question of concern, has the ugandan government failed its citizens on lgbt rights?
Argumentative	human rights are fundamental and universal .
Argumentative	 they do not only apply to a certain group of people and invalid to another such as homosexuals .
Argumentative	 criminalising homosexuality in uganda considers all in the lgbt minority to be worse than second class citizens .
Argumentative	 making them almost automatically criminal renders homosexuals sub human depriving them of their identity as ugandans .
Argumentative	 the government has a responsibility to protect every citizen but in this case the ugandan government has taken the first step in rejecting and mistreating its own people .
Argumentative	 the new law infringes on fundamental rights to privacy , non-discrimination , equality and freedom from cruelty and inhumane treatment  .
Argumentative	 even before the bill was introduced the government prevented there being room for lgbt activists to explain their cause showing their lack of freedom of expression .
Argumentative	 this and rights such as equality are universal and fundamental rights that the government of uganda has on numerous occasions signed up for in the universal declaration of human rights and the african charter on human and peoples rights among other documents .
Argumentative	  articleof the ugandan constitution is clear in its separation of church and state `` uganda shall not have a state religion . ''
Argumentative	 the government must serve all its people equally regardless religious and cultural orientation .
Argumentative	 but this bill has been created with a religious motive .
Argumentative	 in his interview defending the anti-gay bill , mp david bahati lamented , that god does n't accept homosexuality quoting a bible verse that the wages of sin is death  ; as if the ugandan parliament is filled with righteous souls !
Argumentative	 the constitution allows freedom of religion and prohibits the creation of political parties based on religion  .
Argumentative	 laws and policies should therefore not base on bible verses as not everyone will share the same belief to such scriptures .
Argumentative	 chapterof the ugandan constitution recognises fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual as inherent and not granted by the state .
Argumentative	 the constitution states ; all persons are equal before and under the law in all spheres of political , economic , social and cultural life and in every other respect and shall enjoy equal protection of the law ; without prejudice , a person shall not be discriminated against on the ground of sex , race , colour , ethnic origin , tribe , birth , creed or religion , or social or economic standing , political opinion or disability  .
Argumentative	 it defines `` discriminate '' as giving different treatment to different persons attributable only or mainly to their respective descriptions by sex , race , colour , ethnic origin , tribe , birth , creed or religion , or social or economic standing , political opinion or disability .
Argumentative	 the government has acted contrary to their own law , with president museveni remarking that what homosexuals do is disgusting , un african and had no place in his country  and mp david bahati , asserting that homosexuals do not deserve to be treated as humans .
Argumentative	 breaching such a law while relying on such logical fallacies is a sign of how the government failed on human rights .
