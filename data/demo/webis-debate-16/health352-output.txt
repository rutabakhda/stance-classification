Non-Argumentative	ivf (in vitro fertilization) treatment is a medical procedure to assist infertile (or otherwise unable) couples to conceive children.
Non-Argumentative	 the process involves fertilizing egg cells with sperm outside of the womb (in vitro), and then transferring the fertilized egg (zygote) into either the biological mother’s womb, or the womb of a surrogate.
Non-Argumentative	 babies conceived through ivf are colloquially known as ‘test tube babies’.
Non-Argumentative	 pregnancy rates are around 35% (although this varies a lot between clinics), which means that many couples need to go through several ‘cycles’ of treatment before successfully conceiving – this is one of the reasons why costs are so high.
Non-Argumentative	 prices for one cycle of treatment range from around $4000 in japan to $12,500 in the usa.
Non-Argumentative	 the overall cost per live birth ranges from $40,000 in the usa and the uk to $24,500 in scandinavia and japan.
Non-Argumentative	 some countries (e.g. belgium, sweden, australia and israel) provide funding for several cycles of ivf, while the uk’s nhs provides funding for just one cycle.
Non-Argumentative	 countries, which have currently implemented the policy of public funding, have strict regulations regarding for those desiring publicly funded ivf.
Non-Argumentative	 usually there are publicly funded consultations and publicly funded treatments.
Non-Argumentative	  in new zealand, the duration of infertility has to be at least one year and it has to be known to doctors that there is a severe cause for the infertility.
Non-Argumentative	 also in auckland specific eligibility criteria are that the woman has to be less thanyears old at referral, is not obese and has not been smoking for at leastmonths before the treatment.
Non-Argumentative	 similar policies, which will be eligible for public funding, could also be implemented in other countries.
Non-Argumentative	  the debate can be set up by the proposition as providing one or more cycles as part of a national health service (so the state actually provides the treatment), or as the state subsidizing patients to receive the treatment privately.

Argumentative	  having children is such an important aspect of most people 's lives that it should be considered a right .
Argumentative	 for many people , their status as parents is a key part of their identity , and their devotion towards their children is indicative of how important parenting is to them .
Argumentative	 the right to start a family is recognized in articleof the european convention on human rights and articleof the universal declaration of human rights .
Argumentative	 however , this right is apportioned unevenly .
Argumentative	 couples who are unable to have children naturally , either because of medical infertility or because they are a same-sex couple , are unable to conceive children unless they are wealthy enough to afford private ivf treatment .
Argumentative	 this may affect many people given the extremely high cost of ivf treatment .
Argumentative	 being unable to exercise this right should not depend on income , so the state must financially assist couples who are unable to afford treatment .
Argumentative	 and even if we believe this right is not basic , and more a choice of a lifestyle , if the state has the possibility to ensure it to everyone , why not maximize rights and make as many people happy as possible .
Argumentative	 if the state funded ivf treatment , it would overcome some of the inefficiencies involved in expensive medical treatment .
Argumentative	 costs would be brought down as economies of scale are exploited , and state health services have better bargaining power when it comes to purchasing large orders of drugs and equipment .
Argumentative	 a higher rate of treatment within the population would increase safety and improve outcomes , thus reducing costs , as medical departments become more experienced .
Argumentative	 most significantly , an asymmetry of information exists between doctor and patient , as it does with all medical treatment , -- patients are not aware of what services they need , and are unable to weigh up the various options available to them , because doing so requires medical training .
Argumentative	 this drives up prices , as doctors have incentives to ` over treat ' patients , and not to treat patients in the most cost-effective manner .
Argumentative	 providing state funding would make the state the purchaser of ivf services , or even the direct provider of them , removing either the ability to over treat or the incentive to do so , depending on whether the state is the buyer or the provider .
Argumentative	 most couples which decide to do ivf treatments do not have unlimited funds available to them .
Argumentative	 therefore , once they decide to do ivf treatments in order to reduce the costs of more cycles , couples and clinicians , with only private funds , typically opt to implant numerous embryos , hoping at least one will survive .
Argumentative	 while this may reduce the cost of treatments , it can result in `` multiples '' -- anything from twins to the infamous `` octomom '' octoplets .
Argumentative	 multiples tend to be born prematurely and have a high rate of health problems , which can result in tremendous medical costs and life-long expenses , such as special education .
Argumentative	 through the ivf treatments the early numbers in quebec show , only 3.8 per cent of pregnancies in the ivf program are now multiples , down sharply from 27.2 per cent.
Argumentative	so with the public funding , two benefits are safer treatment of mother and child , since only one implant at a time gets implanted , and reduced cost of ivf treatment for parents .
Argumentative	 there are benefits to the state in promoting fertility treatments and so encouraging more people to have children .
Argumentative	 most developed countries have rapidly aging populations with too few young people to be able to maintain their pensions systems over the next thirty years .
Argumentative	 to avert demographic crisis governments need to do more to encourage couples to start families .
Argumentative	 many states already support couples who have children through the benefits system ; some like italy even pay a lump sum to couples on the birth of each child .
Argumentative	 funding ivf to increase the number of births is an obvious extension of this principle .
Argumentative	 it would also be right for society through the state to fund ivf , as career expectations and the high costs of housing force many couples now delay starting a family until they are in their thirties , by which time they may need medical help to conceive .
