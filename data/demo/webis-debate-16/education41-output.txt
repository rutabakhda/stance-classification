Argumentative	the main goal of this program is increasing school enrollment overall .
Argumentative	 if it was too much to expect from families , then the program would have failed in the cases that it was instituted .
Argumentative	 however , the opposite has been the case .
Argumentative	 12.4 million families in brazil are enrolled in a program called bolsa familia where children 's attendance in school is rewarded with $a month per child .
Argumentative	 the number of brazilians with incomes below $a month has decreased by% year since, and 1/6 of the poverty reduction in the country is attributed to this program .
Argumentative	 additionally it is much less expensive than other programs , costing only about .5 % of the country 's gdp .
Argumentative	 considering that this program has been affordable and successful in both reducing poverty and increasing school enrollment it is worth using as an incentive in more programs around the world .
Argumentative	 when society has to step in and provide for those who 've proved themselves unable to provide for themselves that should reasonably create certain expectations on the part of those being helped .
Argumentative	 in almost every aspect of life , money is given in return for a product , service or behavior .
Argumentative	 it is the same with welfare payments ; money in exchange for children being put in school .
Argumentative	 we expect parents to do a good job in their role as parents .
Argumentative	 ensuring that their children attend school is a crucial part of parental responsibility .
Argumentative	 children on welfare in the us aretimes more likely to drop out of school , however studies have shown that children who are part of early childhood education are more likely to finish school and remain independent of welfare1 .
Argumentative	 thus , when a parent is a welfare recipient , it is entirely reasonable to make it conditional on sending their kids to school .
Argumentative	 if tax payers ' dollars are being spent on those who can not provide for themselves , there needs to be a societal return .
Argumentative	 one of the greatest complaints about welfare is that people work hard for the money that they earn , which is then handed to others with no direct benefit to society .
Argumentative	 if children of people on welfare are in school it increases the likelihood that they will finish high school , maybe get a scholarship and go to college , and have the necessary tools to contribute to the work force and better society .
