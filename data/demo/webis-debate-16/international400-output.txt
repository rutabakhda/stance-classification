Non-Argumentative	in 1962, fourteen years after myanmar (then burma) gained independence, a military coup led by general ne win resulted in the abolition of the federal system and the creation of a single-party state.
Non-Argumentative	 this was coupled with the nationalisation of the economy and a ban on independent newspapers.
Non-Argumentative	 general ne win remained in power for twenty-six years - as military ruler until 1974, as president of the people’s assembly (appointed under a new constitution) fromto 1981, and as the head of the ruling party fromto 1988.
Non-Argumentative	in this period, poverty reached extremely high levels in myanmar.
Non-Argumentative	 currency devaluation inled to a massive economic crisis and anti-government riots.
Non-Argumentative	 another military coup inreplaced the existing political leadership and a new ruling junta came to power, which renamed burma as myanmar.
Non-Argumentative	in 1990, multi-party elections were held and the national league for democracy (nld, the main opposition party) emerged as the comprehensive winner.
Non-Argumentative	 however, the military junta refused to transfer power and placed nld leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest for six years.
Non-Argumentative	 a constitution review process was commenced, and in the subsequent years, nld members were involved in both negotiations with and protests against the ruling junta, as a result of which many nld members faced imprisonment and house arrest.
Non-Argumentative	  aung san suu kyi was placed under house arrest again formonths, released in 2002, imprisoned in 2003, and then transferred to house arrest.
Non-Argumentative	in this period, a new draft of the constitution was approved in a national referendum (2008) and electoral laws were changed in advance of elections in november 2010, which were the first elections in myanmar since 1990.
Non-Argumentative	 the military-backed union solidarity and development party claimed victory in these elections.
Non-Argumentative	 nld boycotted the process and was officially disbanded,  aung san suu kyi was prevented from participating and then released from house arrest after the elections, which were criticised for being a sham and for the occurrence of fraud.
Non-Argumentative	 the nld was however allowed to contestbyelections in aprilwhere the party wonof the seats.
Non-Argumentative	 currently, a civilian government headed by president thein sein (said to be handpicked by than shwe, the leader of the military junta) is in power, while many of the top posts are occupied by individuals who were formerly members of the military junta.1there have been large-scale violations of human rights under the military junta, including in relation to political insurgents and separatist movements.
Non-Argumentative	 there have also been unverified reports that myanmar may be building nuclear facilities with the help of north korea.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states (us) and the european union (eu) (along with canada, japan, australia and new zealand) have placed long-standing economic and political sanctions, arms embargoes, restrictions on providing aid to and trade with myanmar, though there has been some political engagement involving officials of the us government and the un.
Non-Argumentative	 regionally, however, myanmar has trade and political relations with its asian neighbours, continues to be a member of the asean.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore, the arguments below are from the perspective of the west (mainly us and eu).
Argumentative	 ‘reengagement’ refers to the removal of economic sanctions and resumption of normal diplomatic relations with myanmar.
Argumentative	the isolation of myanmar by some of the developed western powers is arbitrary and marked by hypocrisy .
Argumentative	 the real reasons for the stance taken by these countries are political .
Argumentative	 there is little consistency in the attitude taken towards other governments and dictatorships across the world that also have questionable human rights records , saudi arabia and egypt , to name a few , but either offer other strategic and economic benefits , or are much more influential in international affairs than myanmar .
Argumentative	 myanmar is only part of a group of countries , also including cuba and north korea , whose economic and political policies have remained relatively opaque to arm-twisting by the us and the eu .
Argumentative	 it is unfair to impose sanctions on and isolate myanmar on this basis , especially in an emerging multi-polar international environment .
Argumentative	 myanmar has taken significant steps towards democratisation in the last three years .
Argumentative	 the new constitution and the elections that resulted in the current civilian government being appointed represent a marked shift in its governance structure .
Argumentative	 though there may be scope for improvement in its democratic framework , institutions for democratic functioning have been created and this is a huge step forward .
Argumentative	 aung san suu kyi has also been released from house arrest , and the tone of the statements made by the new government has been a reconciliatory one .
Argumentative	 a new human rights commission has also been established .
Argumentative	 while the pace of reform may not match the supposed expectations of the us and the eu , myanmar 's choice to change gradually and engage with them on its own terms must be respected .
Argumentative	 the fundamental circumstances under which a policy of limited engagement was adopted with myanmar have changed , and this calls for reassessment .
Argumentative	 reengagement has potential for having a positive influence in various contexts .
Argumentative	 myanmar is rich in natural resources , including forest products , minerals and gems .
Argumentative	 removing trade restrictions and offering developmental aid would benefit the local economy and population .1 in the longer term , economic activity can act as a stimulus for development of a stronger legal and business framework to reduce corruption .
Argumentative	 if the us and the eu create confidence in the myanmar government that they are willing to offer something constructive rather than critical , it may be possible to ask for greater transparency in government and reduce systematic violations of human rights as well .2 the newly elected civilian government has indicated it is willing to pursue democratic reform , and the us and the eu should not lose this opportunity for change .
Argumentative	 the policy of disengagement has not resulted in any meaningful change in myanmar , politically or economically .
Argumentative	 since myanmar has not been dependent on the us or the eu , sanctions and arms embargoes have not had any effect on the government .
Argumentative	 the changes in 2010-2011 have been due to the influence of the nld , and certain regional players , like thailand and china , which have sought to directly engage with myanmar .
Argumentative	 further , the sections of the population that are most affected by the sanctions are those not in the top tier of the political and economic class , but smaller manufacturers and the working class .
Argumentative	 restrictions on exports and developmental aid from the us and the eu prevent local manufacturers and consumers from having access to them .
Argumentative	 on the other hand , restrictions on imports from myanmar weaken the market for its exporters .
Argumentative	 these factors only further impoverish and alienate the local population , increasing economic disparity , and consequently the power of the ruling elite in the national context as well .
Argumentative	 myanmar has continuing economic and political relations with many other countries , including members of the asean , and significantly , china , which is also the source of a large proportion of foreign investment in myanmar .
Argumentative	 these countries , some of which are major economic and political partners of the us and the eu , do not share the same attitude about the legitimacy of the myanmar government and the approach that should be taken towards it .
Argumentative	 for the purposes of regional stability , it would be better for the us and the eu to align their positions with the others .
Argumentative	 this reduces the risk of diplomatic rifts which could destabilise the region .
Argumentative	 further , if the international community presents a united viewpoint on what steps myanmar should take to improve its democracy , such steps are more likely to be taken .
