Non-Argumentative	in the wake of the banking crisis of 2008, significant press coverage was given to the large salaries, bonuses and pensions being paid to certain individuals in banking and finance, which were seen as being excessively high in relation to both the social worth of those jobs, and to what salary is needed to live a reasonably comfortable life.
Non-Argumentative	 this echoed common media narratives surrounding the excessive pay of groups such as footballers, lawyers, actors, and singers, especially as compared to jobs that are commonly accepted as having significant social worth, such as nurses and teachers.
Non-Argumentative	this requires some clear definitions; a broad definition of salary should be taken (to include pensions, stock options, bonuses etc.) to ensure that a salary cap could not in practice be avoided.
Non-Argumentative	 furthermore, it should be clear if entrepreneur's 'salary' (i.e. profits from their companies) should be included; it is suggested that it is included, to ensure proposition's arguments on levels of equality are principally consistent.
Argumentative	 finally, the debate is helped if a figure is placed on the maximum salary; the arguments below are not harmed by establishing a maximum salary of $150,000 (with a possibly allowance for a bonus of up to $30,000).
Argumentative	this system would be best implemented by imposing a mandatory% tax on all personal income over $ 150,000 , and all bonuses over $ 30,000 .
Argumentative	 this means that some revenue could still be raised from this if people did continue to pay large salaries and bonuses , although they are unlikely to do so .
Argumentative	 furthermore , it would be best implemented through international cooperation , to limit the opportunity of one country to be able to offer higher salaries and poach talented individuals .
Argumentative	 countries may agree to this as it prevents a ` race to the top ' in salaries , where companies have to offer more and more money to attract the best people .
Argumentative	 as a result of having to pay important directors and employees a lower wage , businesses will be able to produce their goods and services for a lower cost , and sell therefore sell them for a lower price .
Argumentative	 this will lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth , as the poorest will become relatively richer , as prices will fall .
Argumentative	 this will also be true for small businesses , which will be able to obtain cheaper legal and financial advice and business consultancy , and are therefore more likely to succeed .
Argumentative	 sports provide a good example of this .
Argumentative	 in major league baseball salaries for the players more than doubled in real terms betweenandwhile ticket prices rose% .
Argumentative	 as players wages take more than% of teams revenues a cap would mean a significant cut in costs that could be passed on to the consumer .1 when wages are better standardized across professions , people are less likely to feel socially pressured into seeking out a higher paid job .
Argumentative	 as such , they are more likely to choose their job on the basis of other factors , such as how much they enjoy the job , or how ethical the working practices of a company are .
Argumentative	 this will lead to happier , and hence more productive , employees .
Argumentative	 some resources -- most notably housing -- are very important to large numbers of people , and owning them gives people a great deal of happiness .
Argumentative	 this policy will limit richer people owning several properties while others live in rented accommodation or smaller houses , as price competition for such properties will be less intense , and poorer people will be better able to compete through savings .
Argumentative	 estimates insuggested there were 6.8 million second homes in the usa1.
Argumentative	this is a good thing , as it is likely that a person , or family , values their first property more than another person values their second property , known as the law of diminishing marginal returns .
Argumentative	 this is perhaps the best example of the ways in which inequality leads to worse outcomes for society .
Argumentative	 firstly , it limits social tension that may arise due to public dissatisfaction with high wages ; see the attacks on the famous banker sir fred goodwin in the uk1 .
Argumentative	 secondly , people may feel that society recognizes them as being more equal , increasing the perceived self-worth of many , avoiding feelings of inferiority and worry about their social worth , and making them feel closer to other people .
Argumentative	 see , for example , sweden , which has the lowest gini coefficient , indicating low levels of inequality , in the world , and also some of the highest levels of gdp per capita , life expectancy and literacy rates , and low levels of crime and obesity2 .
Argumentative	 furthermore , a forbes report suggests sweden is one of the happiest countries in the world , along with denmark , finland and norway ,other countries with a low gini coefficient ,.
