Non-Argumentative	even starting at the extreme of murder, it’s surprisingly difficult to demonstrate why it is immoral without coming to the conclusion that it’s mainly a crime because it denies the victim choice.
Non-Argumentative	 so where a person chooses to die is there even a moral issue at all, let alone a legal one?
Non-Argumentative	at one extreme, there’s the issue of turning off the life-support machine of a patient in a permanent vegetative state, at the other giving assistance to an otherwise healthy individual who simply no longer wants to live.
Non-Argumentative	 of course there’s then a step beyond that where no assistance is required and the individual commits suicide themselves, what should their family’s and wider society’s response to that be?
Non-Argumentative	the issue of the right to life is one that exercises many commentators and furious legislative debate.
Non-Argumentative	 the right to die – and our wider relationship to death – is one that has tended to receive less attention and, when it has done so, the debate has tended to be conducted in muted tones with very few hard and fast moral principles to cling onto.
Non-Argumentative	 in part, this is, perhaps, inevitable.
Non-Argumentative	 as a species the desire to live is hard wired into our dna and it is difficult to conceive that, for some, they may have reached an entirely rational and reasonable decision that they have finished with life.
Non-Argumentative	 it is much easier to conjure the image of a baby and make the case that it should not be denied its potential than it is to face a grown adult who is in obvious pain and tell them that they just have to put up with it.
Non-Argumentative	debaters’ noteclearly this debate covers an enormous number of topics; political, legal, philosophical, ethical, medical and others.
Non-Argumentative	 from the point of view of proposition, it is important to nail down a tight definition.
Non-Argumentative	 it’s important to give the parameters in which the right to die would apply otherwise opposition can easily portray the situation of people wandering into emergency rooms and asking to end it all because they’ve had a bad day.
Non-Argumentative	 does the right to die exist only in the case of a terminal medical condition?
Non-Argumentative	 is old age a sufficient justification?
Non-Argumentative	 are psychological and medical examinations of the individual required?
Non-Argumentative	 what protection is there from relatives killing off their relations and then insisting that it was suicide?
Non-Argumentative	 if ever there was a debate in which prop needs to give a clear overview of how the process would work, then this is it.
Non-Argumentative	 they should aim to set out a process in which it has been demonstrated that the potential suicide is in full control of her own mental faculties and has not been placed under pressure by others to end her life.
Non-Argumentative	 even with these secured opposition may argue, as some ethicists have, that the decision to commit suicide is, itself, prima fasciae evidence of a disturbed mind.
Non-Argumentative	 prop would also do well to place the debate over assisted suicide in countries where regular suicide is already legal – it’s simply an easier case to argue.
Argumentative	 neither of these issues arise with either assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia .
Argumentative	 proposition has no difficulty at all with the suggestion that both procedures should be regulated and take place in safe , medically supported , environments .
Argumentative	 however , if an individual accepts that death is their preferred option in such a scenario , it is difficult to comprehend of reasons why they should not be allowed to proceed .
Argumentative	 our social rejection of murder does not , ultimately relate to death itself but to the denial of choice .
Argumentative	 with murder someone is denying that person all their future potential so denying their freedom of choice , and this remains the case even if the murder was completely painless .
Argumentative	 here , reason tells us , the virtuous act is death and the reservation of that choice .
Argumentative	 the determining element of humanity is that we are rational beings ; a blanket ban -- legal and social -- on choosing the time and manner of our deaths reflects our primeval fear of a death that comes , unwanted , in the dark of the night , not the mature judgement of modern , thinking , and long-lived , humans .
Argumentative	 let us consider the example of the cancer patient who opts not to put herself through the agony and uncertainty of chemotherapy .
Argumentative	 in such a circumstance , we accept that a person may accept the certainty of death with grace and reason rather than chasing after a slim probability of living longer but in pain .
Argumentative	 all proposition is arguing is that this approach can also apply to other conditions , which may not be terminal in the strict sense of the world but certainly lead to the death of that person in any meaningful sense .
Argumentative	 the application of medical science to extend a life , long after life is ` worth living ' or would be possible to live without these interventions can not be considered a moral good for its own sake .
Argumentative	 many find that they are facing the prospect of living out the rest of their days in physical pain or are losing their memory .
Argumentative	 as a result , some may see ` going out at the top of their game ' as the better , and more natural , option .
Argumentative	 ultimately , the decision to die is a personal one , it may affect others but , clearly it has the greatest impact on the person who decides to die .
Argumentative	 clearly those who remain behind will have to deal with the consequences of that death and the end of their relationship with that person but , one would hope , that would be the case if she had died of natural causes at a later date .
Argumentative	 furthermore the experience of watching someone die can by as traumatic , or more so , for the carer or loved one than it is for the individual concerned .
Argumentative	 what it clearly is not , is an issue for legislators and other strangers who have no connection to the person involved .
Argumentative	 there are deeply personal issues such as love , death , sex , and reproduction where we accept the state may have a role in the formal sense of preventing their abuse but otherwise should not have an opinion either way .
Argumentative	 with the right to die the state has maintained not only an opinion but a criminal sanction .
Argumentative	 this is a clear example of where the role of the state is to respect the individual and step back ; legislation is far too cumbersome a tool with be used in circumstances as varied and complex as these .
Argumentative	 dealing with the loss of a loved one , particularly in a situation such as assisted suicide , is painful and traumatic enough for all concerned without adding to that the additional stress of a threat of criminal sanction .
