Argumentative	national security concerns around terrorism mean that it is necessary to have a deterrent that will help prevent the recruitment of terrorists .
Argumentative	 terrorism is one of the biggest threats to western countries today and this is potentially an effective way of dealing with it .
Argumentative	 traditional military responses to terrorism do not work due to terrorists ' underground nature and decentralised cell structure that operates throughout the world .
Argumentative	 it is even questionable whether ` al qaeda ' as a group exists at all except as an identity for those wanting to attack the west to operate under .
Argumentative	 efforts against terrorism therefore need to be aimed at preventing radicalisation and stopping individuals rather than attempting to destroy the whole group known as al qaeda .
Argumentative	 this law not only deters people from becoming extremists through making them think twice about visiting extremist websites but it also helps to deter promoters of extremism through denying them an audience .
Argumentative	 if punishing users of extremist websites prevents even a few people who would otherwise have visited these websites from doing so and setting out on a part of radicalisation that leads to terrorism then it will have been a success .
Argumentative	 the internet may be a free for all where all ideas and viewpoints can be found but that does not mean that all users view all these views .
Argumentative	 instead the internet acts as an echo chamber that encourages people to believe their own views are correct and so get more extreme rather than challenging them .
Argumentative	 eli pariser author of a book called the filter bubble argues that the internet forces us to consume a very narrow range of views as search engines have been personalised with the intention of letting users find what they like so two people searching for the same thing on google can get very different results , for example when googling ` bp ' during the oil spill one person might be directed to information about the spill and its environmental consequences while another might get just investment information .
Argumentative	 when this kind of filtering is added to people constantly interacting with extremists and on websites praise and incite terrorism it is clear that users of these sites will get caught in a confirmation bias and conformation bias tends to lead to people becoming more polarised .
Argumentative	 it is therefore the right policy to punish users of extremist websites before they become too radicalised as it is only a very short step from believing an attack is praiseworthy to carrying out similar attacks .
Argumentative	 regardless of whether as sarkozy claims mohammed merah would himself have been stopped earlier had this law been in place at the time this law will catch some terrorists in the future and stop them before they can do large amounts of harm .
Argumentative	 punishing users of extremist websites will mean that the government can stop those who are on a path to radicalisation through their access to the internet and as a result this will help neutralise a key tool used by extremists to radicalise others .
Argumentative	 there have already been examples of people being inspired to carry out violent jihad through material online such as roshonara choudhry who after watching some of anwar al awlaki 's sermons online attempted to murder labour mp stephen timms .
Argumentative	 this kind of legislation would mean that he could be punished for the lesser crime thereby preventing him from being able to engage in much more damaging criminal activities .
Argumentative	 simply put if extremists are behind bars they are not engaging in terrorist attacks that could kill many people .
