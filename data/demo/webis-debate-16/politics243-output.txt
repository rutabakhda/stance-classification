Non-Argumentative	should women be allowed to serve in combat roles in the armed forces?
Non-Argumentative	 combat roles are usually defined as “roles whose primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy”.
Non-Argumentative	  examples are infantryman, tank crew member and combat pilot.
Non-Argumentative	the military roles open to women vary around the world.
Non-Argumentative	 legislative changes in the past few decades have allowed women to serve in all military roles in many western countries (such as canada, new zealand, sweden, norway, ireland, denmark, germany, finland and the netherlands).
Non-Argumentative	 most other western countries allow women to serve in a variety of roles but not in combat.
Non-Argumentative	 examples are the u.s. (united states) and u.k. (united kingdom).
Non-Argumentative	 nevertheless, the roles of women in the british and american militaries have been gradually increased.
Non-Argumentative	 the rand corporation studied increased deployment of women in all three branches of the united states military throughout the 1990s.
Non-Argumentative	 they wholeheartedly endorsed further integration, having found no great ill effects from expanding the roles of women in the different services over that period.
Non-Argumentative	 in 2002, the british ministry of defense reviewed whether to open combat roles to women and decided against it, while the service of american women in iraq and afghanistan wars has led to a renewed debate about opening combat roles to women in the u.s. military.
Non-Argumentative	during the twentieth century, equal opportunity laws have made it possible for women to work in many fields which were once exclusively male.
Non-Argumentative	 in many western countries, the military is now one of the very few parts of society to formally discriminate against women.
Non-Argumentative	 meanwhile, the number and nature of conflicts in the world have changed over the past century.
Non-Argumentative	since the end of the cold war, wars have become “less frequent and less deadly”.
Non-Argumentative	 in the past, wars were often fought between large armies with heavy weaponry, but many modern conflicts are l.i.c.s (low intensity conflicts), involving terrorist groups with guerilla tactics.
Non-Argumentative	 l.i.c. has been defined by the u.s. military as “... a political-military confrontation between contending states or groups below conventional war and above the routine, peaceful competition among states.
Non-Argumentative	 it frequently involves protracted struggles of competing principles and ideologies... it is waged by a combination of means, employing political, economic, informational, and military instruments.”
Non-Argumentative	 modern war has gained an intensity and geopolitical significance.
Non-Argumentative	 terrorists’ threats prompt the invasion of countries, while struggles for democracy often attract allied intervention.
Non-Argumentative	 an example is the n.a.t.o. (north atlantic treaty organization) involvement in the libyan civil war of 2011.
Non-Argumentative	interventions by western allied groups have increased, while young people in these countries are used to educational and economic opportunities that have largely removed their incentives to enlist.
Non-Argumentative	 since the cold war, most of these countries have ended conscription (with exceptions such as israel and russia), relying instead on a.v.f.s (all volunteer forces).
Non-Argumentative	 both these developments place pressure on recruitment.
Argumentative	 militaries can use ` gender-blind ' recruitment and training processes , treating all candidates the same regardless of gender .
Argumentative	 this is% fair and some women will certainly succeed in entering combatant roles and will prove themselves the equal or better than the men .
Argumentative	 for example , several soviet women have distinguished themselves as snipers and combat aviators .
Argumentative	 alternatively , militaries can calibrate recruitment and training to suit female candidates .
Argumentative	 there is a precedent for this in the u.s. military 's a.p.f.t. , army physical fitness test , which has variations for age .
Argumentative	 if the test standards can be lowered for older men , they can also be lowered for women .
Argumentative	 in the modern high technology battlefield , technical expertise and decision-making skills are often more valuable than physical strength .
Argumentative	 for example , in the american army , performance targets are regularly calibrated for age and position .
Argumentative	 a forty year-old senior n.c.o. , non-commissioned officer , faces a much easier set of targets than hisyear-old subordinate , yet both are deployed in an active combat role .
Argumentative	 modern warfare involves many l.i.c.s , where the battleground is as much `` hearts and minds '' as it is physical combat .
Argumentative	 in a conflict where hearts and minds are important delicate handling of local people is required in order gain their support .
Argumentative	 in l.i.c.s , women are often better suited to intelligence gathering , medical assistance , policing and mediation than men .
Argumentative	 they are often perceived as less threatening and more understanding .
Argumentative	 in addition , they would be better placed to deal with women in the local population .
Argumentative	 for example , the job of many of the female u.s. marines killed and injured in junein iraq was to search women for explosives at checkpoints to avoid the near-universal sense of humiliation engendered by a member of the opposite sex conducting an intimate bodily search .
Argumentative	 volunteer military forces face low recruitment and retention rates as a result of it being a tough and stressful job where workers can not work for as long as they do in many civilian jobs .
Argumentative	 injuries and trauma caused by fighting also add to the turnover rate of soldiers .
Argumentative	 as a result it is necessary to widen the applicant pool in order to be able to ensure there are more candidates for the army .
Argumentative	 allowing women to serve in combat effectively doubles the possible talent pool available for the military to recruit for delicate and sensitive jobs which require interpersonal skills that not every soldier possesses .
Argumentative	 the result will be better and more diplomatic soldiers who will be particularly useful in l.i.c.s. many modern conflicts are l.i.c.s which involve terrorist groups using guerilla tactics .
Argumentative	 in these situations , there are no clear ` front-lines ' , and no clear difference between combatant and non-combatant roles .
Argumentative	 all women serving in the military are exposed to `` front-line risks '' .
Argumentative	 attacks on soldiers are as likely to occur on the military 's bases themselves as they are when the soldiers are out on patrol .
Argumentative	 for example , in late june ofin iraq , two women marines were killed and about a dozen injured in a pair of suicide attacks .
Argumentative	 that frontline combat operations are not always much more dangerous than other roles can be shown by the casualties in iraq comparing the initial invasion and reconstruction phases .
Argumentative	 the united states lost very few casualties in the invasion phase of the war up to president bush 's declaration of victory onmaywith onlydead , compared to an overall death toll of.
Argumentative	 if men and women are already in practice facing the same risks and as women and men are equal , there should be equality when it comes to being considered being in frontline combat service .
Argumentative	 there is a fundamental principle that men and women should be considered equal in all walks of life ; and as such should both have an equal role in the military , including being in combat .
Argumentative	 not allowing combat roles for women has an unfortunate side effect of increasing inequality in terms of ranks .
Argumentative	 combat duty is necessary or highly beneficial for promotion to senior officer positions in many armies .
Argumentative	 if women can not serve in combat , very few will ever reach the highest ranks of the military ; this creates a glass ceiling that will be very hard to break without this change to allowing women to serve in combat .
Argumentative	 women have to be given the same opportunities as men , in the army in order to have the same opportunities they have to be exposed to the same risks .
