Non-Argumentative	this is an idea that has been floated by some education reform advocates (mainly conservatives) who believe that the problem of childhood discipline in the classroom cannot be remedied unless parents themselves are acting at home to engender good disciplinary habits in their children.
Non-Argumentative	  the idea was briefly enacted in both florida and michigan.
Non-Argumentative	  in florida small fines were imposed on parents and in michigan coveted parking permits were suspended when children misbehaved.
Non-Argumentative	  both programs were promptly discontinued due to parental outcry.
Non-Argumentative	 in the united kingdom there have been cases of parents being jailed for failing to stop their children being truant from school.
Non-Argumentative	future iterations of this idea in the united states may involve charter schools where parents of children with track records of disciplinary problems voluntarily enrol their children in a school with such a contract.
Non-Argumentative	  charter schools can state explicit requirements of students in terms of behaviour in their charter which can then be legally enforced.
Non-Argumentative	 modelling the debate in this fashion may help avoid some of the parental consent issues of the debate, although it is by no means necessary for proposition to take this strategy in the debate.
Non-Argumentative	 another version of this debate is to hold parents liable for the criminal actions of children during school going years.
Non-Argumentative	  for instance, if a child is caught shop lifting, one might impose a fine on the parents in addition to punishment handed down to the child.
Non-Argumentative	  some of the arguments below are tailored more specifically to this version of the debate, although the arguments considered can be modified to fit into either debate.
Non-Argumentative	  the assumption behind this brief is that by and large the children being discussed are those with chronic discipline problems.
Argumentative	  addressing the behavioural problems of children requires active parental participation .
Argumentative	 however , in many cases , parents are either not fully aware of their children 's problems , or more importantly , delay the active disciplining of their children .
Argumentative	 this is critical , as for the cycle of negative and positive reinforcement to be effective in behaviour modification , there must be a temporal link between misbehaviour and any potential punishment .
Argumentative	 in a desire to avoid future fines , or whatever the penalty the parents face , there is an active incentive to not only intervene in the child 's misbehaviour , but also to do so in a timely way , which is the most proven way to change children 's behaviour .
Argumentative	 moreover , if there is any tendency for parents to overlook or avoid the problems of chronically unruly children , this serves as an impetus for keeping up with discipline notices and paying attention to the child 's infractions .
Argumentative	 a lack of parental involvement has for example regularly been cited as being partially to blame for the riots in the uk during august.
Argumentative	 in order for a child 's misbehaviour to be successfully remedied , the child must receive a consistent message on what is appropriate both at home and at school .
Argumentative	 in many instances parents may condone behaviour that schools and teacher find unacceptable .
Argumentative	 in other instances , professionals at schools can aid parents in targeting specific behaviours to work on in a specific order in a program that integrates the child 's behaviour at both school and home .
Argumentative	 moreover , uniform and consistent rewards and negative reinforcements from school and home are tremendously useful for helping rehabilitate a child 's behaviour .
Argumentative	 when initiating such programs , the major problem is often that the parents give in and do not adhere to the agreed upon program , which serves to teach the child that unacceptable behaviour is sometimes condonable .
Argumentative	 it 's understandable that parents , who must be with the children a majority of the time , sometimes may find it easier to simply give in and pacify the child and inadvertently award destructive behaviour .
Argumentative	 therefore , a system of parental investment , as proposed here , will ensure that the parents have something riding on sticking to a disciplinary program as well , which ultimately aids the child .
Argumentative	 in the case of parents being penalized for criminal offenses by children , one can modify this argument to fit by noting that often juvenile facilities will use schools as part of a behavioural modification program , therefore the consistency noted above is still critical .
Argumentative	 often , children who have been trapped in a cycle of lack of discipline and disciplinary problems tend not to care about their punishment .
Argumentative	 detention may be seen as a welcome respite from classes , and other punishments over time may cease to make an impression on the child .
Argumentative	 after all , there is only so much that an institution can do to discipline a child .
Argumentative	 using this mechanism opens up a far more effective repertoire of discipline .
Argumentative	 more importantly , while the child may cease to regard any punishments handed down on him or her , often there will still be a desire to avoid actively harming the parents , which occurs under this system .
Argumentative	 the argument also extends in the case of criminal punishments .
Argumentative	 in the psychology of a child , he or she may not fully internalize the effects on their future a shoplifting arrest may have .
Argumentative	 however , the thought of their parents being punished in such an offense may lead to the deterrence necessary to prevent such actions .
Argumentative	 in effect , the argument is that when punishments to the child him or herself fail to act as a deterrent , the child seeing punishments imposed on the parents as a result of his or her actions may reinvigorate the deterrent effect .
Argumentative	 in addition , this allows an extra tool in the teacher 's arsenal , and the mere thought of perhaps `` triggering '' a parental punishment may help bring some children into line .
Argumentative	 in most cases , in which the child is not subject to some sort of constitutional problem , genetic condition or otherwise , the disruptive behaviour of a child is a reflection of in adequate parental intervention over time .
Argumentative	 a normal child under normal circumstances should be expected to conform to behavioural expectations , and the failure to do so represents a partial inadequate job by the parents .
Argumentative	 the result is a cost that is transmitted to society .
Argumentative	 children that are disruptive in school or in society via the criminal justice system cost the system extra money either in school resources and time or judicial-police resources as well as in the more obvious costs such as fixing vandalism and graffiti .
Argumentative	 even worse ; if a student drops out as a result of his discipline problems the cost to society has been estimated as $ 232,000-388 ,000 .
Argumentative	 given that the parent is in part to blame for failing to control the child 's behaviour , in the time during which the parent is the primary custodian of the child , it is fair to pass on a measure of this cost to the parent .
