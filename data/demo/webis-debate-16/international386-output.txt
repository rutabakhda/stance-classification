Non-Argumentative	while the israeli-palestinian conflict has many components, the struggle for land is at its centre, and therefore the legitimacy or lack thereof of israeli settlements in the west bank has become symbolic of the conflict.
Non-Argumentative	to the palestinians, the israeli settlements represent the slow erosion of their national claims occurring in front of their eyes.
Non-Argumentative	 even if some smaller settlements are removed in a final peace agreement, many palestinians are sceptical that the larger ones will ever be removed.
Non-Argumentative	 a number of israeli politicians share that view, and while the original argument for the creation of settlements in the late 1970s was one of security, many israeli far-right politicians such as avigador lieberman now admit that the goal of further construction is to alter the “facts on the ground.”
Non-Argumentative	equally importantly however, the settlement issue is increasingly seen as a measure of the ability and willingness of the united states government to buck israel publicly.
Argumentative	 president obama has been lambasted by republicans for his stand calling for a halt to settlement construction – president george hw bush, who actually cancelled a major loan to israel over the issue faced a rebellion within his own party, and believed that the backlash helped to cost him re-election in 1992.
Argumentative	the settlements , constructed on land that is neither recognizably israel 's nor which israel has even claimed to annex are illegal , encroaching on the territory of a future palestinian state .
Argumentative	 it is absurd for the international community to demand the creation of a palestinian state in the west bank , and yet allow israel to establish its population on that land in settlements that view themselves and are viewed by israel as israeli territory .
Argumentative	 furthermore , their continued expansion is something that each and every palestinian can see every day .
Argumentative	 as a result , the continued expansion both :.
Argumentative	 destroys palestinian confidence in the ability and willingness of the international community to enforce its own promises , especially after repeated american and european promises to stop their construction .
Argumentative	 2 .
Argumentative	 convinces palestinian opinion that the negotiating process is an israeli game to buy time until they have changed the facts on the ground .
Argumentative	 as a consequence of these two factors , the continued expansion of settlements has an impact in driving palestinians towards violent resistance even beyond the direct impact of the settlement construction by undermining their faith in international law , and by adding a sense of urgency to their grievances .
Argumentative	 whether deliberate or not , the settlements are changing the `` facts on the ground '' by changing the political calculus for future israeli governments .
Argumentative	 while most israeli politicians accept the need to abandon some smaller settlements , the vast majority are unlikely to be evacuated .
Argumentative	 it was politically divisive to the point of breaking the likud party in two when ariel sharon , a man with more credit than anyone else on the israeli right pulled out of gaza in, and there were only a little overisraeli settlers there .
Argumentative	 by contrast there are now more than 300,000 settlers in the west bank , and this number is rising fast .
Argumentative	 there were less than 200,000 in.
Argumentative	 of these settlers , many are religious and vote for the haridam , orthodox , parties like the national religious party .
Argumentative	 because the party has served in governments of both the left and the right in recent years , in practice they and the ultra-nationalist israel beitinu tend to hold the balance of power in the israeli knesset .
Argumentative	 therefore every time israel expands settlements , they are reducing their room to manoeuvre in future peace negotiations , and forcing themselves to take a harder stance .
Argumentative	 this means that peace will either become less likely , because israel will set more extreme terms , or that israel will face more internal divisions in order to offer it .
Argumentative	 in either case , as the settlements expand as important as the existence of the settlements themselves is their continued growth .
Argumentative	 the very fact that israel has continued to ostensibly negotiate for the independence of a palestinian state in the west bank on one hand while rapidly expanding the population and the size of israeli settlements can be interpreted as a sign of bad faith .
Argumentative	 for one thing , it raises questions of the seriousness with which israel is attempting to reach an agreement .
Argumentative	 even if the programs of settlement expansion are intended as a temporary policy in lieu of a settlement , the very fact that israel 's plan b is arguably as popular as peace , and being pursued with far more vigour could lead many palestinians to conclude that israel is attempting to run out the clock .
Argumentative	 the consequences of this are inauspicious for the peace process .
Argumentative	 as palestinian faith in the prospect of peaceful negotiations falters , groups like hamas are likely to find an increasingly receptive audience for their view that only force will compel israel to negotiate seriously .
Argumentative	 this in turn will make compromise all the more difficult to achieve .
Argumentative	 the settlements themselves are self-perpetuating in a manner that makes them pernicious to the rights and very existence of neighbouring palestinian communities .
Argumentative	 for one thing , a settlement can not function in isolation .
Argumentative	 it needs a road for its residents to safely travel to and from work in israel .
Argumentative	 security needs subsequently require that this road be protected from attacks by creating a large military presence along its route , and in many cases moving existing palestinian settlements .
Argumentative	 at the very least palestinian areas are bisected by impassable thoroughfares .
Argumentative	 in turn settlements require their fields to be protected by high walls and electric fences to protect them from attack , and the construction crews building them also require protection .
Argumentative	 the result is that even a settlement of a few hundred families rapidly requires the takeover of an amount of land out of all proportion to the actual number of settlers involved , and any further expansion compounds the problem .
Argumentative	 the security needs of settlements create a situation which makes the livelihood of palestinians impossible .
Argumentative	 the existence of the settlements makes these security policies a necessity .
Argumentative	 as a consequence , the only clear solution is the removal of the settlements .
