Non-Argumentative	in the 1990s the world band and the imf demanded that developing countries follow structural adjustment programmes to make their economies more market orientated.
Non-Argumentative	 the resulting change to free market policy brought about changes in the labour market - changes in terms of who is involved in the labour force, what type of employment individuals are able to access, and the degree of risk associated with jobs.
Non-Argumentative	 loans were made conditional on the implementation of structural adjustment programs (saps)  encouraging neoliberalism, flexibilisation, and a decentralisation in control over the economy.
Non-Argumentative	 conditions applied affected the lives of inhabitants both in urban and rural economies.
Non-Argumentative	 today africa’s labour force is continuing to change following the economic crisis.
Non-Argumentative	a feminisation of labour has been occurred in both periodic events.
Non-Argumentative	 a ‘feminising’ labour force can be referred to in two aspects: firstly, an increase in the number of women being incorporated into paid work.
Non-Argumentative	 secondly, ‘feminisation’ refers to the increasing flexibilisation of work for both men and women.
Non-Argumentative	 a shift in the nature of employment is found, with a rise in informal employment and irregular conditions of work.
Non-Argumentative	 the feminisation of the labour force therefore means changes in the structure of who is employed and the structure of jobs available.
Non-Argumentative	this focuses on labour force participation and empowerment.
Non-Argumentative	 the world development report (2013) argued jobs are key to development - more jobs are needed and focus should be on getting employment.
Non-Argumentative	 however, by exploring the picture of female employment and jobs, does work provide empowerment - who is empowered; what kind of empowerment; and fundamentally, how long for?
Non-Argumentative	 will the convergence, and continued inclusion of women, in employment mean gender differences will disappear in africa’s labour market and society?
Non-Argumentative	 finally, with women seen to be able to pioneer national development and gdp growth (i.e. barsh and lee, 2011) should we be encouraging more women to enter the labour force?
Argumentative	 jobs are empowerment .
Argumentative	 building sustainable livelihoods , and tackling poverty in the long term , requires enabling access to capital assets .
Argumentative	 a key asset is financial capital .
Argumentative	 jobs , and employment , provide a means to access and build financial capital required , whether through loans or wages .
Argumentative	 when a woman is able to work she is therefore able to take control of her own life .
Argumentative	 additionally she may provide a second wage meaning the burden of poverty on households is cumulatively reduced .
Argumentative	 having a job and the financial security it brings means that other benefits can be realised such as investing in good healthcare and education , women working from home in kenya , designing jewellery , shows the link between employment and earning an income .
Argumentative	 the women have been empowered to improve their way of life .
Argumentative	 unemployment has been linked to several health and wellbeing effects .
Argumentative	 firstly , the psychological impact of unemployment involve a range of issues - from confidence to mental well-being .
Argumentative	 issues of mental health problems - such as depression , suicide , anxiety , and substance abuse , need recognition in africa .
Argumentative	 the impact of mental health may not only be on the individual , but dispersed within families and across generations .
Argumentative	 secondly , unemployment may result in a loss of social networks and networking skills .
Argumentative	 the power of social capital , or networks , in reducing vulnerability has been widely noted .
Argumentative	 therefore encouraging women to participate within the labour market ensures new networks are built and retained through the vital communication skills used .
Argumentative	 finally .
Argumentative	 unemployment may affect physical health status .
Argumentative	 unemployment may place individuals in a downward spiral , making it harder to re-enter the job market .
Argumentative	 labour participation enables an awareness , and acquirement , of equal gender rights .
Argumentative	 firstly , labour participation is challenging cultural ideologies and norms of which see the woman 's responsibility as limited to the reproductive sphere .
Argumentative	 entering the productive sphere brings women equal work rights and the right to enter public space .
Argumentative	 by such a change gender norms of the male breadwinner are challenged .
Argumentative	 secondly , labour force participation by women has resulted in the emergence of community lawyers and organisations to represent them .
Argumentative	 the declaration of the african regional domestic workers network is a case in point .
Argumentative	 with the rising number of female domestic workers , the network is working to change conditions - upholding conferences , sharing information , and taking action .
