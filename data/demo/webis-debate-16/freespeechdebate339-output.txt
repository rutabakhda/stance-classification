Non-Argumentative	free speech is a fundamental human right; everyone, everywhere has an inalienable right to give their opinions.
Non-Argumentative	 today the internet is the frontier where free speech and state attempts to control it collide.
Non-Argumentative	 as the internet is this frontier there are today questions of whether internet access may be a human right and whether states that are considered free should attempt to defend the principle of internet freedom against illegitimate encroachments in non-democratic countries.
Non-Argumentative	for a time the internet was the only uncensored outlet for criticism of governments that have the traditional media under their thumb however this rapidly changed as authoritarian governments recognised that to stay in power they need to control the internet.
Non-Argumentative	 many non-democratic regimes, as well as a few democratic ones, engage in censorship particularly over internal news relating to that country.
Non-Argumentative	 china’s ‘great firewall’ is the most notorious censorship system and employs forty thousand internet police to monitor the country’s millions of web users.
Non-Argumentative	 however many more countries have some form of censorship in operation, much of this involving blocking content that is perceived as being against the sitting government.anti-government protests in burma inand in iran during its“green revolution” showed the importance of the internet to protest movements with social media being used to get information out to the rest of the world as well as to organise protests.
Non-Argumentative	 even major news outlets and foreign diplomats gained much of their information on the protests from social networks.
Non-Argumentative	 attempts by these two governments to cut the flow of information and shut the internet down during these protests also stimulated efforts to develop tools to help protestors bypass government’s censorship efforts.
Non-Argumentative	 for example there was widespread coverage of a program called haystack that was created to provide a secure route to anonomise users identities and so provide a safe way to communicate with the world.
Non-Argumentative	 while haystack unfortunately did not work it did provide impetus to the idea that the response from the international community to human rights violations could in part be technological.
Non-Argumentative	 countries such as the united states and united kingdom are increasingly using their aid budgets to help freedom of expression on the internet.
Non-Argumentative	 in aprilwilliam hague, british foreign secretary, promised an additional £1.5 million specifically for this purpose.
Non-Argumentative	   “the second free speech debate principle is “we defend the internet and all other forms of communication against illegitimate encroachments by both public and private powers.”
Non-Argumentative	 leads to the question of how we defend the internet.
Non-Argumentative	 one of the options to defend freedom on the internet is creating software to help evade censorship so keeping the internet open to all.
Non-Argumentative	 human rights are a bread and butter issue for foreign aid and the internet is now one of the key battle grounds for freedom of speech.
Non-Argumentative	 activists are unlikely to be able to match their states on their own; foreign aid can help redress the balance.”
Argumentative	 - alex helling articleof the universal declaration of human rights defines freedom of speech as `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . ''
Argumentative	 it is something innate in humans to have opinions and to want to express them to others and within a few limits governments have a duty to allow this freedom of expression .
Argumentative	 where governments are not allowing this freedom of information this affects not only those whose opinions are being suppressed but those who can not hear their opinions .
Argumentative	 the right to the freedom to receive and seek this information is just as important as the right to voice these opinions .
Argumentative	 moreover as stated in articlethis is `` regardless of frontiers '' ; those outside a country have just as much right to hear these opinions as those inside .
Argumentative	 government aid programs from democracies in western europe and america are already concerned with promoting human rights including freedom of speech .
Argumentative	 australia 's aid program for example has a human rights fund of $ 6.5 million per year that provides grants to among other things `` educate and/or train human rights victims , workers or defenders '' .
Argumentative	 enabling victims of human rights abuse to get around their government 's censorship is the obvious next step .
Argumentative	 the concept of the ` responsibility to protect ' introduced by the international commission on intervention and state sovereignty inprovided that when governments were unable or unwilling to protect their own citizens then that responsibility devolves to the international community and may ultimately lead to military action for particularly gross violations .
Argumentative	 this responsibility to react should be `` with appropriate measures '' and for the breach of the human right of freedom of expression providing a method to enable those whose freedom of expression/speech is being violated to exercise this right is the most appropriate and proportional response .
Argumentative	 if democracies are to provide money to help dissidents then this option of funding research into and distributing software to defeat censors is the easiest way in which to help these dissidents .
Argumentative	 those who are trying to exercise their freedom of speech do not want help in the form of military intervention or diplomatic representations rather they want to have the space and capacity to exercise those freedoms .
Argumentative	 the internet means that for the first time it is possible for external actors to provide that platform for freedom of speech without having to take those who wish to exercise these freedoms outside of the country that is violating those freedoms .
Argumentative	 the internet is very important in the economies of many authoritarian regimes .
Argumentative	 in china for example there aremillion online shoppers and the e-commerce market is worth almost $billion and could be worth over $billion by.
Argumentative	 as a result authoritarian regimes ca n't easily just turn off the internet and ignore it so long as they want their economy to operate .
Argumentative	 as a result except in extreme cases such as north korea or for particularly prominent dissidents who are locked up physical access to the internet is unlikely to be denied .
Argumentative	 so long as there is physical access to the internet it will be possible to help by providing ways to avoid firewalls so that they can access information their state has banned and express opinions to both the outside world and their compatriots .
Argumentative	 it is equally important to provide ways for these people to avoid being tracked by the authorities so as to prevent retaliation against them for evading censorship .
Argumentative	 while haystack was a failure there have been other projects that are receiving state department funding that may be more successful such as ` intheclear ' which provides a `` panic button '' app for smart phones allowing contents to be quickly erased and prewritten texts sent so having the dual effect of making it more difficult for those making the arrest to find out what the user was doing and raising the alarm that this person has been arrested .
Argumentative	 this technology helps meet a clear need ; egyptian democracy activists when asked what kind of technology they needed most said they wanted safer cellphones .
Argumentative	 most government aid budgets are small and have numerous other important calls on their resources such as development aid .
Argumentative	 betweenandthe united states congress funded the effort against internet censorship with $million .
Argumentative	 while this may sound like a lot compared to the $million of aid to liberia and $million to unicef init is not a large commitment .
Argumentative	 yet due to the nature of the internet small investments can have immense benefits .
Argumentative	 money spent on food aid will buy enough food to feed a limited amount of people yet if a technology is developed that allows internet users to get around censors and not be tracked then hundreds of millions would benefit .
Argumentative	 it would at the same time have the incalculable benefit of making it more difficult for authorities to track and crack down on those who are breaking the authorities ' censorship .
