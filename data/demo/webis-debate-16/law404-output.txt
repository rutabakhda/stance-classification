Non-Argumentative	traditionally, heads of states, and other state officials, have enjoyed some form of immunity from prosecution.
Non-Argumentative	 immunity can be divided up in to two types – functional immunity, which is immunity for official actions, and personal immunity, which is attached to the individual.
Non-Argumentative	 head of state immunity typically falls under functional immunity.
Non-Argumentative	 personal immunity typically applies to individuals such as diplomats (diplomatic immunity is outlined in the vienna convention on diplomatic relations).
Non-Argumentative	 this is focused on both of these forms of immunity when applied to political figures.
Non-Argumentative	in 2002, the international court of justice, a un body entirely unrelated to the international criminal court, confirmed the existence of state immunity as a part of customary international law, in a case concerning a belgian arrest warrant for the dr congolese foreign minister, who was alleged to have incited genocide, which was issued under a belgian universal jurisdiction law that allowed the belgian courts to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, even if they are outside belgium.
Non-Argumentative	the issue was put to the test regarding the situation of the later life of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet.
Non-Argumentative	 following the ousting of democratically elected president salvador allende in a military coup pinochet lead a military junta that, during hisyear cia backed rule, committed a significant number of large scale human rights abuses.
Non-Argumentative	  due to immunity that was created by the succeeding chilean government, he was not prosecuted there; however he was indicted in spain under universal jurisdiction inwhile he was in the united kingdom for medical treatment.
Non-Argumentative	the issue of head of state immunity lead to a battle over the possibility of his extradition in the british courts, going to its highest  court three times – first on the issue of whether he was immune from prosecution in spain, secondly on an issue of bias (one of the original judges, leonard hoffmann, had failed to  disclose that he was an unpaid director of the charitable wing of amnesty international), and a third, on the same issue as the first, after the unprecedented setting aside of the initial decision.
Non-Argumentative	 eventually, the appellate committee of the house of lords (a de facto court, rather than an arm of the legislature, since fully spun off in to the supreme court of the united kingdom) ruled that he did not have head of state immunity for some, but not all, of the charges, and allowed the home secretary to authorize his extradition.
Non-Argumentative	 the original decision in pinochet i was that torture cannot be a state function, negating functional head of state immunity.
Non-Argumentative	 the decision in the third case was that he was not immune due to the torture convention, rather than anything in customary international law.
Non-Argumentative	 eventually pinochet’s extradition was vetoed by home secretary jack straw, he returned to chile, where he was indicted, but died before he could be tried.
Non-Argumentative	international tribunals have typically rejected all forms of head of state immunity, rome statute articlemakes “official capacity” irrelevant in the work of the icc, following on from similar positions in the icty and ictr.
Non-Argumentative	 these courts have repeatedly made determinations that state immunity does not apply at international tribunals, most recently done so by the special court for sierra leone, in the case of charles taylor.
Non-Argumentative	the issue of the trial of serving heads of state has resurfaced following the indictment of uhuru kenyatta, current president of kenya, for his alleged role in violence after theelection.
Non-Argumentative	 kenyatta, who was elected after the indictment, is still operating as president of kenya (a fellow defendant in a separate trial, william ruto, is deputy president).
Non-Argumentative	 this issue has been made more complex due to the shooting by al-shabab linked gunmen at the westgate shopping centre, with kenyatta having to lead the response to the attacks while preparing to defend himself at the hague.
Non-Argumentative	 kenyatta’s trial is, at the time of writing, due to start on the 12th of november 2013, but he will not need to be present for all of the trial.
Argumentative	 international diplomacy involves visits by both diplomats and government figures to other states .
Argumentative	 this can even include states where relations are tense or even hostile .
Argumentative	 india and pakistan , who have a very tense relationship and share one of the most fortified borders in the world , the line of control that divides kashmir , have embassies in each other .
Argumentative	 even throughout the cold war , the usa and soviet union had a full and normal diplomatic relations .
Argumentative	 just as diplomatic immunity prevents politically motivated arrests of diplomats , head of state immunity is necessary to `` grease the wheels '' of international diplomacy to allow international summits to take place without campaigns for the arrest and trial before domestic courts of foreign politicians .
Argumentative	 if a head of state were to be arrested for trial before a foreign domestic court , it would cause immense damage to diplomatic relations between those two countries , russia recently got into a row over the arrest of one of its diplomats in the netherlands .
Argumentative	 the diplomat was quickly released but russia still demanded the ` guilty parties ' be punished .
Argumentative	 the reaction to the arrest of a head of state or government would be much greater and would likely mean the breaking of diplomatic ties .
Argumentative	 leaders would be much less willing to visit the country where the arrest occurred in the future for fear it would happen to them and would damage the world diplomatic system by challenging the idea of diplomatic immunity .
Argumentative	 heads of state and senior politicians are targets for political stunts .
Argumentative	 this could be seeking to get a political opponent locked up so as to benefit from the removal of an opponent .
Argumentative	 alternatively it may be as part of a publicity stunt to highlight their own issue of concern or organisation .
Argumentative	 in both cases the trial does not need to convict as the figure being in a trial will be enough to damage them and provide publicity .
Argumentative	 in, following a request by supporters of palestine , an arrest warrant was sought at westminster magistrates ' court for the arrest of tzipi livni , who was foreign minister of israel during israel 's 2008-2009 invasion of the gaza strip , also known as operation cast lead .
Argumentative	 at the time of the attempted arrest livni was no longer in office but the action was clearly a stunt .
Argumentative	 livni was not arrested in the end , because she cancelled her trip to the uk , and the warrant was dropped by the director of public prosecutions , kier starmer .
Argumentative	 however , a needless diplomatic incident was still caused .
Argumentative	 sometimes people will do bad things in order to achieve good and necessary results .
Argumentative	 for example , the allied bombing campaigns in the second world war would be highly likely to amount to a war crime under the rome statute if they were done today .
Argumentative	 they were indiscriminate , they targeted civilians , and additionally even at the time were recognised as having little military value .
Argumentative	 instead the idea was to terrorise the civilian population .
Argumentative	 yet they were considered to be necessary as showing the allies were doing something to aid the soviet union .
Argumentative	 the same might be the case with the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki , they clearly targeted civilians , yet if they helped end the war without a ground invasion of japan then this war crime might have been for the greater good .
Argumentative	 head of state immunity allows individuals to take unpopular and difficult decisions that are necessary for a greater good in government without fear of prosecution for their actions .
Argumentative	 we need our leaders to be able to take decisions based on the national interest , not based upon their concern for their life after office .
