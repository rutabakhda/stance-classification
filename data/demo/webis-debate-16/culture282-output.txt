Non-Argumentative	violence against women is one of the most widespread human rights abuses affecting the world today.
Non-Argumentative	 every day, thousands of women and girls are abused and murdered by their families, raped in armed conflicts and attacked for defending woman's rights1.
Non-Argumentative	 many believe there are still violent undercurrents, such as the depiction of violence towards women in some music, which have not allowed women to be truly free from detrimental social norms.
Non-Argumentative	 simply stating that vaw (violence against women) is wrong and dealing with situations one by one as they occur is no longer an option as it is such a widespread phenomenon.
Non-Argumentative	 violence against women in music is now a global phenomenon, and is common in many of the world's most famous artists.
Non-Argumentative	 the problem has become even more widespread thanks to the advancements in technology, and in particular the internet which allows the access and sharing of this style of music all over the world.
Non-Argumentative	 while in most countries films (and to an extent tv shows) are given age ratings such as universal, 12a or r in order to suggest what age group are mature enough to deal with its content, however, so far such a rating system has not been created for music, meaning people of all ages are exposed to many violent images they would not have access to via other forms of media.2 yet music videos depicting violence towards women exist and are often unrated, such as eminem and rhianna's 'love the way you lie'1.
Non-Argumentative	 this, combined with the ever increasing use of the internet to obtain and share music, shows that there are inconsistencies between the expectations and restrictions put on music and music videos and the expectations and restrictions placed on other forms of media.
Non-Argumentative	 also due to common ownership of mp3 players, radios and computing equipment it is harder than ever to keep track of what music children/ young people are listening too.
Non-Argumentative	 often genres such as rap and hip-hop are blamed for these misogynistic lyrics, but there are a huge range of songs depicted violence against women from rap to rock to county, and in america, france, the uk and many more (see scrapbook for examples).
Non-Argumentative	 the discussion of whether music depicting violence against women should be banned creates a platform so that we can begin to discuss if all music depicting any crimes should be banned.
Non-Argumentative	note: in order to illustrate the examples of violent language towards women in music involves directly quoting from the original source.
Non-Argumentative	 in many cases this means the examples contain strong and violent language that some may find offensive.
Argumentative	 however, it seems necessary to keep this language intact in order to properly quote from the source, and also in order to illustrate the extreme nature of violence towards women that is prevalent in these songs.
Argumentative	while music depicting violence towards women appears on the surface to only demean women , it can be offensive and degrading to a range of people .
Argumentative	 one popular culture reference to a situation like this comes from the british television show called the office , in the episode ` merger '.
Argumentative	 in this episode the character david brent tells a racist joke and while this did not offend the black character present , many other characters were still offended by this joke .
Argumentative	 people may be offended by the ideas behind the music , as it seems that people who glorify violence towards women in song appear to think that this violence is acceptable .
Argumentative	 men could be offended by these ideas just as much as women might .
Argumentative	 as songs like this become ` mainstream ' in some cultures , everybody in that culture becomes affected by it , and some men and women may feel degraded by this association .
Argumentative	 finally some people may argue that the person who writes and/or sings lyric that depict violence towards women degrade themselves in this act .
Argumentative	 music depicting violence to women causes and sustains the cycle of violence .
Argumentative	 the scottish home affairs correspondent lucy adams reported inthe levels of domestic abuse committed by 16-18 year olds grew by around% .
Argumentative	 one of the reasons suggested for this dramatic raise is the culture of music that depicts and glorifies violence towards women , heraldscotland.com .
Argumentative	 journal of personality and social psychology reports that a study conducted in a variety of us states illustrated that music that depicted acts of violence ` led to more aggressive interpretations of ambiguously aggressive words , increased the relative speed with which people read aggressive vs. nonaggressive words ... , the violent songs increased feelings of hostility without provocation or threat ' .
Argumentative	 although they are quick to assure that it is not the music type that has this affect , it is simply the lyrics , as even humorous aggressive songs have this effect .
Argumentative	 they conclude with the idea that ` repeated exposure to violent lyrics may contribute to the development of an aggressive personality ' and thus lead to more aggressive behaviour .
Argumentative	 while currently there is little to no research specifically on the link between domestic violence and lyrics that depict abuse to women , the current information that we have on violence and music lyrics suggests we can expect a similar effect .
Argumentative	 thus if we were to ban music depicting violence towards women , people could not be influenced by it and levels of violence would drop .
Argumentative	 we already give films , dvd 's and games an age appropriate rating .
Argumentative	 in the united states , the motion picture association of america is charged with the responsibility of providing ratings to consumers .
Argumentative	 it would seem that it would be simple to stretch these criteria to a similar music body .
Argumentative	 therefore people would only be subjected to violent lyrics when it is deemed they are old enough to hear or buy this material , and it would stop younger people from being exposed to this kind of music .
Argumentative	 this also means that no new state-run institution needs to be created ; it would operate , like the mpaa , independently of government control .
Argumentative	 as such , claims that any form of music censorship would suffer from practical problems are short-sighted , we simply need to extend the medium that already exists .
Argumentative	 asha jennings began a boycott of misogynistic music in hip-hop , resulting in the ` take back the music ' campaign supported by essence magazine .
Argumentative	 jennings claims that this type of rap / hip hop music is ` telling people , black women , are bitches and hos and sluts and not worthy of respect ... , and that 's exactly how society is treating us '.
Argumentative	 she continues that images of women ` tends to be objectified , degrading , very stripper-like ' or as nagging vicious and manipulative money grabbers1 .
Argumentative	 jennings ' worry is that in these videos women are depicted as menial , subservient and purely as the object of men 's entertainment .
Argumentative	 the lyrics that go with these music videos compound these ideas of women as undeserving of male respect e.g. ` would n't piss on fire to put you out ' , eminem , ` then i straight smoked the ho ... , and she thanked me ' , nwe , all lyrics in full are in the scrapbook .
Argumentative	 these images in themselves are violence towards women , as they dehumanise them .
Argumentative	 as this becomes a dominant image in society , young people who look up to these rappers mimic their behaviour and believe it is ok to disrespect women ,2 as that is what they have been exposed to .
Argumentative	 this works in the same way for young girls , who can not relate to the male rappers and so instead mimic the women they talk about , while also following their views on women .
Argumentative	 this idea that women are not deserving of respect must affect the levels of violence towards women as if you abuse someone you can not fully respect them .
Argumentative	 therefore if music depicting violence , and for this argument , disrespect , towards women was banned , then violence towards women in the real world would be reduced and this must be seen as a good thing .
