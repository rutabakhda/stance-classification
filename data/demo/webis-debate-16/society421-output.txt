Non-Argumentative	sponsoring a child is a popular way of supporting charity work in the developing world - countries where people don’t have much money.
Non-Argumentative	 many charities run schemes which link a person in a more wealthy country (the donor, or sponsor) with a particular child in a developing country.
Non-Argumentative	 the sponsor gives a little bit of money (a donation) every month to support that child, it’s usually between $20 and $40[1].
Non-Argumentative	 some charities focus their sponsorship work on orphans, but most choose children living at home with their families, and the money is often spent by the charity rather than given directly to the child’s family.
Non-Argumentative	 usually the child benefits through education, health care, and perhaps food aid.
Non-Argumentative	 some charities use the sponsored children as a way of assisting a whole community, while others focus more on the individual child and their family.communication is an important part of sponsorship schemes.
Non-Argumentative	 as well as their regular donations, sponsors usually send letters to the child they are supporting, and perhaps occasional gifts.
Non-Argumentative	 in return they can expect to receive regular reports and photographs from the charity about the child’s progress and how their money is making a difference to his or her life.
Non-Argumentative	 often the child is also expected to write to their sponsor, if they are able to do so.
Non-Argumentative	although sponsorship is a major source of funding for charities working overseas, it does have critics.
Non-Argumentative	 most of the largest aid agencies choose not to offer child sponsorship schemes, this discussion looks at why that is, and whether or not sponsorship is a good form of charitable giving.
Argumentative	 over the years $a month , or perhaps even more , adds up to thousands of dollars ' worth of aid spending - this is different to other forms of charity because the main focus here is on `` long-term changes ''  .
Argumentative	 unlike a one-off donation , this method of giving ensures that poor people get support for a long time without costing people too much in one go .
Argumentative	 it also ensures that people keep giving to these needy causes , and makes people realise that they can afford to make a difference .
Argumentative	 personal letters , charity reports , photographs and even visits help to build a bridge between the developed and developing world  .

Argumentative	 this includes drinking water , food , education , medical care , shelter and sanitation - often charitable donations are more specific , they only provide for one of these aspects of life .
Argumentative	 by putting children at the heart of charity programs it is hoped that a stronger foundation will be made for the future - the young people who are helped today can maintain a better lifestyle in the future  .
Argumentative	 giving all this to an individual child also produces more tangible results than giving to a vast organisation , whose work is can often over-ambitious and more open to corruption  .
Argumentative	 unlike most other forms of charity , sponsorship creates a direct link between the person giving money and the person receiving it .
Argumentative	 people are able to see the ways in which their money is helping others , and this makes them feel good about it -- as world vision international says - `` you get to see and feel the difference your support makes ''  .
