Non-Argumentative	the european constitution is an attempt to provide an overall restructuring of the current eu institutional layout in order to deal with important challenges such as continuing eu enlargement, the eu integration process and the increasing role the eu is expected to play in world affairs.
Non-Argumentative	 the first proposition for a constitutional treaty was signed in rome on the 29th october 2004.
Non-Argumentative	 it combines and extends the different treaties on which the eu is currently based and presents it as one document that needs to be ratified by all member states in order to take action.
Non-Argumentative	the treaty document proposes a series of important reforms.
Non-Argumentative	 these include combining the three pillars into which current eu policy is divided, and clarifying in more detail the role of the eu parliament, council and commission, giving almost exclusive legislative initiative and executive power to the commission.
Non-Argumentative	 the constitutional treaty was ratified by national parliaments or referenda in eighteen eu member states, but has been rejected in referenda by two more.
Non-Argumentative	 the ‘no’ votes need not have stopped the ratification process elsewhere, but a constitutional treaty cannot come into effect without the approval of alleu states so in practice the proposed constitution was dead.
Non-Argumentative	the situation with eu law has undergone a major change inwhen the lisbon treaty came in action.
Non-Argumentative	 the lisbon treaty contains many of the changes the constitution attempted to introduce, for example: a politician chosen to be president of the european council for two-and-a-half years; a new post - called high representative - to give the eu more influence on the world stage and others.
Non-Argumentative	 however there are also differences between the constitution and the lisbon treaty, which made the ratification of the treaty a fact.
Non-Argumentative	 on an examination of the text of both documents, it seems that the substance of the lisbon treaty is largely similar to that of, the now defunct, the european constitution in terms of the reforms it institutes.
Non-Argumentative	  however, much of the symbolism of the constitution has not been reproduced in the lisbon treaty.
Non-Argumentative	  more significant perhaps, is the fact that the term “constitution” appears nowhere in the text of the lisbon treaty.
Non-Argumentative	 the lisbon treaty possesses several distinct features which are highly indicative of the fact that it is not a formal constitution as such.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition to its lack of symbolism, the lisbon treaty was not designed to stand alone but rather, merely, to amend the existing treaties.
Non-Argumentative	the current debate will examine whether the eu needs a true constitution other than the lisbon treaty from two aspects.
Non-Argumentative	 it is both a practical debate (does the eu need a constitution?)
Non-Argumentative	 and a more abstract debate (is the eu the kind of entity/organisation that should adopt a constitution?)
Argumentative	 the arguments for and against an eu constitution rest on complicated issues of law, sovereignty, political philosophy and the efficiency and effectiveness of the eu’s institutions and procedures.
Argumentative	a comprehensive reform of the eu institutional layout is a must given the pressures created by the continuing enlargement process as well as the integration process .
Argumentative	 the existing eu architecture worked fine for a community of six states , and even for a group of twelve , but it is now desperately out-dated and unsuitable for a union ofor more .
Argumentative	 for example , the national veto still applies in many areas , meaning one state can block progress even when the otheragree .
Argumentative	 even when agreement is reached , it is often agonisingly slow and difficult to implement across the whole of the union , often having to pass through every parliament .
Argumentative	 as a result eu decision-making has often been criticised as slow , complex and producing too many ` lowest common denominator ' solutions , therefore ireland can bring to a halt a vital treaty like lisbon and the role of the presidency and ` foreign minister ' is a compromise that does not result in more unified policy .
Argumentative	 while still leaving the people feeling distant from the eu 's political processes , undermining legitimacy .
Argumentative	 a constitutional treaty is the only comprehensive tool that exists right now in order to allow for this necessary overall reform .
Argumentative	 the current treaty-basis for the european union is enormous , ambiguous and extremely complicated .
Argumentative	 the existing treaties regulate multiple levels from the constitutional to detailed market regulations .
Argumentative	 as a result of this individuals can not easily read and understand the treaties as a us citizen for example .
Argumentative	 it is difficult to keep track of each new treaty that amends the pre-existing treaties .
Argumentative	 the adoption of a shorter , clearer document will make the eu much more ` user friendly . '
Argumentative	 the eu currently suffers from the fact that many of its citizens do not know what it is or what it does ; eu citizens either do not know where to look for this information or are deterred and intimidated by the size of the treaty of rome and the maastricht treaty .
Argumentative	 having an easily digestible constitution will mean that the eu 's citizens can easily find out what the eu is and what it does .
Argumentative	 since the maastricht treaty , the citizens of eu member states have possessed parallel citizenship of the eu .
Argumentative	 however , european citizens do not identify themselves with the eu in the way that citizens of the usa self-identify as american .
Argumentative	 an important part of the patriotism of americans is ` constitutional patriotism ; ' pride in their constitution and civic institutions .
Argumentative	 the european union aims to bring about ever closer union between the peoples of europe .
Argumentative	 it should foster a shared sense of ` european identity ' by adopting a constitution , in which every citizen of the eu can take pride .
Argumentative	 the european court of justice , ecj , has long treated the founding treaties as the constitutional documents of the european union .
Argumentative	 many commentators have noted the efforts of the ecj to `` constitutionalise '' many principles -- such as the direct effect and supremacy of community law over the domestic laws of member states and the increasing protection of human rights -- the ecj is often overstepping its bounds when it comes to applying and interpreting the treaties .
Argumentative	 the ecj has often been accused of `` judicial activism '' in over-stepping the legitimate boundaries of courts in a democracy .
Argumentative	 by enshrining much of this creative jurisprudence in a democratically ratified constitution , the eu can assert and emphasise its status as a democratic entity , rather than an elite-driven process separate from the citizens of europe .
