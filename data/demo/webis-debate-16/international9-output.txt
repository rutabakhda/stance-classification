Non-Argumentative	the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw) won the nobel prize for peace on the 11th october“for its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons”.
Non-Argumentative	 the nobel prize committee argued “recent events in syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.”
Non-Argumentative	 yet this was only just over a week after the opcw started in its efforts to disarm syria’s chemical weapons, a mission that will almost certainly prove to be the organisation’s biggest test.
Non-Argumentative	 and only a couple of months after the first confirmed chemical weapons attack since the chemical weapons convention came into effect in 1997.
Non-Argumentative	the weapons inspectors are only in syria as a result of a last minute deal between the great powers of russia and the united states as a way to avoid a bombing campaign by the americans and french.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states attempts to create a coalition to bomb syria were already stumbling when secretary of state john kerry in a news conference in london responded to how war could be averted with "[assad] could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week ….
Non-Argumentative	 but he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done."
Non-Argumentative	 the russians took this as an opening to suggest putting syria's chemical weapons under international control which the syrian government quickly accepted with foreign minister walid al-moallem saying "syria welcomes the russian proposal out of concern for the lives of the syrian people, the security of our country and because it believes in the wisdom of the russian leadership that seeks to avert american aggression against our people.
Non-Argumentative	"the result was a framework agreed between russia and the united states on the 14th september whereby syria would agree to the destruction of all chemical agents and related equipment with the monitoring of the opcw.
Non-Argumentative	 a rough timeline was also decided “a. completion of initial opcw on-site inspections by november.
Non-Argumentative	 b. destruction of production and mixing/filling equipment by november.
Non-Argumentative	 c. complete elimination of all chemical weapons material and equipment in the first half of 2014.”
Non-Argumentative	on the same day syria joined the chemical weapons convention, provisionally applying it until its entry into force on the 14th octoberwhich allowed the weapons inspectors to begin their work of first compiling and then destroying syria's stockpile of wmd.
Non-Argumentative	there was an initial deadline for the handover by 6th february.
Non-Argumentative	 this was however not met resulting in negotiations on a new date and a new deadline of the 13th april, a deadline that may well be missed but probably not by much.
Non-Argumentative	 however even if the deadlines are met there will remain questions about whether the inspectors have been beneficial as the war has raged around them.
Non-Argumentative	 and whether assad has really given up all of his weapons of mass destruction.
Argumentative	 the biggest difficulty with the weapons inspectors being in syria is that they are a sideshow to the real problem .
Argumentative	 yes chemical weapons use is horrific but their use in syria has caused far fewer casualties than conventional weapons .
Argumentative	 the syrian observatory for human rights put the total death toll at 115,000 at the end of septemberby comparison the chemical weapons attack that triggered the threat of intervention and therefore the inspections caused somewhere betweenanddeaths .
Argumentative	 syria 's having joined the chemical weapons convention and allowed in inspectors may prevent more deaths as a result of chemical weapons but it has not stopped the conflict .
Argumentative	 many thousands more will die as a result of the conflict while the international community looks on patting itself on the back that it has somehow managed to find a solution .
Argumentative	 chemical weapons are a horrifying weapon of mass destruction but they are by no means the only such horrific weapons .
Argumentative	 james clapper , the u.s. director of national intelligence says `` we judge that some elements of syria 's biological warfare programme might have advanced beyond the research and development stage and might be capable of limited agent production , based on the duration of its longstanding programme '' .
Argumentative	 biological weapons could potentially be even more devastating than chemical weapons as they do n't necessarily affect just a localised area then disperse .
Argumentative	 as with other viruses they can be passed from person to person .
Argumentative	 in a country like syria where the health services have broken down , and basically do n't exist in opposition areas the result could be huge numbers of deaths .
Argumentative	 it is inconsistent to disarm one type of weapon while leaving another type of wmd available to the syrian regime .
Argumentative	 weapons inspectors are unlikely to actually be able to totally disarm syria .
Argumentative	 the opcw has been given a target of dismantling syria 's arsenal by the middle ofbut has admitted that it is a tight deadline that will require temporary ceasefires if the target is to be reached .
Argumentative	 this is because `` for any particular move that the team has to undertake , the security situation is assessed .
Argumentative	 unless we get the clearance from our un colleagues , we do n't move . ''
Argumentative	 clearly if the weapons inspectors wo n't go where there is a high risk to themselves they are unlikely to get the job done .
Argumentative	 already inspectors have encountered situations where they ca n't gain access to sites due to safety concerns .
Argumentative	 moreover in a conflict situation it will be extremely difficult to verify that all of syria 's chemical weapons have been dismantled .
Argumentative	 there are two potential problems -- will the syrian government really be honest about the size of its stockpiles or will it quietly keep some back , and will the inspectors be able to gain access to all areas both government and rebel held ?
Argumentative	 so long as there is conflict there will clearly be a chaotic situation in which weapons could be buried , or hidden , or simply never found .
Argumentative	 yria is falling well behind on handing over its weapons .
Argumentative	 the deadliest chemicals were supposed to be removed by 1st january and the rest by 6th february .
Argumentative	 neither happened .
Argumentative	 the syrian government blamed the lack of protective equipment as well as the security situation but the opcw says it has handed over the necessary equipment .
Argumentative	 under a new timetable syria has pledged to remove all chemical weapons by 13th april , but by the end of march had only removed just over half .
Argumentative	 if syria continues to fail to meet deadlines there have to be consequences , including abandoning the mission .
