Non-Argumentative	this issue is about late-term abortions, in the second and third trimesters.
Non-Argumentative	 at least 90% of abortions are performed in the first trimester, when other procedures are more appropriate.
Non-Argumentative	 in partial-birth abortion (pba), also known as dilation and extraction (d&x), the woman's cervix is dilated, and the foetus is partially removed from the womb, feet first.
Non-Argumentative	 the surgeon inserts a sharp object into the back of the foetus' head, removes it, and inserts a vacuum tube through which the brain is extracted.
Non-Argumentative	 the head of the foetus contracts at this point and allows the foetus to be more easily removed from the womb.
Non-Argumentative	  the main justifications for the use of d&x are: that the foetus is dead; that continued pregnancy will endanger the life of the mother; that continued pregnancy will adversely affect the mother’s health; that the foetus is so malformed that it will never gain consciousness after birth.
Non-Argumentative	 more controversial is the use of the technique for healthy foetuses when the mother’s life is not at risk.
Non-Argumentative	 this is banned by several state medical associations in the us, but many physicians have reported performing them, mainly for women who are suicidally depressed, but also for rape victims and for very young pregnant women.
Non-Argumentative	it is estimated that about 3,000 partial-birth abortions were performed per year in the united states in the 1990s (though this represents around 0.2% of the total number of abortions).
Non-Argumentative	 bill clinton vetoed bills banning partial-birth abortions in 1995,and 1999.
Non-Argumentative	 george w. bush signed a partial-birth abortion ban into law in 2003, and this was found constitutional inby the us supreme court in planned parenthood federation of america v. gonzales (largely reversing the court's decision in acase on state law).
Non-Argumentative	 although this is not necessarily a us-specific debate, the issue is on the political agenda in the usa to an extent which is not matched elsewhere, and some of the arguments here reflect this.
Non-Argumentative	 in running this debate (and with all other abortion debates) it is necessary to consider whether or not an exception will be made for medical necessity.
Non-Argumentative	nb in addition to the arguments below, this debate may well employ arguments from debates about abortion in general – consult the entry for ‘abortion’ in debatabase, and the materials linked to from there.
Argumentative	 partial-birth abortion is disgusting .
Argumentative	 like all abortions , it involves the killing of an unborn child , but unlike first trimester abortions there is no doubt that the foetus can feel pain by the third trimester .
Argumentative	 the procedure involves sticking a pair of scissors into a baby 's brain , enlarging the hole , sucking the brain out with a catheter and then crushing the skull .
Argumentative	 it is entirely unacceptable to do this to a living human being .
Argumentative	 psychological damage to the mother as a result of rape or teenage pregnancy or depression is in the end less significant than the physical damage - death - caused to the child .
Argumentative	 if birth is the crucial dividing-line we use to decide when legal personhood begins , then we should not be allowed to induce birth and then deliberately kill a foetus during that process - this is different from early abortion in which birth is induced and the foetus dies naturally .
Argumentative	 partial-birth abortion is murder , even on the pro-choice understanding of personhood .
Argumentative	 tragically , some babies are unwanted , but this does not mean that we should kill them .
Argumentative	 there are plenty of other options , notably adoption .
Argumentative	 if anything , the case for adoption is more compelling in the third trimester , because the pregnancy is nearer to its natural end and there is less time , only about ten weeks , for the mother to have to put up with it .
Argumentative	 unwanted pregnancy and adoption may be psychologically harmful , but in many cases so is abortion , particularly at a late stage of pregnancy when the mother can see that the dead foetus is recognisably a baby - the guilt feelings associated with feeling that one is responsible for murdering a child can be unbearable .
