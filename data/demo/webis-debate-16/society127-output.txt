Non-Argumentative	the age of consent refers to the age at which a person’s assent to have sex is recognised as valid in the eyes of the law.
Non-Argumentative	 men (and sometimes women, depending upon local law) who engage in sexual activity with young men or women below this age are therefore guilty of a criminal offence.
Non-Argumentative	 this is true even if it was the young person who wanted to have sex and agreed to it in total understanding of what they were doing – the agreement of the person below the age of consent is simply invalid in the eyes of the law.
Non-Argumentative	 yet in many countries this offence (often called ‘statutory rape’, as in the usa) is one that is very severely punished, sometimes with a sentence of up to life imprisonment.
Non-Argumentative	 ages of consent also vary greatly depending on sexuality, in most countries people have to be older to consent to homosexual sex than to heterosexual sex.
Non-Argumentative	 it is the combination of these factors that make age of consent laws highly controversial.
Non-Argumentative	age of consent laws are highly complex because of their many variations, and therefore all too often create difficulty for students in age of consent debates.
Non-Argumentative	 to avoid confusion it is best to:(a) firstly think about the ‘basic’ age of consent rule: for heterosexuals -no sex with anyone belowin england,in most parts of australia,in canada,in italy and varying from state to state betweenandin the u.s.a.(b) secondly think about the ‘plus’ element – many places in addition to the ‘basic’ rule, also make it an offence for you to have sex with persons below a certain age (usuallyor 21) if that person is in a relationship of ‘trust or dependency’ with you.
Non-Argumentative	 this would include relationships between children in foster care and those responsible for their welfare, and those between teacher and student.
Non-Argumentative	 such places include england, australia and canada.
Non-Argumentative	(c) thirdly think about the ‘minus’ element – in subtraction from the above two rules, states may make it not an offence if: (i) you reasonably thought the person was above the ‘basic’ age; or (ii) you reasonably thought you were married to the person ; or (iii) both partners are in similar age (usually 2-5 years).
Non-Argumentative	 in most jurisdictions if the adolescent is really, really young (i.e.in england) then even these ‘minus’ elements will not be allowed as a defence.
Non-Argumentative	there are therefore an almost infinite number of ways in which age of consent laws can be reformed.
Non-Argumentative	 it is less important to know the age details of each rule in each country (16 years?
Non-Argumentative	years?
Non-Argumentative	 14?
Non-Argumentative	 15?)
Non-Argumentative	.
Non-Argumentative	 it is instead very important to think about the ‘basic’, ‘plus’, and ‘minus’ ideas in age of consent laws (such as, should it be a defence if someone had sex with a really, really young girl but honestly believed she was above the legal age of consent?)
Non-Argumentative	.
Non-Argumentative	this article considers the arguments whether, in principle, age of consent rules should be made more liberal (lower or no ‘basic’ age and more generous ‘minus’ elements) or made stricter (same or higher ‘basic’ age and with less or no allowance for ‘minus’ elements).
Argumentative	 the freedom of sexual expression , and exploration , is not only a matter of choice which is fundamental to the individual -- it is also particularly important to young people as they proceed through the stage of adolescence into young adulthood .
Argumentative	 age of consent laws place artificial limits on this freedom .
Argumentative	 sex is entirely natural and should be celebrated in the context of loving relationships , not criminalised and put under the prying eye of an authoritarian state .
Argumentative	 violence , coercion and exploitation in sexual relationships should still be punished , but not consensual activity .
Argumentative	 such restrictions go against the human rights to privacy and of freedom of expression .
Argumentative	 the concept that young people do not know what they are doing is flawed , because every person who has gone through sexual development has learnt by doing .
Argumentative	 there is no process of suddenly coming into full knowledge without acting and exploration .
Argumentative	 such exploration would be more safely done in an environment that does n't criminalize it .
Argumentative	 such criminalization can actaully lead to the very harm that the law ostensibly seeks to avoid , coercion and exploitation , for it is people who are naturally more inclined to coercion and exploitation that will disregard the law anyway .
Argumentative	 this feeds the lambs to the wolves .
Argumentative	 some countries have one age of consent for young females , say, and a different , higher age of consent for young males or for having anal sex , say.
Argumentative	 this means that a heterosexual adult male who wants to have sex with a 17-year-old female is free to do so , but a homosexual adult male can not have intercourse with a young man who is.
Argumentative	 not only are such laws clearly discriminatory , they entrench and perpetuate the myths , stereotypes , and prejudices against homosexuals and homosexual sex .
Argumentative	 age of consent laws , if we are to have them at all , should be equalised across the genders .
Argumentative	 the idea that young people should not be having sex is a leftover relic from the past : its justifications are anachronistic and have little place in modern times .
Argumentative	 age of consent laws were the product of a ` purity campaign ' in britain in the 1800s , when it was believed that sex was a ` male privilege ' , that it led to the sexual ruin of young women , that it meant the loss of their virtue , which was a fate worse than death , and that it contributed to women 's second class citizenship .
Argumentative	 in the uk the age ofwas chosen and set in, more thanyears ago , and has remained ever since .
Argumentative	 today these ideas would offend both men and women .
Argumentative	 age of consent laws are in fact dangerous because they drive underground the very people who should be , and are in most need of , receiving contraceptives , advice on safe sex , and access to health and other educational services .
Argumentative	 this is true both of the ` statutory rapist ' as well as the under-16 consenting ` victim ' , who may worry about having assisted in the commission of a crime .
Argumentative	 both parties then become real victims as they are put at greater risk of contracting stds or unwanted pregnancies .
