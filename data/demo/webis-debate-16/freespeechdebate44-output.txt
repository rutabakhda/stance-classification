Non-Argumentative	a textbook entitled new history textbook (atarashii rekishi kyokasho) was published by a committee consisting of conservative scholars in 2000, and was approved as a social science textbook for junior high schools by the ministry of education in 2001.
Non-Argumentative	 this caused controversy and heated debates both domestically and internationally especially in relation to neighbouring countries, such as china and korea, affecting japanese diplomatic relations with them.
Non-Argumentative	 official approval of the textbook was seen as controversial, as it underplayed japan’s war-time aggression during the sino-japanese war and the second world war.
Non-Argumentative	 in practice however, the new history textbook was adopted by only a few schools in japan.
Non-Argumentative	in our japanese junior high school textbook in the 1990s comfort women did exist and japanese imperialism was an act of aggression.
Non-Argumentative	 what is presented by the textbook is far removed from our understanding of japan’s national history but others can contest its veracity much better than we can here.
Non-Argumentative	instead we want to think about how politics is always implicated in the writing or, in this particular instance, rewriting and not writing of the past.
Non-Argumentative	 it is not a trivial fact that the publication of the textbook was preceded by a period of instability, during which the long-incumbent liberal democratic party lost control over some of its right-wing members.
Non-Argumentative	 at the same time, the textbook was adopted by a very small minority of local school boards, not least, because a large enough number of concerned citizens spoke out against its use.
Non-Argumentative	 in that sense, a plurality of voices as well as the means to express those voices were present in japan, as they should be in a country with institutions that enable free speech.
Non-Argumentative	in response to this heated controversy, in 2002, japan, china and south korea formed a joint research committee on the content of history textbooks.
Non-Argumentative	 this committee was expected to be a forum for the three countries to exchange their views on history and the textbook.
Non-Argumentative	 controversy abated thereafter.
Non-Argumentative	 the committee continues its activities today and it has published several reference books of history drawn from discussions among experts and incorporating views from each country.
Non-Argumentative	 however, there are inherent obstacles in accurately reflecting voices from abroad in texts produced as a part of a school curriculum that is one of the sites for the diffusion of national historical narratives, all the more so when these conflict with the narratives of their neighbours.
Non-Argumentative	ultimately this controversy begs a fundamental question that goes to the heart of the nature of liberal democracy and the nation-state.
Non-Argumentative	 should a state be accountable to the voices of people beyond its national borders?
Argumentative	- ayako komine and naoko hosokawathe japanese government is not forcing schools to teach japanese history in a way that whitewashes the japanese record in world war ii .
Argumentative	 in japan the ministry of education screens textbooks and when they are approved makes them available .
Argumentative	 schools are then allowed to select their textbook from a list of seven or eight textbooks that have been approved both by the ministry .
Argumentative	 by making this choice schools are exercising their freedom of speech in deciding what should be taught in their classrooms .
Argumentative	 in the case of the new history textbook , atarashii rekishi kyokasho , not a single state run junior high school adopted the textbook resulting in a mere 0.03 % of junior high school students using the textbook .
Argumentative	 by contrast china 's textbooks and their misrepresentations are mandatory .
Argumentative	 this shows that when the japanese people are given freedom of information on the issue they exercise this right responsibly .
Argumentative	 to state the obvious there is an immense amount of history .
Argumentative	 there is much more history than could ever be taught in school .
Argumentative	 this means there needs to be some way to cut down everything in history into a sensible sized syllabus .
Argumentative	 there are some obvious ways to cut down history to a manageable length ; such as concentrating on the history of the nation , focusing on certain key events , focusing on things of particular importance to today , or sometimes just on things that are considered fun and interesting .
Argumentative	 in the uk there have been accusations , including by the current education secretary michael gove , that british history is neglected in favour of nazi germany and the american west -- something that then avoids britain 's less than comfortable imperial past .
Argumentative	 it should therefore come as no surprise that japan does not highlight world war ii and in particular the bad parts of that conflict .
Argumentative	 does china teach about its invasion of tibet ?
Argumentative	 history is not about learning all history , it is not about learning particular bits of history , it is not even necessarily about learning a nations ' story , rather it is about encouraging students to think critically .
Argumentative	 it has been regularly shown that stuffing children with facts turns them off a subject instead there should be interaction , discussion , analysing texts from the time and analysing bias .
Argumentative	 the space in the textbook devoted to the issues is very limited and therefore what they mention does not matter particularly much .
Argumentative	 what matters therefore is how the teachers teach the issues as they will have to supplement the textbooks with other works and there is a wide range to choose from .
Argumentative	 what matters then is how the teachers expand on the issues within the textbook rather than the textbook itself -- the textbook could even be useful at studying the subject by providing a source to study bias on wwii .
Argumentative	 to some the idea of a national story may be an anachronism but history is one of the things that bind a country together .
Argumentative	 as benedict anderson argues nations are ` imagined communities ' as members of that nation will never know most of the members of that community or even hear about them but despite this there is conceived to be a comradeship between its members .
Argumentative	 the creation of a national story from the history of the nation that helps create that common unit .
Argumentative	 french historian ernest renan went so far as to argue that ` getting its history wrong is part of being a nation ' .
Argumentative	 south korean president lee myung-bak himself has argued `` a textbook of modern history should be written in a way that does not hurt our national pride , '' when criticising a south korean textbook 's interpretation of the dividing of korea .
Argumentative	 if this is the case it is difficult to see how there can be any objection to japan using the same principle .
