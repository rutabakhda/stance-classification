Non-Argumentative	the abolishment of nuclear weapons would constitute the complete and multi-lateral disarmament of all current nuclear weapons and material earmarked specifically for their development or production.
Non-Argumentative	nuclear weapons first dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945, forever changed the face of war, and the half-century of cold war which followed was dominated, above all, by the threat of nuclear destruction.
Non-Argumentative	 both superpowers raced to produce a greater arsenal than their opponents, leading to the point where they had the ability to destroy the world several times over.
Non-Argumentative	 added to the direct destructive power of the weapons was the consensus growing among scientists from 1970s onwards that a major war would plunge the world into a ‘nuclear winter’, destroying life even in places that had escaped attack.
Non-Argumentative	 this led to the concept of ‘mutually assured destruction’, a stalemate in which both sides knew that the use of their weapons would lead to their own destruction as well as their enemies.
Non-Argumentative	 the global situation has, however, changed substantially since the end of the cold war.
Non-Argumentative	 nuclear weapons have ceased to dominate world politics; however, the fear of proliferation – the spread of weapons of mass destruction to many more countries – is also on the rise.
Non-Argumentative	 india, pakistan, israel and north korea are all now believed to be nuclear powers, and many fear that iran will soon join them.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents focus on the total abolition of the world’s nuclear arsenals as a realistic and necessary goal to aim for.
Non-Argumentative	 it will take time, as president obama has recently argued “i'm not naive.
Non-Argumentative	 this goal will not be reached quickly –- perhaps not in my lifetime.”
Non-Argumentative	 the opposition is more pragmatic, not defending the weapons per se but insisting that they remain a necessary means to a peaceful end.
Non-Argumentative	president obama has moved the idea of nuclear disarmament up the international agenda.
Non-Argumentative	 in prague inhe stated “so today, i state clearly and with conviction america's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.”
Non-Argumentative	 obama followed up with a nuclear security summit which sought to safeguard nuclear materials but did not much advance any attempt to abolish nuclear weapons.
Argumentative	 nuclear weapons are , by their very nature , indiscriminate and disproportional ; any weapon which could not possibly be used in a responsible manner should not be permitted .
Argumentative	 over the past fifty years , we have seen a general tendency towards limited warfare and precision weapons , allowing military objectives to be achieved with minimal loss of civilian life .
Argumentative	 the entire point of nuclear weapons , however , is their massive , indiscriminate destructive power .
Argumentative	 their use could kill tens of thousands of civilians directly , and their catastrophic environmental after-effects would harm many more all around the world .
Argumentative	 these effects could never be morally acceptable , particularly as the basis of one 's national security strategy .
Argumentative	 they place ` humanity and most forms of life in jeopardy of annihilation ' , krieger  .
Argumentative	 no state or leader can be entrusted , morally , with a power and responsibility that could come close to annihilating humanity .
Argumentative	 by claiming the efficacy of nuclear weapons as a strategic deterrent , the current nuclear powers encourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , krieger  .
Argumentative	 to be a part of the so-called ` nuclear club ' is seen as a matter of great prestige ; when india and pakistan recently declared their nuclear capability and held mutual tests in the 1990s , it was seen in both countries as increasing their international status .
Argumentative	 nevertheless , tensions in the region have only increased since the mutual announcements , not least the kargil war ofthat almost precipitated a nuclear war .
Argumentative	 nations opposed to a nuclear power therefore feel that they need to develop their own capability in order to protect themselves .
Argumentative	 the declared nuclear powers must therefore take the lead in disarmament , as an example for the rest of the world .
Argumentative	 while nuclear weapons exist , they can fall into the wrong hands .
Argumentative	 this is particularly prevalent in an environment whereby there are extremist groups actively seeking to cause instant , egregious harm to their ideological and political enemies .
Argumentative	 such groups do not lack for funding ; therefore the fear of weapons falling into the wrong hands has never been higher .
Argumentative	 this is particularly true in russia , which now has control of all of the nuclear weapons which were distributed around the former soviet union .
Argumentative	 in particular during the 1990s the military was disastrously underfunded ; technicians and officers who were used to a high standard of living found themselves without pay , sometimes for years .
Argumentative	 at the same time , other states and extremist groups are willing to pay substantial sums for their services , and to gain access to nuclear weapons .
Argumentative	 this same danger is now as much , if not more , of a problem in pakistan , ambinder  .
Argumentative	 the danger of a weapon being stolen , or a nuclear base being taken over by disgruntled members of the military or other extremists , can only be ended by destroying the weapons , allison  .
Argumentative	 the disproportionate and indiscriminate nature of nuclear weapons use renders their possession illegal under international humanitarian law .
Argumentative	 the international court of justice in, asked to provide an advisory opinion , declared unanimously that any use or threat of nuclear weapons had to be compatible with existing international law relating to armed conflict , international court of justice  .
Argumentative	 the principles of discrimination and proportionality inherent in the laws of wars are codified in the geneva conventions of, and are quite clearly violated by nuclear weapons .
Argumentative	 as such , a majority of the judges present felt that any such use or threat would ` generally be contrary ' to those rules of international law and therefore , unanimously , ` there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ' , international court of justice  .
Argumentative	 the co-operation of the united states and russia , demonstrated in their regularly-renewed start treaties , confer the ability of nuclear powers to work towards a reduction in nuclear stockpiles .
Argumentative	 a new campaigning body , global zero , has laid out the path to nuclear abolishment , concerning first bilateral accords to reduce stockpiles in the manner already occurring .
Argumentative	 from there , they advocate the ` universal acceptance of a comprehensive verification and enforcement system accompanied by tighter controls on fissile materials produced by civil-nuclear programmes ' , the economist  .
Argumentative	 the process will not be swift , but it is plausible and not a stretch considering the success of previous start treaties and the example of the international atomic energy agency as an independent body charged with verifying nuclear installations .
