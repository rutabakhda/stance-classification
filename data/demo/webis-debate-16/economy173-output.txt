Non-Argumentative	in finance, a bond is an instrument of indebtedness where the issuer, in this case the government or the european union, is indebted to the holder (a form of loan).
Non-Argumentative	 the terms may vary but the issuer is obliged to pay the holder interest and/or to repay the holder at a later date, termed the maturity which can often be as long as thirty years.
Non-Argumentative	 interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly).
Non-Argumentative	 bonds provide the borrower with funds to finance long-term investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.
Non-Argumentative	the suggestion for european bonds (eurobonds) is that government bonds for the eurozone should be issued in euros jointly by theeurozone nations.
Non-Argumentative	 the holder is therefore giving money to the eurozone bloc altogether, which then forwards the money to individual governments, rather than each individual government issuing its own bonds.
Non-Argumentative	since the beginning of the crisis, countries tried to resolve the problem with the help of bailouts provided the european stability mechanism (esm) or its predecessors.
Non-Argumentative	 the esm is an international organization established onseptemberthat will cover any new bailouts it will ensure that member governments have access to money by providing instant access to financial assistance for member states in financial difficulty.
Non-Argumentative	 it has a maximum lending capacity of €500 billion.
Non-Argumentative	 this however is regarded by many simply as a stopgap to cover any new crises rather than a long term solution.
Non-Argumentative	in the status quo, sovereign-bonds are issued by national governments with an interest rate that is different from country to country, making them affordable for countries like germany or the netherlands but extremely expensive for greece, spain, italy and others.
Non-Argumentative	 for example greece has an interest rate of 8.47% on its yields, while germany is at 1.86%.
Non-Argumentative	 eurobonds will still be issued by national governments with full responsibility for the loan but they will have to be backed by the european central bank (ecb) and will be listed on the market as one product, with a singular interest rate.
Argumentative	 one of the most important european union principles is solidarity and mutual respect among european citizens and this can only be achieved by more integration and stronger connections between states .
Argumentative	 the economic crisis has clearly shown that more integration is necessary if europe is to prevent suffering and economic hardship .
Argumentative	 from the economic perspective , unemployment rates reached disastrous levels inwith greece at 24,3 % and spain% .
Argumentative	 there is a lack of leadership and connection between countries in the european union that is not allowing them to help one-another and solve the economic crisis .
Argumentative	 from the political point of view the result of this is that extremist parties are on the rise with the best example of golden dawn in greece .
Argumentative	 while inandthe party did n't win any seats in the greek parliament , after the crisis hit in junethey wonseats .
Argumentative	 in time of distress , the logical solution is not that every country should fight for itself but rather the willingness to invest and integrate more in the union to provide a solution for all .
Argumentative	 eurobonds provides the integration that will help prevent these problems , it will both halt the current crisis of government debts because governments will have lower interest repayments and not have the threat of default , and it will show solidarity between members .
Argumentative	 this in turn will help any future integration as showing that europe cares for those in difficulty will make everyone more willing to invest in the project .
Argumentative	 introducing eurobonds will lower interest rates for bonds issued by national governments so making the loans affordable .
Argumentative	 the most recent example of this problem is the need of recapitalization of banks in cyprus .
Argumentative	 although government debt and interest rates were not the direct problem if the government had been able to borrow at low interest rates to recapitalize its own banks then it would have not needed a bailout from the rest of the eurozone .
Argumentative	 in order to avoid these kinds of solutions and put people back to work in countries like portugal , italy or spain , national governments need a bigger demand for their bonds so that interest rates go down .
Argumentative	 right now , sovereign-bonds are not affordable for the government as their interest rates are extremely high .
Argumentative	 greece has an interest rate of 9.01 % , portugal 6.23 % , and italy and spain near 4.30 % .
Argumentative	 if we choose to bundle the bonds together we will obtain a single interest rate that will lower the price of bonds and permit countries to borrow more , the price would be closer to germany 's than greece 's as the eurozone as a whole is not more risky than other big economies .
Argumentative	 more than that , the markets wo n't be worry anymore of the possible default of countries like greece ; as the bonds are backed up by the ecb and indirectly by other countries in the union , the debtors will know that their loans will be repaid because in the last resort more financially solvent countries take on the burden .
Argumentative	 when the risk of default is eliminated , the demand for government bonds will rise and the interest rates will go down .
Argumentative	 it is estimated that italy could save up to% of its gdp and portugal would see annual repayments fall by 15bn euros , or% of its gdp .
Argumentative	 the european union should not only focus on the present but also try to find a permanent solution in resolving and preventing economic crisis .
Argumentative	 the solution that is implemented right now through the european stability mechanism is a temporary one and has no power in preventing further crisis .
Argumentative	 first of all , the failure of the european union to agree on banks bailout is a good example .
Argumentative	 as economic affairs commissioner olli rehn admitted the bailout negotiations have been `` a long and difficult process '' because of the many institutions and ministers that have a say in making the decision .
Argumentative	 more than that , it sometimes takes weeks and even months until germany and other leaders in the union can convince national parliaments to give money in order for us to be able to help those in need .
Argumentative	 issuing bonds as a union of countries will provide more control to the ecb that will be able to approve or deny a loan -- one option would be that after a certain limit countries would have to borrow on their own .
Argumentative	 this will prevent countries from borrowing and spending irrationally like greece , portugal , spain and italy did in the past .
Argumentative	 the unsustainable economic approach can be easily seen in the fact that public sector wages in greece rose% betweenand- far faster than in most other eurozone countries .
Argumentative	 clearly greece could make the choice to go separately to the market to fund this kind of spending but it would be unlikely to do so .
