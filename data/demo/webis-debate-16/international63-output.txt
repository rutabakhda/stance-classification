Non-Argumentative	on the 30th may 2011, the ethiopian government announced plans for the construction of the ‘grand ethiopian renaissance dam’ (gerd).
Non-Argumentative	 set to be africa’s largest gravity dam atm tall and 1,800 m wide, it will span the width of one of two major tributaries that create the nile; the blue nile.
Non-Argumentative	 the gerd is expected to be completed by julyand will produce 6,000 mw of electricity.
Non-Argumentative	  the dam is expected to be able to generate energy for all of ethiopia, however egypt’s and sudan’s positions downstream from the gerd have made them question the impact of the dam on their respective countries.
Non-Argumentative	over the next two years tensions continued to mount.
Non-Argumentative	 the majority of egypt’s water comes from outside its borders, the nile is 96% of egypt’s renewable water, which has led egypt to fervently defend its water rights.
Non-Argumentative	 instability within egypt, caused by the arab spring and the toppling of president hosni mubarak, meant that the issue was not addressed until mohamed morsi was elected as president.
Non-Argumentative	  during the year that morsi spent in office, and the months afterwards where an interim government took charge, there have been rising political tensions between the two states disputing whether ethiopia really does have the right to build the gerd.
Argumentative	 when the dam is in full effect , it should be able to provide the entirety of ethiopia 's population with electricity .
Argumentative	 the united nations foundation placed access to energy as a high priority for developing countries , it enables access to key services and enables more income-generating activities .
Argumentative	 if ethiopia discontinued the project , then they would deprive their citizens of economic and health security .
Argumentative	 using energy from a dam will have its own benefits .
Argumentative	 the energy will be renewable source and will provide energy security for this developing state , thus justifying the project .
Argumentative	 the dam will produce significant economic potential for ethiopia .
Argumentative	 in, ethiopia had to import 125,000 metric tonnes of coal to fuel its power stations .
Argumentative	 over% of the country 's imports are orientated towards meeting its fuel demands .
Argumentative	 if ethiopia can replace these imports with its own energy then it can make significant savings .
Argumentative	 the diverted money could be contributed towards development , which would be assisted by greater accessibility to electricity .
Argumentative	 in addition to this , 12,000 jobs will be created and ethiopia will become an energy exporter .
Argumentative	 the excess energy from powering africa will be enough to supply the surrounding region , making energy a viable export market for ethiopia to tap in to .
Argumentative	 in combination with the greater access electricity dependent to income-generating activities , these factors give ethiopia hope of a positive economic future .
Argumentative	 gerd will have environmentally positive consequences for the region .
Argumentative	 the major environmental benefit is the clean and renewable energy source .
Argumentative	 there is an unlimited supply of electricity and the production of this energy does not contribute to global carbon dioxide emissions .
Argumentative	 another environmental benefit is that the dam will reduce the chances of flooding downstream and drought , enabling the country to better combat climate change which is worsening these factors .
Argumentative	 flood protection will prevent settled areas from being destroyed through rising river levels , benefitting sudan and egypt as well as ethiopia .
