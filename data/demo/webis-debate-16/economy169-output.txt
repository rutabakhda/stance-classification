Non-Argumentative	low unemployment is not only crucial for a functioning economy, but for a society.
Non-Argumentative	 after thefinancial crisis and start of the eurozone crisis in 2009, and subsequent worldwide sluggish economy, unemployment has become more of a problem in the european union.
Non-Argumentative	 concerns about debt and growth have discouraged investment, and in a number of states in the eu, such as portugal, ireland, greece and spain, caused states to require bailouts, often under the condition of the imposition of austerity measures.
Non-Argumentative	 austerity measures have meant public sector job losses in the countries concerned and even many countries that have not had austerity enforced by the size of their debt have been engaging in cutting back the public sector.
Non-Argumentative	 as a result, the seasonally adjusted employment rate in the eu as a whole (including both the countries who have been bailed out, and those bailing them out, such as germany and the netherlands) has increased from 7.5% in julyto 11% in july 2013.
Non-Argumentative	unemployment is not evenly spread across demographic groups, however.
Non-Argumentative	 according to eurostat, the group with the highest rate of unemployment is young people – 23.4% of under 25s were unemployed in 2013, compared to 7.6% in 2008.
Non-Argumentative	 this does not include people in education so almost a quarter of young people who finish school or university are finding that they cannot find a job.
Non-Argumentative	 youth unemployment not only causes problems to individuals, but broader social problems in the countries, in addition to the financial cost of social security, and the wasted potential.
Non-Argumentative	 the only long term solution to this is an economic recovery however this is something that is unlikely to happen quickly, even once the economy begins to recover it will be years before many countries reach full employment.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore, it has been proposed that a solution to youth unemployment is to guarantee young people a temporary job.
Non-Argumentative	this job could last for six months, which could be enough time to gain the skills which are needed to find further work and for the young people to show they can do a job.
Non-Argumentative	 government would fund this.
Non-Argumentative	 furthermore, government would fund training or preparation necessary for a person to do this.
Non-Argumentative	 however there would be limits to ensure it is not too expensive to train individuals.
Non-Argumentative	 the only requirement for private companies would be to create as many roles as needed.
Argumentative	 the eu member states should rely more on public employment services , which should be focused on finding jobs for young people .
Argumentative	 with government funding , they can work with the private sector to offer decent temporary jobs to young people .
Argumentative	 this model is common in the nordic states and other countries , such as austria , germany and switzerland also have similar programs .
Argumentative	 youth unemployment is already far higher than for older people .
Argumentative	 less than a third of under 25s who were looking for a job infound one in-- this may be due to ageist discrimination against young people , and employers seeking people with experience .
Argumentative	 people overare also considered as a high risk group .
Argumentative	 they have little experience so the employer is taking a risk in employing them .
Argumentative	 there is also a desire for stability ; those who already have a family are unlikely to want large changes so employers feel they can bet on them for the long term .
Argumentative	 if the problem is a lack of experience then this proposal solves the problem .
Argumentative	 giving younger people a temporary job and the experience that goes with it will help give everyone an equal chance at getting a job , irrespective of age .
Argumentative	 therefore , the eu should step in and help provide jobs for younger people .
Argumentative	 rising youth unemployment can be considered an international timebomb .
Argumentative	 young people are the next generation of workers and consumers in the economy .
Argumentative	 when they are unemployed , the situation can be alarming .
Argumentative	 this is because of the importance of getting a job early on so as to avoid becoming long term unemployed .
Argumentative	 the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has called for stronger policies involving young people .
Argumentative	 the ilo has warned that youth unemployment can lead to apathy towards government and political instability .
Argumentative	 the lack of experience in work may cause a lost generation .
Argumentative	 this must be averted , and the eu is one of the best placed to do this .
Argumentative	 the temporary work scheme would encourage business to change their attitude and hire more young workers .
Argumentative	 having to hire young people , even for a short time , would help break negative stereotypes and often the employers would then offer longer term work .
Argumentative	 this would help to fill the 2million unfilled vacancies that exist in the eu with young people .
Argumentative	 while we often think of workplace diversity as being about having people from all over the world and both men and women a good age balance is necessary too .
Argumentative	 by bringing in this policy , younger workers will be in the same workplaces as older employees , and vice versa , making for more workplace diverse .
Argumentative	 employees will learn from those with more experience , in addition to the other advantages of a more diverse workforce .
Argumentative	 one of these is more engagement and engaged workers perform% better and are less likely to leave .
Argumentative	 another is that young people will contribute new and innovative ways of thinking , with different viewpoints pushing the business forward .
Argumentative	 finally a company needs to have all ages in the business to ensure that there are people with experience when older workers retire .
Argumentative	 diversity is also crucial for the appearance of a business .
Argumentative	 the kind of company that attracts a broader pool of individuals means a greater range of talented candidates to choose from .
Argumentative	 businesses who create more diverse workplaces perform better .
Argumentative	 if the government is employing people then it is going to be boosting the economy .
Argumentative	 providing a fiscal boost by spending money is one of the most accepted ways of boosting the economy .
Argumentative	 in this case spending money on temporary workers is good in several ways .
Argumentative	 first it is a fiscal boost to the economy .
Argumentative	 the government will be paying the temporary workers .
Argumentative	 these workers will have more money to spend and will probably mostly spend it rather than saving .
Argumentative	 this in turn boosts demand for other goods and services so meaning there needs to be more output with the result that some jobs will be made permanent .
Argumentative	 there is therefore a positive feedback loop .
Argumentative	 the second way in which this helps the economy is that it is investment .
Argumentative	 it is investment because the government is paying for young people to gain experience and for companies to be training these temporary workers .
Argumentative	 the result of this is a more skilled workforce who in the long term will be more productive .
Argumentative	 there is a final possible benefit .
Argumentative	 with government paying for workers they are effectively subsidizing firms .
Argumentative	 even if they are new trainees the young temporary workers will be providing output for companies at next to no cost .
Argumentative	 this then makes that firm more competitive against its global competitors .
