Non-Argumentative	nearly all secondary school students (from age eleven) in eu countries are obliged to study at least one modern foreign language up to their final year.
Non-Argumentative	 many students study two.
Non-Argumentative	 some start learning foreign languages at primary level and, by school leaving age, no longer consider the languages they have acquired as “foreign”.
Non-Argumentative	 italy, the republic of ireland and the uk are the exceptions where learning a foreign language in school is not compulsory.
Non-Argumentative	 outside of europe, less than half american high school students learn foreign languages  despite 91% of secondary schools offering a foreign language as a part of the curriculum.
Non-Argumentative	 this however does not seem to be affecting the popularity of foreign languages at the tertiary level with enrolments for arabic growing by 46% betweenand 2009.
Non-Argumentative	 by contrast, approximatelymillion students learn english in china, but only 24,000 us pupils make the effort to learn chinese languages.
Non-Argumentative	the english speaking world seems to believe it need not learn foreign languages as most foreigners display competence in english.
Non-Argumentative	 foreign language learning in british schools ceased to be compulsory inand in 2010, only 44% of british gcse (general certificate of secondary education) students (up toyears) studied a language.
Non-Argumentative	in august 2010, the national assembly of wales announced its plan to spend £4 million on welsh language training and welsh speaking schools are prevalent in wales.
Non-Argumentative	 all students in the republic of ireland study both english and irish, and some gaelic language schools are still in action in scotland.
Non-Argumentative	 however, despite being given a platform to avoid language death, these minority languages in the british isles are not considered “foreign” and their presence does not encourage nor empower the students in the uk and ireland to learn yet more languages.
Non-Argumentative	the question therefore is whether learning foreign languages should remain compulsory for all school students up to the age of 16.
Argumentative	 a high number of students failing to succeed in languages is not a valid reason to make the subject optional .
Argumentative	 this mentality opens the gate to making english and math options , simply to eradicate the effort of improving pass rates .
Argumentative	 the british broadcasting corporation , bbc , reports that in the uk `` a quarter of secondary pupils , agedand over , fail to reach their potential in math , s , and a quarter are making insufficient progress in english '' .
Argumentative	 still , optional english and math is unthinkable ; these are core subjects - languages should also be considered as such .
Argumentative	 those who want to transfer students energies from foreign languages to english are ignoring the possibility that learning a foreign language may actually be useful for learning the first language .
Argumentative	 students failing in core subjects must be helped to improve , not have the subject eradicated .
Argumentative	 languages are extremely beneficial to the economy in two senses .
Argumentative	 firstly , language skills improve a job candidate 's chances of selection , which keeps unemployment down .
Argumentative	 the national centre for languages , cilt , reports on its website that ``% of employers recruit people with languages '' , ``% of employers are dissatisfied with school leavers ' language skills '' and that ``% of london employers think that language skills are important for the london economy '' .
Argumentative	 secondly , a high number of employees with language skills enhance companies ' abilities to engage in trade and to expand their business abroad , in turn enhancing exports .
Argumentative	 the call for students to learn a foreign language not only stems from economic needs but also from the need of improved security and diplomacy , in particular a better understanding of cultures and languages in order to better understand threats to the state and improved foreign services are needed .
Argumentative	 in many anglophone countries even in the role of a diplomat there are worrying numbers who do not have the language skills they need , for example in canada `` only% of theforeign service officers who were required to have advanced foreign languages skills for their positions , could speak the needed language . ''
Argumentative	 as anational academy of sciences report warns us `` the pervasive lack of knowledge of foreign languages and cultures threatens the security of the united states as well as its ability to compete in the global marketplace and produce an unformed citizenry '' .
Argumentative	 since the increased security post 9/11 the government accountability office , gao , have reported that there are a shortage of foreign language expertise within the government and for this reason may undermine national security .
Argumentative	 much of the population of mainland europe go to great lengths to learn foreign languages , especially the dominant english .
Argumentative	 english speakers should reciprocate the efforts made by their foreign counterparts ; nicolas sarkozy for example is aiming to make france into a bilingual nation .
Argumentative	 across europe at least% of third-level students claim to be proficient in at least two foreign languages .
Argumentative	 however , in countries where english is a major language , this is not the case ; in ireland , for example the figure is only% .
Argumentative	 in the united states the situation is similar only% of us elementary schools and% of public schools teach foreign languages .
Argumentative	 expecting foreign countries to communicate through dominant english is a lazy and arrogant attitude to language and should not be permitted .
Argumentative	 therefore learning languages up to the age of sixteen should be compulsory .
Argumentative	 the problems students face when learning languages are the fault of teaching methods , not language ability .
Argumentative	 madeline ehrman observes that the root of this problem is that the `` student is `` out of sync '' with the methodology , the teacher . ''
Argumentative	 therefore , the antidote is more modern learning styles ; `` there are some quick fixes that can be made when adaptations are needed '' .
Argumentative	 languages should not be abandoned when students find them boring rather the curriculum and methods of teaching need to be changed to make the learning more interesting and more relevant .
Argumentative	 for example students struggle even with their own grammar so an emphasis on making themselves understood rather than correct grammar may be more useful .
Argumentative	 to refuse to learn foreign languages is narrow-minded , ignorant and blinkered .
Argumentative	 language is a means not only of asserting identity but , more importantly of `` heritage culture maintenance '' .
Argumentative	 to refuse to learn a foreign language is to disallow anyone 's culture apart from one 's own to be upheld .
Argumentative	 when this happens , `` the dominant groups force ethnic groups into particular ... niches '' .
Argumentative	 this is particularly likely to be a problem in multicultural societies or indeed any society that is not homogeneous .
Argumentative	 by refusing to learn foreign languages , one refuses to recognise that other cultures even exist .
Argumentative	 for this reason learning a foreign language helps to tackle xenophobia .
Argumentative	 negative stereotyping is sadly still prevalent in the modern world .
Argumentative	 `` american students in maine view persons speaking standard french as shorter , less leaderlike , sic , less thoughtful , less intelligent , less honest , less self-confident , less dependable , less generous , less kind , less ambitious , less stable and with less character than english speakers '' .
Argumentative	 such stereotypes lead to prejudices , xenophobia and , in extreme cases , hate crime .
Argumentative	 learning foreign languages is a good way to combat such prejudices , because the students learn about the foreign culture for themselves , meet and converse with its people , and have a first-hand introduction to a foreign people .
Argumentative	 this will leave them more open minded towards other cultures so less likely to be xenophobic towards other cultures whose language they have not learnt .
Argumentative	 as reynolds explains , `` discounting stereotypes involves denying cultural differences '' such as the ability to communicate through the same language .
Argumentative	 students should have a fundamental freedom of choice when it comes to all but the most necessary subjects .
Argumentative	 if students want to specialise in for example science and drop foreign languages in order to be able to do this then they should have this option , a choice which is likely to be beneficial for their chosen career .
Argumentative	 students ' progress in their most successful subjects should not be hindered by the burden of language learning .
Argumentative	 it is not the case that students do not desire to engage in languages because they are lazy , narrow-minded or blinkered .
Argumentative	 rather , because they demonstrate real strength in other subjects they do not wish to be constrained in those subjects by ones where they do not excel .
Argumentative	 a standard complaint is quoted by ehrman ; `` , learning languages , affects , all study , a lot !
Argumentative	 i 'm finding it just depressing to have to study , when my only reason for being here is to meet a requirement ... it really annoys me to have to waste my time on this , when i could be learning something i 'll use after graduation ... the pressure 's just too much for me ! ''
Argumentative	 students should be allowed and encouraged to channel all their energy and enthusiasm into the subjects they are best at and most enthusiastic towards .
