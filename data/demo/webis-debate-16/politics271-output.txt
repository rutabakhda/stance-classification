Non-Argumentative	national missile defense programs represent efforts to build and deploy ballistic missile interceptors.
Non-Argumentative	 since the reagan administration, the united states has, under various guises, sought to develop technology that would render enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles non-threatening to its people and interests.
Non-Argumentative	 from the outset, the development of such defensive armaments has been controversial.
Non-Argumentative	 were they to be implemented, they would render the nuclear deterrent capability of countries meaningless.
Non-Argumentative	 some believe this would make the world safer, generally rendering nuclear weapons useless.
Non-Argumentative	 others believe that it will only be a catalyst for war, as countries seek to penetrate one anotherâ€™s strategic missile defenses.
Argumentative	 debates hinge around both the efficacy of anti-ballistic missile technology, and whether their implementation will create conflict or be a tool for peace.
Argumentative	the nation-state is the fundamental building block of the international system , and is recognized as such in all international treaties and organizations , mearsheimer  .
Argumentative	 states are recognized as having the right to defend themselves , and this right must extend to the possession of a strategic national missile defense system .
Argumentative	 the united states has every right to develop such a system if it will furnish a greater measure of defense for its citizens and interests .
Argumentative	 us military technology is the most advanced and prodigiously financed in the world , which is why it is generally the united states that stands at the forefront of new defense and combat systems .
Argumentative	 the national missile defense program is simply the newest tool in the arsenal of the world 's greatest military , whose purpose is entirely defensive .
Argumentative	 to shield itself from potential ballistic missile , and even nuclear , attack the united states has the right to build a missile shield to defend itself and its allies under its aegis .
Argumentative	 there is no principled justification for a country to not pursue defense initiatives that benefit itself and that it wishes to pursue .
Argumentative	 the missile defense shield the united states intends to build is the most effective and complete ballistic missile shield ever devised .
Argumentative	 when fully armed with a complement of anti-ballistic missiles both within the united states itself , and in allied nations in europe , the shield will be virtually impregnable to external missile attack .
Argumentative	 this means the chance of a nuclear attack succeeding against it will be very unlikely , reducing the chance not only of a full-scale nuclear war between the united states and another nuclear power , but also against missiles fired by rogue states or terrorists , the biggest threats in terms of actual use of nuclear weapons , the economist  .
Argumentative	 technologically speaking , anti-ballistic missile missiles have developed by leaps and bounds in recent years .
Argumentative	 the current system being put into operation by the united states is the aegis combat system , designed for deployment on us naval vessels .
Argumentative	 this new development has served to sidestep the problems associated with ground and space-based missile defense arrays , due to the slow response time of ground missiles , and the still unfeasible orbital deployment .
Argumentative	 the sea-based defense array , furthermore , lacks the problem of the land-based system in that it does not need to be placed in countries other than the united states in order to be effective , thus avoiding the political problems of the past .
Argumentative	 technology and diplomacy have clearly made a national missile defense system highly desirable .
Argumentative	 with a fully functioning missile defense shield deployed , nuclear-armed ballistic missiles become obsolete , unable to ever reach their targets .
Argumentative	 this means countries ' strategic obsession with second-strike capacity , the ability to return fire with nuclear weapons should they be attacked by them , mutually assured destruction , will cease to be an issue , as first-strikes are destined to be wiped out before they hit a single target .
Argumentative	 what this means is that countries with missile defense systems can feel secure without the need of retaining massive nuclear arsenals .
Argumentative	 this will alleviate the pressure to have stockpiles of warheads and will promote disarmament .
Argumentative	 mutually assured destruction has become a far less secure strategy as nuclear proliferation has occurred to states with different strategic conceptions .
Argumentative	 this has been seen in the united states , which since its full adoption of the aegis system has actively pursued a policy of reaching a new accord with russia on nuclear arms reduction .
Argumentative	 this culminated inwith the signing of the new start , strategic arms reduction treaty , an accord to reduce the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers by half , associated press  .
Argumentative	 this new step toward nuclear disarmament could not be politically possible in the united states without a replacement defense , which only a national missile defense system can provide .
Argumentative	 an operational national missile defense system renders nuclear weapons , and intercontinental ballistic missiles generally , obsolete .
Argumentative	 when a country can shoot down all enemy missiles , those weapons lose their power .
Argumentative	 the future of war , once countries have access to the technology to build missile shields , will no longer be marked by fingers held over the proverbial red button .
Argumentative	 rather , the incentive for conflict between states armed with effective missile defenses will be to seek diplomatic solutions to problems .
Argumentative	 the technology will likely be in the hands of many nations very soon , as the united states has already provided the technology to japan and australia , and will be building defense batteries in romania from, mcmichael  .
Argumentative	 furthermore , even should war break out , they will necessarily be far less destructive , as they will not feature the city-leveling power of nuclear missiles .
Argumentative	 with missile defense , war will be less likely and , should it occur , less destructive .
