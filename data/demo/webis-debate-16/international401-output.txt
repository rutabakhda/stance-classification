Non-Argumentative	the united nations, formed out of the horrors of the world war ii with the overarching purpose of preventing this kind of total war from ever happening again.
Non-Argumentative	 its formation came after the failures of the league of nations, an international organisation that had the same lofty goal of preventing war.
Non-Argumentative	 the un sought out to overcome the leagues failures by through embedding itself into all aspects of the international community setting up organisations such as the general assembly, security council, international court of justice, the world bank, and later on the international atomic energy agency and its development programme.
Non-Argumentative	 over the lastyears, the un has changed and developed, along the way it has permanently changed the environment of the international community, through its work in peacekeeping, creating and developing international law, the establishment of human rights, the list goes on.
Non-Argumentative	 however, in all this change some negatives have arisen, the decision making process is often very slow and many institutions like the security council are reactionary, and very easily caught up in power politics, rendering them useless at critical moments.
Argumentative	 this raises the question that this debate is focused around- has the un failed?
Argumentative	the un was set up with the express purpose of preventing global wars , yet it has done absolutely nothing to prevent them .
Argumentative	 indeed , the un has often served merely as a forum for countries to abuse and criticise each other , rather than resolve disputes peacefully .
Argumentative	 in some cases , such as theinvasion of iraq , un resolutions have arguably been used as a justification for wars , rather than to prevent them .
Argumentative	 research shows that the number of armed conflicts in the world rose steadily in the years afterand has only begun to plateau or fall since the end of the cold war .
Argumentative	 despite the development of the concept of human rights in the post-war world , the un has totally failed to protect the rights of citizens , ethnic minorities , women and children .
Argumentative	 it has stood by during episodes of genocide in cambodia , rwanda , congo and yugoslavia among many others , tolerates some of the world 's worst dictatorships as members , and does nothing to improve the situation of women in developing nations .
Argumentative	 indeed , where un peacekeepers have been sent into war-torn countries , they have sometimes been guilty of the most horrendous human rights abuses themselves .
Argumentative	 as of, the un 's human rights council itself is comprised of members such as saudi arabia , cuba and china .
Argumentative	 the un displays all the worst traits of bureaucracies the world over .
Argumentative	 the general assembly is little more than a forum for world leaders and ambassadors to lambast each other .
Argumentative	 the security council is systemically unable to take decisive action in many of the world 's trouble-spots due to its outdated permanent membership structure , which gives five nations a totally disproportionate power to prevent the world body from acting against their interests .
Argumentative	 in the un 'syears , the veto has been used nearlytimes .
Argumentative	 as mentioned above , the human rights council consists of some the worst human rights abusers in the world .
Argumentative	 the ngo un watch has accused the hrc focusing almost exclusively on alleged human rights abuses by israel to the exclusion of almost every other country .
Argumentative	 there have been widespread allegations of corruption in un bodies .
Argumentative	 it is for these reasons that the us long refused to pay its full dues to the united nations and threatens to do so again in future , as well as withholding funding from unesco inafter it voted to recognise palestine as an independent state .
Argumentative	 the major economic , political and trade issues around the world are almost all dealt with either through bilateral agreements between nations or by specialised bodies set up for that purpose -- the world bank , imf , eu , asean , nato , wto and so on .
Argumentative	 in all of these fields the un is little more than an irrelevance .
Argumentative	 even where the un does get involved in international affairs -- such as in the libyan crisis of-- it is other bodies , in that case nato , which serve as the vehicle for international cooperation .
