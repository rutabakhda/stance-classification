Non-Argumentative	in the middle of the 1990s the formerly nationalised british rail was privatised.
Non-Argumentative	 the resulting franchise system has regularly been criticised for increasing prices, delays and bad service, as well as for the amount of state money that still goes into the system.
Non-Argumentative	 one area where there has been undoubted success, although privatisation may have nothing to do with it, is in the increasing usage of the railways.
Non-Argumentative	 the number of passenger journeys has doubled from 735million in 1994/5 to 1.5billion in 2012/3.
Non-Argumentative	 this huge increase has taken any excess capacity britain’s rail system had and lead to increasing problems with overcrowding.
Non-Argumentative	the answer from the coalition government has been ‘high speed two’ (hs2), with high speedhaving been the link to the channel tunnel from london.
Non-Argumentative	 the commitment to creating a high speed rail network was in their coalition agreement that outlined some of the policies the parties could agree on; in this case it was a merger of liberal democrat demands for a greener country and conservative opposition to the expansion of heathrow airport.
Non-Argumentative	at the end of decemberthe government started consultations on the route from london to birmingham and then breaking in two with one branch to manchester and another to leeds.
Non-Argumentative	 the government gave the go ahead for the first phase of the network to birmingham on 10th january 2012.
Non-Argumentative	 the intention is that this phase would be complete byand the second phase would finish construction a few years later inhaving been started slightly later.
Non-Argumentative	 the price tag was set as being £32.7billion.
Non-Argumentative	since its launch however things have not been going well for hs2, it has faced hostility from residents along the route, questions about whether it will deliver its touted benefits and whether it is the best route, judicial reviews and inflating costs.
Non-Argumentative	 just as seriously for a long term infrastructure project the opposition labour party has been increasingly sceptical with the shadow chancellor ed balls at the labour party conference declaring “under this government the high speed two project has been totally mismanaged and the costs have shot up to £50bn… labour will not take this irresponsible approach… there will be no blank cheque from me as a labour chancellor for this project or for any project.”
Non-Argumentative	 with labour almost certain to be in power at some point beforethe government clearly needs some backing from the opposition if the business community is to buy in.
Non-Argumentative	the government has also been slowly revising down the forecasted benefits of the high speed line; in its most recent report the benefits were lowered from £2.50 to £2.30 for every pound spent on the project, and this comes only a few days after reports that there would be many places around the country that would actually lose out as a result of the new line.
Non-Argumentative	 many people are not even convinced by the revised benefits and argue the money could be better spent elsewhere, either upgrading the existing network or even on areas that have nothing to do with railways.
Argumentative	 the uk has a north south divide in terms of wealth and income .
Argumentative	 london and the south east has for the last few decades done much better than the north ; while industry and mining in the north has declined financial services in the south have boomed .
Argumentative	 the result is inequality between regions .
Argumentative	 high speed two will help to solve this inequality by increasing connections between north and south .
Argumentative	 the government `` suggests that hs2 could provide a boost to the birmingham city region equivalent to between 2.1 % and 4.2 % of its gdp .
Argumentative	 for the manchester city region the figure is 0.8 % -1.7 % , for the leeds city region 1.6 % '' .
Argumentative	 this is because businesses will be more likely to invest there when there is better infrastructure , companies based in london in particular will be much more likely to see the benefits of investing in , or partnering with businesses in the north when they can easily reach those cities .
Argumentative	 capacity on the railways is a big problem in the uk .
Argumentative	 due to growth since privatisation britain 's railways take as many passengers as it is physically possible to do ; more than a fifth of rush hour passengers have to stand .
Argumentative	 growth is almost certain to continue as the roads too are at capacity and population continues to rise .
Argumentative	 the result is more railways are needed .
Argumentative	 rail freight meanwhile if forecast to double by the 2040s .
Argumentative	 the west coast main line is a particular bottleneck for freight with% of uk freight services using the line ; any increase would have to come at the expense of passenger services .
Argumentative	 transferring the main rail services to the high speed line would free up the wcml to increased freight and commuter use so hs2 would not just mean an increase in long distance capacity .
Argumentative	 the united kingdom has been somewhat of a laggard when it comes to high speed rail .
Argumentative	 in the first half of the century britain 's railways were the fastest in the world , still holding the world speed record for steam .
Argumentative	 but since what we would now consider to be high speed started with the launch of the shinkansen inthe uk has only marginally upgraded its own railways to 125mph .
Argumentative	 this means the only high speed line the uk has is the link to the channel tunnel which does not serve a large number of internal passengers .
Argumentative	 the uk therefore has 113km of high speed rail againstin germany ,in italy ,in france andin spain .
Argumentative	 even much smaller countries such as the netherlands and belgium have longer high speed lines .
Argumentative	 big infrastructure projects often provide a big boost to the economy .
Argumentative	 hs2 will do this in two ways ; the first will be in the economic activity created in building the line and the estimatedjobs staffing the railway .
Argumentative	 much more important however are the wider economic benefits .
Argumentative	 on a cost-benefit basis hs2 is considered to be ` high value for money ' because it will have a 1:2.3 cost : benefit ratio .
Argumentative	 this ration however could be considerably better if ridership keeps increasing for longer or faster than expected .
Argumentative	 the overall benefit to the economy is estimated at #billion .
Argumentative	 the most obvious benefit from high speed rail is that journey times will be less .
Argumentative	 from london the journey to birmingham will be reduced fromtominutes , leeds fromtoand manchesterto.
Argumentative	 while faster journeys provide some economic benefit the are as much a social benefit of making more places accessible by allowing individuals to spend less time traveling and more doing what they want to when they get there .
