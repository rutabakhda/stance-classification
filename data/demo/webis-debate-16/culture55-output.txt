Non-Argumentative	in a landmark ruling, the us supreme court ruled 6-3 in vernonia school district v. acton that schools could randomly test student athletes for drug use, after a student, james acton, was banned from trialling for his school football team without consenting to a test.
Non-Argumentative	 the legal battle for the school’s right to drug-test has gained and lost ground for many years in the usa; inthe united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in todd v. rush county schools  upheld an indiana school board program that banned students from participation in extracurricular activities without first passing a random drugs test.
Non-Argumentative	 this was however later struck down as being against state constitutional law.
Non-Argumentative	 and inthe tenth circuit in willis v. anderson community school corporation ruled that tests imposed unreasonable searches upon students in violation of fourth amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Non-Argumentative	a study conducted in the united kingdom inby the independent inquiry into drug testing at work found that attempts by employers to force employees to take drug tests could potentially be challenged as a violation of privacy under the uk human rights act and articleof the european convention of human rights.
Non-Argumentative	this should focus on society’s desire to combat what it perceives as a growing drug abuse problem, pitted against children and families’ right to privacy.
Non-Argumentative	 tests can be conducted on urine, hair, breath or occasionally blood.
Argumentative	 there is a clear and present problem with drug use among children and teenagers in many countries .
Argumentative	 according to the uk department of health , in 2002-2003% ofyear olds had used illegal drugs , as had% ofyear olds .
Argumentative	 the fact that all of these children would have been in schools at the age ofshows that current policies of targeting the supply train of drugs , for example by arresting drug dealers and intercepting drug shipments , is failing to protect children .
Argumentative	 therefore a more direct approach that intervenes at the point of consumption is needed , most crucially for children and teenagers , as their years in education are crucial for both their personal development and their realization of their future education and employment potential .
Argumentative	 drug use at a young age may lead to lifelong use and addiction .
Argumentative	 random drug testing in schools will allow for vulnerable children 's drug problems to be discovered , and assist the state in getting them the help they need to get off drugs .
Argumentative	 random testing is especially valuable in this scenario because many infant and teenage drug users will try to disguise their drug use from parents and teachers and so avoid detection through avoiding suspicion , a tactic which will prove of no use against random drug tests which will likely affect all students at one point or another .
Argumentative	 it should also deter many students from starting taking drugs in the first place as the prospect of them being caught becomes far more likely , as they know disguising their drug use will be of no use .
Argumentative	 peer pressure drives most drug use among children and teenagers .
Argumentative	 the fact that the state requires all children to be engaged in education means that most of them will be gathered into large groups in schools for most of the day , five days a week , essentially creating the necessary conditions for peer pressure to take place and be powerful .
Argumentative	 this occurs as some children face ostracism or exclusion from their peers in the social environment that the state compels them to be in if they refuse to take illegal drugs , if drug use is deemed necessary to be ` cool ' or ` popular ' .
Argumentative	 it is , generally , the state that operates a western liberal democracy 's education system .
Argumentative	 under circumstances in which children are placed into the care of the state , and are made vulnerable to peer pressure the state has a duty to ensure that children are not coerced into using drugs .
Argumentative	 this means that concerns of ` privacy ' are secondary to protecting the choice not to take drugs , as ensuring the ` privacy ' of all students by not having random drug tests empowers some students to socially coerce other students into using drugs when they otherwise would not .
Argumentative	 random drug tests help prevent cultures or norms of drug-taking , by which it can become the ` cool ' thing to do , by ensuring that most drug users will be caught and helped to quit , thus protecting the choice of others not to be pressured into drug use .
Argumentative	 random drug tests will pose no harm to students who do not use illegal drugs , as they have nothing to fear from this fact being certified .
Argumentative	 if anything it serves as a vindication of their law-abidance and good character .
Argumentative	 random drug tests will only catch those who are actively taking drugs , as tests can be used which are unlikely to make a ` positive ' reading from secondary exposure , for example , being near someone else smoking cannabis .
Argumentative	 those actively taking drugs need help in getting off drugs far more urgently than they need their right to ` privacy ' , as addiction at a young age could have a significant negative impact upon the remainder of their time in education .
Argumentative	 therefore , non-drug users have nothing to fear from testing .
Argumentative	 as a result random checks are in the best interests of drug users .
