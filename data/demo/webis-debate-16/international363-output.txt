Non-Argumentative	there is only one china, but which is it?
Non-Argumentative	 there are two chinas, the people’s republic of china and the republic of china (taiwan) but because both accept there is only one china all states need to decide which they recognise as china.
Non-Argumentative	at the end of the second world war there were two main factions in china; the communists (cpc) under mao tse-tung and the nationalists (kmt) of chang kai-shek.
Non-Argumentative	 these two groups had already been fighting prior to the interruption of their conflict by the japanese invasion of china.
Non-Argumentative	 despite some cooperation during the second world war the civil war resumed insoon after japan was defeated.
Non-Argumentative	  the communist chinese won several important victories in 1948-9 and captured the kmt capital nanjing.
Non-Argumentative	 on december 10thchang retreated to the island of taiwan.
Non-Argumentative	 the cpc lacked the amphibious capacity to invade the island.
Non-Argumentative	 and in junethe korean war began bringing renewed us interest in asia with the us 7th fleet moving to the taiwan strait making any invasion impossible.
Non-Argumentative	the people’s republic of china was proclaimed on the 1st october 1949; the kmt however made taipei their new capital and refused to give in.
Non-Argumentative	 the result was therefore two regimes both claiming to be the sole legitimate government of china.
Non-Argumentative	 both sides claim the entire territory of china, not just that which they occupy.
Non-Argumentative	 communist countries, along with some non-aligned countries such as india quickly changed their diplomatic recognition to beijing.
Non-Argumentative	 most western countries however continued to recognise taipei.
Non-Argumentative	this changed in 1971-2 with a sudden thaw in relations between the us and the people’s republic.
Non-Argumentative	 first secretary of state kissinger and then president nixon travelled to beijing showing that the usa would no longer oppose those who have good relations with the prc helping to precipitate a large number of countries changing their recognition from roc to prc.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states itself did not change recognition until 1st januaryas a result of lobbying by the ‘taiwan lobby’ and concerns over jeopardising détente with the ussr.
Non-Argumentative	 since the us change however taiwan has been rapidly losing diplomatic support to the people’s republic.
Non-Argumentative	only three nations in africa currently recognise taiwan: são tomé and príncipe, burkina faso, and swaziland.
Non-Argumentative	 this is out of a total of twenty-two countries that recognise taiwan all of which are comparatively small states with the biggest being guatemala (in terms of population)and paraguay (in terms of area).
Non-Argumentative	 but with china playing an increasing role in africa, and the world more generally it is increasingly a question how long the remaining countries will hold out their recognition of taiwan.
Non-Argumentative	n.b. most of these arguments work for any of the countries that recognise taiwan, and indeed it might also be used for a debate about the gambia which has only recently cut ties with taiwan and has yet to fully recognise the prc.
Non-Argumentative	for the purposes of this debate i will use prc, beijing, and chinese for the people’s republic, and roc, taipei, and taiwanese for the republic of china.
Non-Argumentative	 when “china” is mentioned it is as either the territory, or the dispute.
Argumentative	 the chinese civil war is over , and it is clear that it is the people 's republic that has won .
Argumentative	 theconsensus , though the term was coined later , between taiwan and the prc is that there is `` one china , different interpretations '' about who controls that china .
Argumentative	 if there is only one china then it is clear which of the two china 's that one is .
Argumentative	 the prc istimes larger than roc , hastimes the population , and its economy is 13.7 times bigger , by purchasing power parity .
Argumentative	 states should be recognising the prc as the `` one china '' .
Argumentative	 switching diplomatic recognition to china can be economically beneficial .
Argumentative	 a country that changes recognition is both likely to be given a reward for the change and then be much capable of engaging in joint economic projects with the prc .
Argumentative	 malawi for example cut its ties with taiwan at the end of.
Argumentative	 prc offered a $ 6billion financial package for the defection .
Argumentative	 malawi has since benefited from large amounts of chinese investment ; chinese companies have been involved in building vital infrastructure such as schools and roads , and even a new parliament building .
Argumentative	 and trade between china and malawi has been booming with growth of% inalone .
Argumentative	 even the chinese believe that recognition occurs as a result of the economic incentive the chinese envoy to malawi having been quoted calling malawi beggars .
Argumentative	 a small african country should not ignore one sixth of the world 's population .
Argumentative	 to recognise a tiny country of 23million over one of 1.3 billion is being unjust to a huge portion of humanity .
Argumentative	 when there is such an imbalance in population it is clear that the democratic path is to recognise the side with the greater population .
Argumentative	 when all the states that have recognised taiwan finally transfer recognition to the prc taiwan may finally recognise that it would be best off returning to china .
Argumentative	 by changing its recognition são tomé and other small countries can do their bit to ensure peace in east asia .
Argumentative	 the prc is a member of the united nations security council and as such is one of the key members of the un .
Argumentative	 it is therefore difficult for countries to avoid dealing with it .
Argumentative	 the pacific island of tonga 's switched recognition because it feared the prc would veto its membership of the un .
Argumentative	 são tomé is already a member but that does not mean the prc ca n't cause problems in the international body ; it clearly has the ability to scupper any initiative são tomé wishes to pursue .
Argumentative	 similarly in other international institutions while the prc does not wield as much power as it does in the un it still has considerably more influence than taiwan ; this includes over some organisations that provide aid such as the world bank and imf .
Argumentative	 são tomé therefore must deal with the prc , this being the case it should not let recognition get in the way .
