Non-Argumentative	as our knowledge of surgical and diagnostic techniques has increased with time, so has the success rate of organ transplants.
Non-Argumentative	 however, the number of patients who require organ transplants exceeds the number of organs available, particularly if the patient has a rare blood type or belongs to an ethnic minority where organ donations are even lower than normal.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, although black people are three times more likely than the general population to develop kidney failure, and the asian community has a particularly high demand for organs, organ donation within these groups is relatively low.
Non-Argumentative	 it is important for the donor and recipient to have the same blood type and similar genetic make-up in order to minimize the change of the receiver’s body rejecting the organ.
Non-Argumentative	 more than 10,000 people in the uk currently need a transplant, and 1,000 people die every year while on the waiting list.
Non-Argumentative	 in the us, over 100,000 people are still on the waiting list.
Non-Argumentative	 although these figures are astonishing in themselves, the genuine figure is probably higher, inflated by the deaths of patients who are never waitlisted for a transplant.
Non-Argumentative	 some patients are never placed on the waiting list because they have certain habits – such as smoking – and the precious few organs available are prioritised for patients who fit recipient categories.
Non-Argumentative	the sale of human organs offers a possible solution to this crippling shortage of organs.
Non-Argumentative	 there is already an established black market trade in organs.
Non-Argumentative	 entrepreneurs offer british and western patients the opportunity to receive privately financed transplants in countries such as india and malaysia.
Non-Argumentative	 in 2006, investigators discovered that chinese hospitals were providing organ transplants using the organs of executed prisoners.
Non-Argumentative	 in 1983, dr. barry jacobs requested that the us government should create a fund to compensate the families who donate the organs of their deceased relatives.
Non-Argumentative	 he also proposed a business plan to buy kidneys from living donors to transplant to american patients.
Non-Argumentative	 however, these is still plenty of opposition to these ideas, and the national organ transplantation act ofstill prohibits the sale of human organs from both dead and living donors.
Non-Argumentative	the proposition line could argue that organs are the property of the donors, and so they have a right to do with them as they wish.
Non-Argumentative	 in this case of buying human organs, it is much easier to argue that the profits would go to the donor rather than (for example) hospitals or governments which may not have a vested interest in those concerned.
Non-Argumentative	 it would be useful to outline in the mechanism that these organs will be transferred through a unique medical group or business which has the technology available to match up donors to potential recipients and so avoid potential medical complications as far as possible.
Non-Argumentative	 after this, it would be like any other financial transaction.
Non-Argumentative	 this will focus on the united kingdom, but the arguments would be relevant to most countries considering this policy change.
Argumentative	 the ethics of private healthcare are not in question here ; indeed , the uk government has stated that as many people as possible should be encouraged to pay for private healthcare in order to relieve the strain on national resources .
Argumentative	 critics have understood this as the government prolonging waiting lists until the patients ` remove themselves ' either by going private , or dying .
Argumentative	 there is , however , a general understanding that the nhs in the uk is overburdened and that increased private healthcare would help to balance this .
Argumentative	 meanwhile , in the us , private healthcare is the norm .
Argumentative	 allowing the sale of organs is merely an extension of this principle and provides utilitarian benefit .
Argumentative	 not only would those who are able to pay for an organ enjoy a much better chance at recovery , but there would be more time , space , and resources for the people who could not afford to do this privately .
Argumentative	 legalisation can help to eliminate the corruption currently associated with the organ market .
Argumentative	 it can also make it easy to regulate , and so safer .
Argumentative	 given the mystery of the black market , medical complications are much more likely ; it is necessary to match the donor and recipient together , but this can not be easily done when every step of the organ collection and donation must be hidden for fear of prosecution .
Argumentative	 legalisation could also stop the ` theft ' or organs and abuse of people like chinese prisoners who are currently exploited for their organs -- authorities will become accountable to a publicly recognised and enforced system .
Argumentative	 the proposition is not concerned with live people trying to donate their hearts , or other vital organs which they can not live without .
Argumentative	 no matter how impoverished that person might be , they will not choose certain death for a cash payoff .
Argumentative	 however , organs like kidneys , and sections of liver , can be and often are donated from a live donor without significant lasting damage .
Argumentative	 it is patronising to forbid an individual to sell or donate an organ when it is possible for them to live without it .
Argumentative	 similarly , the family of a deceased relative , as next of kin , should have the right to receive financial remuneration from their organs .
Argumentative	 given that the doctors , nurses and surgeons who work around organ transplants are all paid , it is nonsensical that the donor , the most important figure in the organ transplant , should be left out .
Argumentative	 the united states already allows markets for sperm , blood , human eggs and surrogate wombs .
Argumentative	 there is no good reason why organs should be excluded when these other human products are not ; there is no moral difference between a kidney and an ovum .
Argumentative	 moreover , organ donation is a lifesaving process , whereas sperm and egg donation are not .
Argumentative	 simply put , incentivizing donations through payment will save the lives of many patients in need .
Argumentative	 the payment from these organs could also hugely improve the quality of life of the donors by lifting them out of debt , or allowing struggling individuals , such as students , to improve their career potential by paying for their university fees .
