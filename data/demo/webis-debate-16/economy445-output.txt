Non-Argumentative	governments often face a dilemma wherein the public wants more services but also to pay less tax.
Non-Argumentative	 both are beneficial to the nation’s economy; the more a government invests in education, health care, and other services, the more productive its population will be.
Non-Argumentative	 however, lower taxation allows individuals to invest more money, thereby allowing more business growth.
Non-Argumentative	 governments often try to resolve this dilemma through temporary budget deficits, which as these deficits can be difficult to reduce and pay back often lead to long-term debt.
Non-Argumentative	 relatively large deficits are often essential in the short term due to the government being a last resort for stabilizing the economy and encouraging growth.
Non-Argumentative	 when in a crisis the government has to step in, as happened inwhen britain and ireland bailed out their banking sectors.
Non-Argumentative	  governments also need to have a certain amount of debt in order to function as they need to be able to raise short term loans in order to make up for taxes not consistently coming in on time.
Non-Argumentative	 however many governments, particularly in europe, have found that their debt levels are getting too high.
Non-Argumentative	 the highest debts in europe are greece whose debts are 165% of gdp (gdp is the output of a nation so equivalent to comparing debt to income), italy 120%, ireland 107% and portugal 103% but the major european powers also have high debts france’s national debt is at 86% of gdp, germany at 82% and the uk at 80%.
Non-Argumentative	the eurozone has been facing a sovereign debt crisis since the end of 2009, on 1st maygreece was bailed out for the first time with a €110 billion loan, followed being given a €67.5 billion bailout on the 29th november.
Non-Argumentative	 portugal was the next state needing a bail out and it received a €78 billion bailout on the 16th may 2011.
Non-Argumentative	 the causes of each government’s difficulties were different, irelands was originally caused by a property bubble, greece’s by poor accounting and generous pay and pensions and portugal through mismanagement of public investment.
Non-Argumentative	 however all caused the same concern of ‘financial contagion’ where financial crisis in one country can spread quickly to other countries due to the interconnectedness of the financial system.
Non-Argumentative	 so for example italy owes french banks €309 billion, if it were to default on these debts these french banks will then likely need bailouts from the french government that in turn may have difficulties raising enough money.
Non-Argumentative	 all of these bailouts had conditions attached, mostly austerity to get budget deficits under control.
Non-Argumentative	 however at the moment in europe austerity is the norm and even countries that have not been bailed out have been following pushing through austerity governments.
Non-Argumentative	 these measures are accompanied by considerable criticism and debate about the necessity of the measures, whether cuts are too far and too fast and even if cuts are needed at all.
Non-Argumentative	 debates concerning the benefits of a balanced budget include both economic arguments- the extent to which debt can help/harm a nation- as well as moral issues about a government’s place in society.
Non-Argumentative	 while this debate is focused on europe it also draws in examples from other countries around the world.

Argumentative	  government bonds compete with private company bonds .
Argumentative	 furthermore , government bonds are often more reliable than private bonds , the uk for example prides itself on having never defaulted , thereby giving the government an additional advantage over private companies .
Argumentative	 this is especially the case in a financial crisis or economic downturn where there are worries about the creditworthiness of companies .
Argumentative	 crowding out creates a vicious cycle ; less investment in the private sector leads to less growth , thereby increasing the need for government programs , which increases the need for government spending and more government bonds on the market .
Argumentative	 italy 's current debt exemplifies the problem with compiling debt by running even small deficits over a long period .
Argumentative	 italy 's budget deficit is low at 3.9 % of gdp inless than france 's 5.3 % , and even has a primary budget surplus , before the interest payments on debt is included .
Argumentative	 italy 's crisis is not new with its debt having breached% of gdp two decades ago in.
Argumentative	 the problem is that this high debt makes italy very vulnerable to economic shocks .
Argumentative	 it can not afford to , for example , bail out banks or increase welfare and spending to boost the economy .
Argumentative	 italy 's credit rating in the 1990s was the highest rating , triple a , it has since declined to a + .
Argumentative	 as this rating shows how likely governments are perceived to be to default declines in credit ratings mean declines in confidence and increases in interest rates .
Argumentative	 if investors lose confidence and interest rates on its debts rise then it will be paying much more of its budget simply to repay loans .
Argumentative	 if interest rates rise by% italy would have to pay an extra $ 38bn over three years .
Argumentative	 large debts are therefore not sustainable and reduce the ability of the government to pay for other things .
Argumentative	 japan , whose national debt stands at% of gdp , has accumulated debt partially due to social programs for its aging population .
Argumentative	 today , japan struggles merely to make interest payments on its debt , thereby preventing it from directing its funds towards reducing the debt itself .
Argumentative	 europe has the same problem , albeit in a less severe form .
Argumentative	 once government entitlement programs are established , they are very difficult to get eliminate .
Argumentative	 once these programs become unaffordable , the government finds itself in a situation of perpetual debt that it can not get out of .
Argumentative	 this is a particular problem in europe as the continent is aging .
Argumentative	 every member of the european union has an aging population .
Argumentative	 encouraging economic growth in countries that are old and getting older is difficult because they are less inclined to take risks and be innovative .
Argumentative	 while growth and thus tax take slows the costs to the government will rise due to increasing healthcare costs and pensions .
Argumentative	 thus , a balanced budget must be a government 's first priority .
Argumentative	 excess government debt can have devastating consequences for a nation 's population .
Argumentative	 for example , when germany lost wwi and was forced to pay reparations it could not afford it resolved its debt through hyperinflation which devastated civilians ' savings .
Argumentative	 although this is an extreme example , governments must default , make big raises in tax rates , print more money , or otherwise manipulate currency in order to resolve debt crises .
Argumentative	 when individuals go into debt , they suffer the consequences themselves .
Argumentative	 when government leaders decide to have an unbalanced budget , the entire country suffers for their mistakes .
Argumentative	 the government is abandoning its duty to do what is best for its people when it gets too far into debt .
Argumentative	 it is not right for governments to take such risks that can have such devastating effects .
