Non-Argumentative	this first of all makes the assumption that a strike against terrorists is going to be made.
Non-Argumentative	 the debate is therefore not focused on whether there should be military action to strike at terrorists but whether we should be using unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs), sometimes called drones, in order to strike at these targets.
Non-Argumentative	 uav’s have a wide variety of uses and capabilities ranging from reconnaissance to research and development but are best known for their use by the united states in attacking suspected terrorist targets.
Non-Argumentative	 the uavs used primarily for this purpose are the mq1 predators and the mq9 reapers.
Non-Argumentative	 the more advanced reaper has a payload of 3,000 pounds allowing it to carry up tohellfire missiles and it can stay airborne forhours giving its operators plenty of time to confirm the target and choose the ideal time to attack.
Non-Argumentative	  on 3rd novemberthe first uav attack outside a theatre of war took place to kill suspected al qaeda terrorists in yemen.
Non-Argumentative	 strikes by uavs in pakistan, where they have been most controversial, started on 17th junein an attack that killed a local taliban commander nek mohammed and up to four other alleged taliban however it also resulted in the deaths of two children.
Non-Argumentative	 since then there have been aboutstrikes by uavs in pakistan, yemen, and somalia.
Argumentative	 there are only two things that really matter when targeting terrorists ; is the terrorist eliminated , and is collateral damage kept to a minimum ?
Argumentative	 in pakistan there have been a total ofstrikes by uavs betweenand junewith the total reported killed at 2496-3202 of which only 482-832 were civilians according to the bureau of investigative journalism .
Argumentative	 moreover the number of civilians killed in strikes is falling ;percent of casualties inwere civilians but bythis had fallen topercent and this is a figure that is likely to continue falling as drones improve technologically making identification easier and making strikes more precise .
Argumentative	 these figures show that the united states in its use of drones is not only hitting a lot of terrorist targets and eliminating them but is causing very little collateral damage in comparison to the number of strikes made .
Argumentative	 we need to eliminate terrorists somehow and uavs are the best possible equipment with which to carry out this mission .
Argumentative	 all the other options either would result in significantly more casualties or would have other problems that would likely allow terrorists to escape .
Argumentative	 first there is the collateral damage that would be caused by using other alternatives to striking terrorists .
Argumentative	 professor plaw of the university of massachusetts says that when terrorists were being confronted by the pakistani army , who were attacking at the behest of the united states ,% of casualties were collateral damage .
Argumentative	 a similar number of% was the figure when israel was targeting hamas .
Argumentative	 when compared to theor% collateral damage figures for uavs the choice should be easy .
Argumentative	 moreover other options have other disadvantages .
Argumentative	 sending a hit squad in to eliminate terrorists may mean little collateral damage but would cause a diplomatic crisis as it would be tantamount to invading another country .
Argumentative	 using a missile or local support on the other hand significantly increases the chances of the target escaping .
Argumentative	 pakistan 's isi , military intelligence , has for example been accused of helping the taliban -- they could hardly be trusted to kill them .
Argumentative	 when engaging in covert operations it is essential that the right target is identified so that the correct target is eliminated .
Argumentative	 this is something that using uavs allows as they are able to track their target , sometimes for days , before attacking .
Argumentative	 this means there is much more time for scrutiny of targets and possible collateral damage .
Argumentative	 this also means that there is plenty of room for the decisions to be made right at the top .
Argumentative	 every person on the kill list gets discussed at a weekly meeting of more thanmembers of the us government 's security apparatus .
Argumentative	 president obama himself signs off on strikes and can change the decision if the situation on the ground changes .
Argumentative	 former national security advisor jones says `` many times ... at the 11th hour we waved off a mission simply because the target had people around them and we were able to loiter on station until they did n't . ''
Argumentative	 while uavs may be ` unmanned ' they are certainly heavily monitored as each drone hasmilitary personnel rotating in three shifts .
Argumentative	 they include seven joystick pilots , seven system operators , and five mission coordinators , there is also from the ciapeople , includingvideo crew members , andintelligence analysts .
Argumentative	 this means that there are a large number of eyeballs to make sure that the right person is being targeted , to check he is with as few others as possible before the strike .
Argumentative	 none of this would be possible with other forms of attack where the emphasis has to be on the speed of the operation .
Argumentative	 to put it bluntly any military or intelligence service wants to keep its own men safe while carrying out its missions ; unmanned aerial vehicles are the ultimate capability with which to manage this .
Argumentative	 no military or civilian personnel are going to be killed if the delivery vehicle is controlled from the united states .
Argumentative	 this means that unlike in other methods of attack the uav can take its time even if it is at risk .
Argumentative	 in the war in kosovo nato air forces had to launch their attacks from 15,000 feet due to worries they would be shot down .
Argumentative	 attacking from such a height from a fast moving aeroplane makes missing the target much more likely .
