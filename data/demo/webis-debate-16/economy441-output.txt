Non-Argumentative	in the past two decades the internet has come to be a dominant part of people’s lives.
Non-Argumentative	 for work, pleasure, staying in touch, and countless other uses, the internet has become an indispensable tool for many individuals.
Non-Argumentative	 without it, much of the information-based civilization that has been built up would stop working the way we are accustomed to.
Non-Argumentative	 as the internet has become more important so too have access to the most cutting-edge systems to provide high speed, security, and data storage become critical.
Non-Argumentative	 broadband internet provides the fastest access to the internet, and is now essential to the functioning of the economy both globally and locally.
Non-Argumentative	the increased importance of the internet has spurred a significant debate over the nature of the rights to access it.
Non-Argumentative	 is internet access now a fundamental right because it is a critical tool in the expression of other freedoms such as the freedom of expression?
Non-Argumentative	 as yet there is no consensus on an answer.
Non-Argumentative	 the united nations special rapporteur on the freedom of expression has stated “given that the internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the internet should be a priority for all states.”
Non-Argumentative	 many countries, including france, costa rica, spain, and greece have all legally enshrined the right to internet access.
Non-Argumentative	 most countries have not yet followed suit, though vigorous debate flourishes in many polities, such as the united states and united kingdom.
Non-Argumentative	if internet access is a human right, or even recognised simply as being important for everyone to have, then how should it be ensured that everyone has access?
Non-Argumentative	 some suggest that governments have a duty to provide service through monopolies run by state companies, and that these services would be more efficient than private provision.
Non-Argumentative	 others say it is the place of the private sector to provide these services, and that it is always the private sector, absent state bureaucracy, that provides the superior service, especially if the state were to make provisions to guarantee service to everyone.
Non-Argumentative	this seeks to piece out the case for each side by examining the rights to internet, the risks state provision entails, and the relative cost savings or accruals from state internet providers.
Non-Argumentative	 for the sake of this debate it is worthwhile to limit the scope to the developed world, where the possibility of providing extensive broadband service is a realistic policy.
Argumentative	 as information technology has come more and more to pervade people 's lives , it has become abundantly clear that a new set of positive rights must be considered .
Argumentative	 in the forefront of this consideration stands broadband .
Argumentative	 broadband allows for far more rapid access to the internet , and thus access to the world of information the internet represents .
Argumentative	 today , a citizen of a free society must be able to access the internet if he or she is to be able to fully realise their potential .
Argumentative	 this is because the ability to access the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and civic and social participation are now contingent upon ready access to the internet .
Argumentative	 thus access to the internet has itself become a right of citizens , and their access should be guaranteed by the state .
Argumentative	 this right has been enshrined by several countries , such as france , finland , greece , and spain , thus leading the way toward a more general recognition of this service as a right in the same way other public services are guaranteed .
Argumentative	 it is a right derived from the evolution of society in the same fashion that the right to healthcare has grown out of countries ' social and economic development .
Argumentative	 a single , universal provider of broadband would allow the government to rationalize the management and development of the service .
Argumentative	 multiple private service-providers ultimately end up causing three serious problems .
Argumentative	 the first two are straightforward , that private firms competing in the same area waste money creating multiple distribution channels that are unnecessary for the number of consumers , and that when they opt not to compete they end up dividing up territory into effective utility monopolies .
Argumentative	 the third problem is especially salient to the state when it is attempting to provide for everyone : many areas are too sparsely populated or economically underdeveloped that private firms are unwilling to invest in them ; these areas are entirely dependent on state intervention to allow them to get broadband access .
Argumentative	 thus for example , in the united statesmillion people in the united states still have no broadband access .
Argumentative	 much like electrical and water utilities , a single provider can create the most efficient outcome for consumers , and when that provider is the state it can guarantee affordable prices and commit to not price-gouging as private firms are wont to do .
Argumentative	 broadband should be treated as a utility , and the state has always proven to be the best purveyor of public utilities .
Argumentative	 information technology is critical to the success of contemporary economies , with even the simplest business ventures .
Argumentative	 uneven or non-existent penetration of broadband is a major drag on economic progress .
Argumentative	 the private sector has been unable to effectively adapt with a holistic approach to the provision of data space and internet speed .
Argumentative	 the state providing these services would guarantee a high quality of service , and penetration across the country , linking all citizens to the network .
Argumentative	 for a country to compete internationally it needs broadband , and the surest way to provide it , since the private sector has resolutely failed to do so , and where it does provide services , it tends to overcharge .
Argumentative	 as the western world is left behind by the internet speeds of erstwhile developing states like singapore , which has almost total penetration of high quality , state-sponsored broadband , it needs to refocus on what can reverse the trend .
Argumentative	 broadband is one of the steps toward the solution .
Argumentative	 advanced infrastructure technology often relies on the existence of broadband technology universally installed across the grid .
Argumentative	 countries like south korea and japan have succeeded in expanding their power grids by means of `` smart grids '' , power-grids that are far more efficient than existing structures in previously leading states like the united states , that make use of the broadband network in the provision of power .
Argumentative	 the us government has since committed to creating its own new grid , one that would increase efficiency , supply and management , and lower costs of energy provision to its citizens .
Argumentative	 such grids depend on the reliable and advanced broadband networks .
Argumentative	 the incentive for states to employ broadband across their territory is tremendous , beyond mere access to fast internet .
Argumentative	 this is why private firms will never be sufficient in efficient provision of broadband , because they do not reap all the benefits directly of the smart grid that can arise from its development .
Argumentative	 the state providing broadband is an essential part of upgrading energy provision for advanced countries in the 21st century .
