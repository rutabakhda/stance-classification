Non-Argumentative	mexican journalist carmen aristegui was fired for publicly calling on president felipe calderón to clarify rumours that he suffered from alcoholism, writes felipe correa.
Non-Argumentative	 allegations that politicians have problems with alcohol are common but rarely evidence-based, leading often to libel.
Non-Argumentative	 however, in the case that occurred in mexico it seems to me that the journalist was just commenting on an act that happened in the mexican congress, and asking for clarification from the president.
Non-Argumentative	 commenting on an event occurring in congress is different from claiming something in an investigative story.
Non-Argumentative	 in the case of rother, he did not report an event.
Non-Argumentative	 he did an investigation and wrote a story insinuating (giving no evidences, but rumours) that the brazilian president suffered from alcoholism.
Non-Argumentative	 in the case of aristegui, it is clear to me that it was not defamation and she shouldn’t have been dismissed- felipe correa debaters’ notethis is one specific example of a very common type of debate referred to as ‘public figures / private lives’.
Non-Argumentative	 it is also a huge issue in discussions about freedom of speech and the independence of the press.
Non-Argumentative	 if a politician is an alcoholic, or having an affair, or is gay, or takes drugs or a million other things does the public have any right to know?
Non-Argumentative	 more to the point in this case, if it is just gossip is there a public interest in it being more widely known that such gossip is taking place in political and journalistic circles?
Non-Argumentative	usually the issue comes down to whether;a)    the politician is being a hypocrite – backing homophobic legislation while at the same time living with a gay partner.
Non-Argumentative	b)    the issue is affecting the politician’s performance at work – missing meetings because she is drunk or hungover.
Non-Argumentative	c)    there is a possibility that the politician could be threatened with the release of the information – either though blackmail or internal political horse-trading.
Non-Argumentative	 it’s worth noting, the allegation doesn’t really need to be true for this to be a threat.
Non-Argumentative	d)    finally, can the journalist prove that there is a matter of public interest.
Non-Argumentative	 remember that the public interest is something much more than the public just being curious about a scandal – it means that there is a provable reason for revealing the information.
Argumentative	in the light of this, these arguments have been kept deliberately broad but are set within the confines of the case set out above.
Argumentative	the fact that by doing so she endangered not only her own reputation with the president 's office but that of the show and the company clearly makes it a disciplinary matter .
Argumentative	 intruding on anyone 's private life unnecessarily is unpleasant invading the privacy of a figure with whom one is likely to need to work in the future is professional stupidity .
Argumentative	 opposition parties in every democracy in the world produce stories or actions calling on those in power to do or say something ridiculous or making unfounded allegations just to get some coverage and damage their opponent 's credibility .
Argumentative	 viewers and readers expect journalist to use their professional judgement in choosing where to give real stories the oxygen of publicity and when to ignore something as a publicity stunt .
Argumentative	 unfurling banners in parliament is clearly the latter .
Argumentative	 as a result journalists are able to present their audience with something they have good reason to believe is true .
Argumentative	 instead aristegui , effectively , came up with `` well , some people said these , it might be true , it might not , someone should find out . ''
Argumentative	 that ` someone ' should have been her .
Argumentative	 by mentioning this at all on air , the rumour is given credibility that it did not deserve and the president 's reputation was unfairly sullied .
Argumentative	 all of these things were well known by the journalists of their time but there was no need for the story to be revealed .
Argumentative	 the allegation of the opposition was that calderón was a drunk , this then became a suggestion that he was an alcoholic -- they 're different things .
Argumentative	 this rather suggests that now research at all was undertaken into the allegation but that a slur was repeated as though it were news .
