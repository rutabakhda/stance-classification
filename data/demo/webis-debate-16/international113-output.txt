Non-Argumentative	the war in darfur refers to the civil war taking place in darfur, sudan.
Non-Argumentative	 unlike the second sudanese civil war, this is believed to be an ethnic, rather than a religious war, though it has racial overtones and grew out of the existing sudanese civil war.
Non-Argumentative	the people of darfur occupied an equivocal position in that other conflict.
Non-Argumentative	 like the southerners they are black.
Non-Argumentative	 like the northern government and unlike their racial counterparts in the south, they are muslim.
Non-Argumentative	 they largely sided with the northern forces in the civil war, but as the north moved towards a peace agreement, the darfur tribes increasingly began to resent the neglect which they felt khartoum showed to their influence.
Non-Argumentative	 in february ofthey rose against the government,rather than making concessions, the sudanese government sent in military forces.
Non-Argumentative	 one side of the armed conflicts is composed mainly of the sudanese military and the janjaweed, a sudanese militia group recruited mostly from the afro-arab abbala tribes of the northern rizeigat region in sudan.
Non-Argumentative	 these tribes are mainly camel-herding nomads.
Non-Argumentative	 the other side is composed of rebel groups, notably the sudan liberation movement/army and the justice and equality movement, recruited primarily from the non-arab fur, zaghawa, and masalit ethnic groups.
Non-Argumentative	 the sudanese government, while publicly denying that it supports the janjaweed, is accused of providing financial assistance to the militia, and of participating in joint attacks targeting civilians.complicating matters is a history of conflict between the nomadic abbala, and the historically settled zaghawa and masalit, which has embittered the conflict and increased the impression that if the genocide is not the policy of khartoum it may well be that of its proxies.
Non-Argumentative	western intervention is harder than it may seem.
Non-Argumentative	 for one thing, its unclear if the sudanese government could gain control of the situation even if it wished to.
Non-Argumentative	 having armed the janaweed, any effort to crush them would likely face khartoum with a two-front war.
Non-Argumentative	 furthermore, darfur is isolated, and there are no clear ways to support an international force even with sudanese support.
Non-Argumentative	 with official opposition it might well have been impossible.
Non-Argumentative	the darfur conflict is essentially over for the moment at least.
Non-Argumentative	 a darful peace agreement was drawn up by mediators at the doha peace forum in 2011.
Non-Argumentative	 this was signed by the government of sudan and the liberation and justice movement onjuly 2011.
Non-Argumentative	 this means that this debate is really a post-mortem about whether more should have been done more.
Non-Argumentative	 there is unlikely to be any debates about what the united states should do in darfur however it may be a useful example for similar cases in the future.
Argumentative	Â the violence that occurred in the darfur region of western sudan since, approached genocide proportions with the death toll estimated between 300,000 and 500,000 out of a population of a little over a million and a half .
Argumentative	 by having called the events a genocide and then failed the west discredited itself , both as a moral force , showing it cared more about se europe than it did africa , and indicated to dictators that they have no reason to fear a western response in the future .
Argumentative	 perhaps as damaging as the humanitarian consequences of the failure to intervene is the message it sent to other leaders considering solving their political and ethnic problems in a similar manner to khartoum .
Argumentative	 rather than deterring them from following in bashir 's footsteps , the west by doing nothing , gave the impression that bashir survived not through his own efforts , but because china protected him .
Argumentative	 given the rapid expansion of chinese influence around in africa , this makes accepting chinese investment instead of western investment vastly more attractive because in addition to the economic benefits , it is now perceived as buying chinese political cover .
Argumentative	 in turn , this increasing interest in seeking out chinese political cover will lead to more states being willing to imitate bashir in the future , safe the knowledge that they will not be bombed .
Argumentative	 while sudan has been more cooperative in recent years against al-quada , it continues to harbour islamic extremist groups responsible for attacks in egypt and saudi arabia .
Argumentative	 combined with the conflict in darfur there was a pressing case for regime change , and reason to think sudan 's neighbours would be open and supportive of the idea as well .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the tendency for resistance forces to base themselves in these refugee camps , threatened and continues to threaten to spread the war into these regions , either igniting the north-south civil war in sudan , or destabilizing chad 's government .
