Non-Argumentative	professional cheerleaders can be found across a range of sports including american football, basketball, rugby league and wrestling.
Non-Argumentative	 they are particularly popular in the usa but can also be found in other countries.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, many teams in the australian national rugby league are accompanied at matches by their own cheerleading squads.
Non-Argumentative	 these squads are mainly made up of women, and are paid considerably less than the men who make up the teams that they support.
Non-Argumentative	this is not about banning cheerleading as an extra-curricular activity in schools or at college, nor is it about banning amateur cheerleading competitions (those organised for cheerleading teams who are not paid).
Non-Argumentative	 it should focus on the role of professional cheerleaders who exist specifically to support men’s sport teams, rather than to represent a school or college more generally.
Argumentative	 professional cheerleaders cause men to think of women as objects .
Argumentative	 they exist on the sidelines , wearing short skirts and looking pretty , whilst the male sports players are the heroes .
Argumentative	 this affects the way that men view women more generally .
Argumentative	 it makes them think that women are less important than men .
Argumentative	 even where professional cheerleading squads contain men , this view of women is reinforced : male cheerleaders lift women and throw them around as if they are objects and only there for decoration .
Argumentative	 professional cheerleaders affect how people view women in general , and therefore there is harm to society .
Argumentative	 although freedom of choice is often important , it is inhibited at the point that one person starts to harm others or society .
Argumentative	 as this happens in this case , cheerleading should be banned .
Argumentative	 professional cheerleaders are bad role models for women , and especially for teenagers who take part in cheerleading .
Argumentative	 they tend to wear shorter skirts and show more of their skin than college and high school cheerleaders .
Argumentative	 in addition , their routines tend to be more obviously sexual , and less focused on gymnastic stunts .
Argumentative	 when young girls at high school level are encouraged to do so , it is problematic because the sexualisation of cheer routines reinforces the idea that ` macho ' men , playing sports , a traditionally male field , are sexually rewarded or gratified for their ` macho ' performance .
Argumentative	 it reinforces the glamour of being a ` macho ' man and these men can begin to feel entitled to sexual gratification .
Argumentative	 this can lead to anger when they are turned down , which can escalate to sexual violence against women , for example , the case of the high school cheerleader who was sexually assaulted by a member of her basketball team that she cheered for .
Argumentative	 a large number of women and teenage girls suffer from eating disorders .
Argumentative	 part of the desire to be thin comes from the constant parade of ` perfect ' women .
Argumentative	 professional cheerleaders often have much of their body on show , and as men cheer them and comment on their looks , the message to women is reinforced : it is important to fit a specific version of beauty .
Argumentative	 women are very talented at sport , as demonstrated by venus and serena williams in tennis , paula radcliff in athletics or nastia liukin in gymnastics .
Argumentative	 however , when people see cheerleaders they are more likely to view women 's role in sport as one confined to looking pretty on the sidelines .
Argumentative	 women 's sport already receives a lot less coverage than men 's sport , and it is important to promote the success that women achieve .
Argumentative	 professional cheerleaders detract from this .
Argumentative	 this is further true considering that many of the women participating in professional cheerleading would no doubt be very talented at other athletic pursuits .
Argumentative	 the perception of women as on the side-lines is so ingrained that most women 's sport teams do not have a cheer squad and in several high schools in the us , cheerleaders have been uncomfortable when asked to cheer for girls sports teams .
Argumentative	 professional cheerleaders discourage lots of women , religious people and families from attending professional sports games .
Argumentative	 many people do not want to watch women dancing on the pitch wearing skimpy clothes , so do not attend .
Argumentative	 similarly , they do not bring their children because they think that it is inappropriate .
Argumentative	 professional sports games are a great way to bring people together to form a community .
Argumentative	 it also encourages children to take part in sport themselves , improving their health .
Argumentative	 professional cheerleaders are harmful because they discourage such attendance .
Argumentative	 cheerleading is a highly strenuous sport .
Argumentative	 it combines gymnastics with dance .
Argumentative	 it is also high impact , very energetic and requires sophisticated synchronized moves .
Argumentative	 not only do college teams and high school teams cheer their sports teams , but they also perform at competitions .
Argumentative	 professional squads , however , exist for the sole purpose of cheering their professional sports team .
Argumentative	 because the seeming ` professionals ' are only supporting their team and are only there to entertain , it diminishes the overall status of cheerleading as a sport .
Argumentative	 this is unfair since it is a highly demanding activity that should be considered a sport , and yet the girls and boys who participate in college and high school are not considered real athletes .
