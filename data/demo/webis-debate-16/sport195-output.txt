Non-Argumentative	the world of sport is almost entirely divided between men’s and women’s categories.
Non-Argumentative	 however men’s sport has always dominated all forms of media coverage despite the fact that women also compete in those exact same sport (increasingly on a professional level).
Non-Argumentative	 this includes live broadcasting, newspaper and internet articles and reports, news coverage etc. for example, in the usa women’s sports receive a total of 1.6% of sports airtime on local tv and sports media giant espn.
Non-Argumentative	 [1] a similar story is noticed in australian sports media where women’s sports coverage totalled 9% compared to 81% on men’s sports.
Non-Argumentative	 [2] in the written press the numbers are similarly skewed.
Non-Argumentative	 betweenand 2009,articles were published on women’s football in the british press.
Non-Argumentative	 putting this into context, in the same time spanarticles were published on coventry city fc (a lower league british club) alone.
Non-Argumentative	 [3] what’s important to note with the examples given is that they are all taken from countries that have a relatively large participation and interest in women’s sports.
Non-Argumentative	 paradoxically, although the level of participation of girls and women in sport has increased significantly over the past decades this does not appear to have transposed onto increased airtime for women’s sports.
Non-Argumentative	 indeed some studies have shown the opposite has occurred and the gap in coverage between men’s and women’s sport has widened.
Argumentative	 [4] the only notable exceptions to the male domination in the world of sport are in the olympic games where coverage is equal irrespective of gender, and to a lesser extent grand slam tennis where coverage is roughly equal but the men’s competitions still carry more prestige.
Argumentative	sport is dominated by a male-orientated world view .
Argumentative	 this is the case in two respects : this male dominated world-view is unfair on female athletes .
Argumentative	 sport is supposed to be a celebration of the human mind and body , and it is right that athletes that push themselves to the brink in search for glory receive due praise .
Argumentative	 the hugely skewed coverage of sport against women 's sports caused by the male world-view in the media is hugely unfair on female athletes , as they do not get the deserved recognition their male counterparts receive .
Argumentative	 the male world-view which dominates sports media and conveys to the public that women 's sport are inferior to men 's reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and deter young girls from becoming active in sport .
Argumentative	 gender perceptions have obviously come a long way in the lastyears , but the media classification of women 's sport as inferior to men 's is severely slowing this progress in the field of sport .
Argumentative	 humans are social beings with esteem needs , and as social beings we like to be viewed in a positive light by our peers .
Argumentative	 this is best achieved on a general level by conforming to social expectations and norm .
Argumentative	 this also applies for societal conceptions of gender .
Argumentative	 the fact that the media deems women 's sport to be of lesser importance which , as we have seen , conveys to the public this message , reinforces the notion that sport is not a worthwhile activity for women and girls .
Argumentative	 instead , it is an activity more appropriate for men and boys .
Argumentative	 this kind of discourse has the effect of moulding gender identities both in terms of how men perceive women and how women perceive themselves .
Argumentative	 in this way , the lack of media coverage of women 's sport fuels a self-affirming perception of gender which effectively denies many young girls a realistic choice of becoming engaged in sport as perceptions affect confidence in one 's ability ; as a result of this gender bias boys as young as six rate themselves as being much more competent in sports than girls do .
Argumentative	  by forcing the media to provide equal coverage of both men 's and women 's sport , we take an effective step in breaking these societal discourses and transforming gender perceptions .
Argumentative	 this is because increased coverage will make sport seem like a worthwhile activity for girls and women .
Argumentative	 as more women take part in sport , this has a further cyclical effect of re-affirming gender conceptions around sport which , in turn , induces further women to become engaged in sport .
Argumentative	 this is a desirable outcome from the government 's perspective because sport has a positive impact on the health of those who are physically active .
Argumentative	 those who are physically active are not only less likely to suffer from things like coronary heart disease and cancer , but they have also been shown to lead more psychologically happy lives due to the endorphins released while exercising , and the joy of feeling physically fit .
Argumentative	 a more obvious problem with the limited coverage of women 's sport is the distinct lack of sports role models available as sources of inspiration for girls .
Argumentative	 having sports role models is crucial for children to attain the desire and motivation to partake in sport .
Argumentative	 boys often want to be like lionel messi in football , or lebron james in basketball .
Argumentative	 boys can access such figureheads because they are world famous .
Argumentative	 their sporting achievements and prowess are glorified in all forms of media and people can very easily watch them play their sport live on tv .
Argumentative	 the same does not exist for girls because female athletes receive nowhere near as much media attention as their male counterparts .
Argumentative	 girls often ca n't even name any female sports stars so lack role models in sport .
Argumentative	  although it is true that children can have role models of either sex , the divide in the sports world between men 's and women 's sports means girls can not aspire to compete alongside the likes of usain bolt or michael phelps .
Argumentative	 the successes of british female athletes like rebecca adlington , jessica ennis and victoria pendleton , or the young katie ledecky from the usa in the recent olympics have captured the hearts and imagination of a huge number of young girls across the uk and already , as local sports centres and athletics clubs have seen participation amongst girls soar during and after the london olympics .
Argumentative	 this is no coincidence -- it is because of the media attention and glorification female athletes receive .
Argumentative	 the olympic games are an example of what equal media coverage of men 's and women 's sport can achieve , the equal coverage of grand slam tennis and the subsequent glorification of the likes of maria sharapova and serena williams is another example .
Argumentative	 we must take action to provide the same sort of role models across all sporting events .
Argumentative	 increased media coverage will lead to more money going into women 's sport .
Argumentative	 this will happen for several reasons .
Argumentative	 increased government funding is desirable because it leads to better facilities and coaching , increased public awareness , increased participation and , ultimately , in improved results on the sporting field , as was seen in both beijing and london for team gb .
