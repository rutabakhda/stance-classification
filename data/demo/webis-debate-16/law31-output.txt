Non-Argumentative	the use of children (for the purposes of this article, anyone younger than eighteen years-of-age) in warfare has been a continuous feature of all human conflicts, but declined rapidly in europe in the first half of the twentieth century.
Non-Argumentative	 the intensive development of the laws and customs of war that took place between the first world war and the collapse of the ussr placed an increasing emphasis on the role of supranational bodies and treaties in regulating the conduct of states in armed disputes and protecting the rights of civilians caught up in war zones.
Non-Argumentative	in 1998, following the creation of ad hoc tribunals designed to investigate and punish the perpetrators of war crimes in the former yugoslavia and rwanda, the rome statute created the international criminal court.
Non-Argumentative	 sincethe icc has had jurisdiction over events occurring in the territory of parties to the statute, or over situations referred to it by the united nations security council.
Non-Argumentative	 the icc was intended to be complementary to the domestic law of states party to the treaty, investigating war crimes in circumstances where a state’s judiciary is unable to do so itself.
Non-Argumentative	 the use of children in combat roles in armed conflict is prohibited by article 8.2.26 of the rome statute - "conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into the national armed forces or using them to participate actively in hostilities" is defined as a war crime.
Non-Argumentative	although many post-colonial states may be signatories to the rome statute, they often govern highly plural societies that contain diverse forms of cultural and social grouping.
Non-Argumentative	 indeed, the representativeness of such governments, and the extent to which “fourth world” communities within the borders of established nations are consulted about participation in international institutions, is often a contentious issue within post-colonial states.
Non-Argumentative	 in many of these communities, military participation by boys as young as twelve is considered a necessary measure for the protection of isolated settlements and an important marker of a boy’s passage into manhood.
Argumentative	 the issues underlying all debates on child soldiers go to the very heart of intercultural justice , politics and governance .
Argumentative	 international and supranational legislation notwithstanding , the notion that children should be protected from all forms of violence at any cost is expressly western .
Argumentative	 western notions of inviolate childhood , free of worry and violence , are merely a cultural construct .
Argumentative	 this construct can not be duplicated in societies beset by forms of privation and conflict that have been alien to western liberal democracies for the last seventy years .
Argumentative	 attempting to enforce this construct as law - and as a form of law that can trump domestic legislation - endangers vulnerable communities , inhibits the creation of democratic norms and can even criminalise the children it claims to protect .
Argumentative	 laws are , ultimately , social norms that are taught , enforced and arbitrated on by the state .
Argumentative	 the value of these norms is such that they are deemed to be a vital part of a society 's identity and the state is entrusted with their protection .
Argumentative	 however , this ideal can be difficult to achieve .
Argumentative	 debate as to which norms the state should be custodian of is constant .
Argumentative	 where there is a disconnect between a law and the daily lives , aspirations and struggles of a society , it becomes unlikely that that law will be complied with .
Argumentative	 generally , a state will not be able to give a pronouncement the force of law if it does not reflect the values held by a majority of a society .
Argumentative	 what if the state that is intended to mount the `` piecemeal intervention '' of banning the use of child soldiers is weak , corrupt or non-existent ?
Argumentative	 what if a state can not carry out structured interventions of the type described above ?
Argumentative	 norms that state that the conscription of children is acceptable - due to tradition or need - will be dominant .
Argumentative	 in order for the juristic principles underlying the authority of the icc to function properly , it is necessary for there to be a degree of certainty and accessibility underlying laws promulgated by a state .
Argumentative	 while ignorance of the law is not a defence before the icc , it impossible to call a system of law fair or just that is not overseen by a stable or accepted government .
Argumentative	 this is not possible if a state is so corrupt that it does not command the trust of its people ; if a state is so poor that it can not afford to operate an open , reliable and transparent court and advocacy system ; if territory with a state 's borders is occupied by an armed aggressor .
Argumentative	 western notions of rule-of-law are almost impossible to enforce under such conditions .
Argumentative	 all of these are scenarios encountered frequently in africa , and central and southern asia .
Argumentative	 some regions within developing nations are so isolated from the influence of the state , or so heavily contested in internecine conflicts , that communities living within them can not be expected to know that the state nominally responsible for them has signed the convention of the rights of the child or the rome statute .
Argumentative	 nor can the state attempt to inform them of this fact .
Argumentative	 laws still exist and are enforced within such communities , but these are not state-made forms of law .
Argumentative	 child soldiers and their commanders are simply obeying the strongest , the most effective and the most stable source of law in their immediate environment .
Argumentative	 what is harmful to this process of recovery is the branding of child soldiers as war criminals .
Argumentative	 the stigma attached to such a conviction would condemn hundreds of former child soldiers to suffering extended beyond the end of armed conflicts .
Argumentative	 sentencing guidelines binding on the icc state that anyone convicted of war crimes who is younger than eighteen should not be subject to a sentence of life imprisonment .
Argumentative	 their treatment , once incarcerated , is required to be oriented toward rehabilitation .
Argumentative	 the jurisdiction of the icc is primarily exercised according to culturally constructed assumptions about the way war works -- that there will be a clear division between aggressors and defenders , that armies will be organised according to chains of command , the civilians will not be targeted and will be evacuated from conflict zones .
Argumentative	 but countless conflicts in africa and central asia have proven these assumptions to be flawed .
Argumentative	 it should not be forgotten that almost all formulations of this motion define cultural relativism only as a defence to the use of child soldiers .
Argumentative	 it will still be open for icc prosecutors to prove that the use of child soldiers has been systematic , pernicious and deliberate , rather than the product of uncertainty , necessity and unstable legal norms .
Argumentative	 moreover , not all defences are `` complete '' defences ; they do not all result in acquittal , and are often used by judges to mitigate the harshness of certain sentences .
Argumentative	 it can be argued that it was never intended for the icc to enforce laws relating to child soldiers against other children or leaders of vulnerable communities who acted under the duress of circumstances .
Argumentative	 at the very least , those responsible for arming children in these circumstances should face a more lenient sentence than a better-resourced state body that used child soldiers as a matter of policy .
Argumentative	 due to the nature of conflicts in developing nations , where the geographic influence of `` recognised '' governments is limited , and multiple local law-making bodies may contribute to an armed struggle , it is difficult for the international community to directly oversee combat itself .
Argumentative	 united nations troops are often underfunded , unmotivated and poorly trained , being sourced primarily from the same continent as the belligerent parties in a conflict .
Argumentative	 when peacekeepers are deployed from western nations , their rules of engagement have previously prevented robust protection of civilian populations .
Argumentative	 ironically , this is partly the result of concerns that western states might be accused of indulging in neo-colonialism .
Argumentative	 it is outrageous for the international community to dictate standards of war-time conduct to communities and states unable to enforce them , while withholding the assistance and expertise that might allow them to do so .
Argumentative	 therefore , the icc , as a specialist legal and investigative body , should be encouraged to use the expertise it has accumulated to distinguish between child military participation driven by a desire to terrorise populations or quickly reinforce armies , and child military participation that has arisen as a survival strategy .
