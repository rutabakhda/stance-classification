Non-Argumentative	modern systems of government seek, through constitutions and legislation to divide the powers of the state between separate branches of government, so that power never rests in the hands of any one individual.
Non-Argumentative	 this is done with varying degrees of success in governments around the world; developed european and north american countries have constructed quite robust systems for the separation of powers, while in much of the developing world, particularly in africa, asia, and parts of south america power has settled in the hands of powerful individuals, both elected and dictatorial.
Non-Argumentative	 one of the major tools used to try to check executive power is the institution of term limits.
Non-Argumentative	 term limits seek to limit the extent to which single individuals can dominate the governments of countries, and have succeeded in being upheld to varying extents around the world.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states for example has a limit of two terms for the presidency which was changed from being an informal limit created by george washington when he refused a third term to being formal by the twenty second amendment infollowing franklin delano roosevelt’s four term presidency from 1933-45.
Non-Argumentative	 the united kingdom on the other hand has no term limits on its prime minister.
Non-Argumentative	 this should not be about individual office holders and whether they should have had a third term – or in roosevelt’s case not had one.
Non-Argumentative	 instead this debate should be about the principle of term limits for the highest executive office.
Non-Argumentative	possible mechanism:the executive is only one of the branches of government.
Non-Argumentative	 the legislature and the judiciary often have equally important roles to play and in the context of term limits it is up to them to set the limit.
Non-Argumentative	 the term limit will require a super majority of the legislature to pass as if it is to be effective it should become part of the constitution so that it cannot be easily changed by the executive and his supporters in the legislature.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states did this inwhen the twenty-second amendment of the united states constitution was passed by two thirds majority in both houses of congress and ratified by three quarters of the states.
Argumentative	 term limits are a necessary check on executive power to prevent an over mighty executive .
Argumentative	 whereas the legislature and judiciary are composed of many competing views , with members of various parties and outlooks represented , the executive of a country speaks with a single voice .
Argumentative	 in legislatures , party leaders are not the sole sources of power , with factions and alternative nexuses of influence forming throughout that branch of government .
Argumentative	 executive power , on the other hand , rests solely in the hands of the leader , usually a president .
Argumentative	 the leader has full power over the policies of the executive branch of government .
Argumentative	 cabinets , which form part of the executive in practice , are usually directly answerable to the leader , and ministers can be dismissed if they are uncooperative or dispute the leader 's policies .
Argumentative	 even in parliamentary systems , leaders with a majority and a strong party whip can command the same powers as a strong president , if not more .
Argumentative	 it is thus necessary to have a check on the highly individual power that is the executive .
Argumentative	 term limits are the best such check .
Argumentative	 term limits allow leaders to enact their policies over a set time period and then usher them out of office .
Argumentative	 this is essential , because too much power in the hands of a single individual for too long can upset the balance of power in a country and shift power in favour of the executive , thus damaging the protections to society that checks provide .
Argumentative	 this is exactly what happened in the united kingdom under tony blair where from the start cabinet government virtually disappeared former cabinet secretary lord butler said `` in the eight months i was cabinet secretary when tony blair was prime minister , the only decision the cabinet took was about the millennium dome , '' and power continued to be ever more centralized in response to terrorism .
Argumentative	 power has a strong tendency to corrupt ; it is highly intoxicating .
Argumentative	 for this reason , it should not be left in the hands of one person for too long .
Argumentative	 when a leader is firmly entrenched , he may seek to enrich himself at the expense of the public .
Argumentative	 he may seek to shower benefices on family and allies in order to maintain and strengthen his powerful position .
Argumentative	 without term limits the executive runs the risk of becoming a personal fief , rather than the office of first servant of the people , as it should be .
Argumentative	 this is seen particularly in parts of the developing world where leaders use state funds to generate electoral support from key groups and to maintain the loyalty of essential supporters .
Argumentative	 a current example of this is in venezuela where hugo chavez has been able to monopolize power to the point where it is unclear who his successor would be should he die suddenly .
Argumentative	 term limits serve to limit the ability of individuals to enact self-aggrandizing policies and to retain power indefinitely .
Argumentative	 instead , by maintaining term limits , leaders have only a limited time in power , which tends to shift their focus toward genuinely benefiting the public .
Argumentative	 incumbency provides a huge election advantage .
Argumentative	 leaders and politicians generally , almost always win re-election .
Argumentative	 such has been the case in the united states , for example , where presidents are almost always re-elected for a second term .
Argumentative	 leaders are re-elected because they have better name recognition both with the electorate and with lobby groups .
Argumentative	 people have a tendency to vote for those who they recognize , and firms tend to support past winners who will likely continue to benefit their interests .
Argumentative	 this problem has become particularly serious in developing world in which revolutionary leaders from the original independence movements are still politically active .
Argumentative	 these leaders often command huge followings and mass loyalty , which they use to maintain power in spite of poor decisions and corruption in many cases .
Argumentative	 such has been the case in zimbabwe with robert mugabe winning presidential elections in spite of mass corruption and mismanagement .
Argumentative	 only recently have the people finally voted against him , but it was too late , as his power had become too entrenched to unseat him .
Argumentative	 the uphill battle that will always exist to unseat incumbents makes term limits necessary .
Argumentative	 countries need new ideas and new leaders to enact them .
Argumentative	 old leaders using election machines to retain power do their country a disservice .
Argumentative	 power is best used when it changes hands over time in order allow for dynamic new solutions to be mooted in a changing world .
Argumentative	 a focus of a leader who is looking toward the next election is on getting votes .
Argumentative	 it is often the case that hard decisions need to be made by leaders , but it is difficult for them to do so when they are concerned with being re-elected .
Argumentative	 a leader has an incentive to put tough decisions off if he can retain power by doing so .
Argumentative	 when constrained by term limits , leaders must make the most of their limited time in office , resulting in greater prioritization of difficult decisions and reform .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the need to constantly fight elections places leaders in the pocket of lobby-groups and election supporters to a greater degree , as they will always need to go back to them for support , and thus can not make decisions that are in the national interest alone .
Argumentative	 while there will always be some of this behaviour , it is curtailed by term limits , as leaders in their final term will not be beholden to as many special interests as they can not run again .
Argumentative	 furthermore , leaders who develop strong party structures can influence the choice of their successor , ensuring that they have a legacy .
Argumentative	 in this way term limits encourage the development of party-based systems , rather than personality based systems of government .
