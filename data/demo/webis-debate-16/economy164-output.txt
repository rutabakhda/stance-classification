Non-Argumentative	one of the biggest and most influential industries in the world is the oil business; oil companies areof the world’sbiggest public companies andof the topby sales, and these are not even the world’s biggest oil companies; state owned ones are bigger.
Non-Argumentative	 these companies are therefore clearly influential, they have a lot of money to spend and they can potentially transform the fortunes of a country if they decide to invest.
Non-Argumentative	to make matters worse oil companies go where the oil is, which will often mean working in the poorest countries; those least able to exercise control over the industry.
Non-Argumentative	 these are also countries for whom the striking of oil wealth can have a transformative effect.
Non-Argumentative	 a small impoverished country can become (technically) wealthy overnight if there is a large strike of oil on their territory.
Non-Argumentative	 there is immediately a problem of what to do with this wealth.
Non-Argumentative	 the wealth is in the ground, a foreign company will need to dig it up and sell the oil passing money on to the country.
Non-Argumentative	 yet the country has no expertise to manage a bidding process and little leverage over the companies once they begin drilling beyond killing the golden goose.
Non-Argumentative	oil wealth does not automatically solve a country’s problems.
Non-Argumentative	 indeed there are many poor countries with large oil reserves an example of this is equatorial guinea which is considered a high income economy by the world bank yet also has 76.8% of the population in poverty.
Non-Argumentative	 this is because all the oil wealth goes into the hands of the country’s dictator teodoro obiang nguema and his cronies.
Non-Argumentative	 the question is how can such a situation be avoided?
Non-Argumentative	 one suggestion has been that the money that comes from oil wealth – which may come directly from a state owned oil company or taxes on the production from private companies as a result of the oil being a state resource (the usa is the only country where the resources underground is entirely private) – should be put in an independent fund.
Non-Argumentative	 this is what norway does.
Non-Argumentative	 this fund would be out of reach of politicians and only give back a certain amount per year – such as just the profit from the investments.
Argumentative	 the wealth from oil , or other natural resources , holds back democratization as a result of the `` resources curse '' or `` paradox of plenty '' .
Argumentative	 resources provide money , and money is what is needed to run a security state .
Argumentative	 when money can come from natural resources there is little need to tax the people , instead it becomes a `` rentier '' economy where the dictator has resources to buy support without recourse to taxation .
Argumentative	 it is essentially the opposite of the well-known idea ` no taxation without representation ' ; if the money comes not from taxes but from oil what need is there for democracy ?
Argumentative	 this proposal takes away the option of having access to large oil revenues instead providing only a limited amount to the state rather than the pockets of the dictator .
Argumentative	 this prevents the buying of key groups such as the army and the policy who can be used to repress the population .
Argumentative	 it is not by chance that the only countries in the arab middle east that could be considered democracies before the arab spring never had oil ; jordan and lebanon .
Argumentative	 environmental damage is an example of the ` tragedy of the commons ' where if a resource is not owned by an individual , or is free to all , then it will be overexploited .
Argumentative	 this is because it is in everyone 's self-interest to use it as much as possible .
Argumentative	 the result is pollution ; politicians and oil companies want to exploit the oil as cheaply as possible so they dump pollution on the local population .
Argumentative	 for example , the $billion ruling handed down last year by a court in lago agrio , a town near ecuador 's border with colombia , held chevron accountable for health and environmental damages resulting from chemical-laden wastewater dumped fromto .
Argumentative	 putting oil wealth into a trust fund can help prevent this kind of abuse .
Argumentative	 there are two reasons for this .
Argumentative	 first if politicians are not getting an immediate benefit they will be less inclined to overlook pollution and there wo n't be money to buy support for drilling and pollution to continue .
Argumentative	 the second is that since the fund is meant to provide long term benefits and investments one of the things it can be doing is being devoted to cleaning up any pollution that is created thus protecting the future generations .
Argumentative	 it is very tempting to recklessly use an unexpected windfall of money immediately .
Argumentative	 but the best thing to do is to invest for the long term either to build infrastructure that will pay back its cost in future economic growth , or to invest it in funds that will continue paying dividends long into the future .
Argumentative	 the example of how britain and norway spent their north sea oil revenues is very revealing : `` the british governments spent their north sea winnings on cutting national borrowing and keeping down taxes .
Argumentative	 whatever came in went straight into the day-to-day budget .
Argumentative	 by contrast , for the pastyears norway has squirreled away the government 's petroleum revenue in a national oil fund ''  which now has $billion in assets , almost twice the country 's gdp , providing% returns .
Argumentative	  the advantage of such investment is that they will continue to bring income even after the oil is gone .
Argumentative	 the oil will therefore benefit future generations as well as the current one .
Argumentative	 a panel of experts which are immune to political influence is the most likely body to think about long-term needs of the country and devise a plan which can ultimately bring income for a long period of time .
Argumentative	 having oil does not just provide the money to undermine , or prevent democracy taking hold ; it also provides an immense source for corruption .
Argumentative	 oil revenues provide a revenue stream that is not dependent on the people but simply upon the global market and oil production .
Argumentative	 in a country with no checks and balances , accountability or transparency the money will inevitably go to the elite .
Argumentative	 this is how equatorial guinea can be rich while having most of the population in poverty .
Argumentative	 dictator obiang himself is worth an estimated $ 700million or the equivalent of about% of gdp .
Argumentative	  a trust fund can ensure that money from oil goes to the poorest not the richest .
Argumentative	 it is managed outside the country and away from political pressure .
Argumentative	 if the government is corrupt and uses the national budget to its own ends the trust fund can provide the dividends as investment in individual development projects to ensure the money is used where it is most needed .
Argumentative	 all the time it can be transparent to show when and where the government is trying to influence it or get backhanders .
