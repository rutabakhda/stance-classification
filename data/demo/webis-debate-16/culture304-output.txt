Non-Argumentative	locally produced food is food that has been farmed near to the point of sale.
Non-Argumentative	 however how local still counts as local?
Non-Argumentative	  whole foods in the usa considers local producers to be withinmiles of the store or as much ashours travel away while many people would consider that it should be much more local, even within the usa 50% believe local should mean within 100miles.
Non-Argumentative	over the past decade the politics of food has assumed increasing importance in western countries.
Non-Argumentative	 organic farming has become a mainstream movement worth billions of dollars a year and fair-trade goods are now sold in most supermarkets.
Non-Argumentative	 the slow food movement, which celebrates the authenticity of regional cuisine, seasonal changes in the availability of foodstuffs, and the labor of small-scale producers, has spread from its origins in italy to become influential in the usa, britain and beyond.
Non-Argumentative	part of this upsurge of interest in where food comes from has been a recent emphasis on shopping locally, buying foods from crops grown and livestock raised by nearby farmers.
Non-Argumentative	 in the uk, usa and elsewhere, farmers markets where local producers sell directly to consumers have taken off, providing producers with an alternative to selling the fruits of their labors to hard-bargaining supermarkets.
Non-Argumentative	 locally-produced foods are also sold directly from farm shops, and through delivery schemes such as weekly vegetable boxes.
Non-Argumentative	increasingly, major food purchasers such as councils and schools are making commitments to buy locally-grown produce for use in the meals they provide.
Non-Argumentative	 and major supermarket chains such as the uk’s tesco are increasingly stocking ranges of locally-produced foods, selling them at a profitable price premium.
Non-Argumentative	supporters of shopping for locally produced food argue that it has a great many advantages, from economic support for the area’s farmers and greater community cohesion, to environmental and health benefits.
Non-Argumentative	 but while nobody takes the extremist position that you should never buy locally-produced foods, critics have begun to question whether many of the benefits claimed for shopping local actually exist, and to point out that there may be actual disadvantages of too much emphasis on local purchasing.
Non-Argumentative	this however is not all about individual consumers deciding to buy in farmers markets.
Non-Argumentative	 it is much easier and more effective if it was the shops themselves, including supermarkets, which have to source as much food as possible locally.
Non-Argumentative	 any regulation to force local sourcing of products would be difficult as local produce is not available at all times and different localities will produce different products.
Non-Argumentative	 however there could be inducements such as tax breaks for the amount of locally sourced food.
Non-Argumentative	 simply locally sourcing the food is not enough, stores should have to ensure that the produce does not have to travel unnecessarily long distances.
Argumentative	  shopping for local produce is also part of a wider movement to rediscover and celebrate local food cultures .
Argumentative	 the slow food movement emphasises the cultural importance of local cuisines based upon the range of foods that are available within a particular region .
Argumentative	 by treating the whole world as our larder we have gained an enormous choice of foods , but at the cost of our own culinary heritage and folk traditions .
Argumentative	 this can cause problems as for example with local varieties of rice in africa being lost due to competition from cheaper rice producers like thailand .
Argumentative	 each individual cuisine deserves to be preserved and encouraged .
Argumentative	 we have also lost a sense of seasonality , expecting asparagus and strawberries all year round .
Argumentative	 local food restores this connection with the rhythm of the seasons , and connects us to the land around us and to our ancestors who helped to shape it .
Argumentative	 by creating a market for a wide variety of agricultural produce , shopping locally will encourage local farmers to grow and rear a wide variety of crops and animals .
Argumentative	 intensive modern farming often consists of huge agribusinesses growing monocultures of wheat , corn , rape or soya over vast areas , with little room left for nature .
Argumentative	 in britain this has led to a decline in farmland birds with numbers at ayear low , even livestock farming can impose one type of farming practice upon the environment and drive out plants and animals which can not cope with those methods .
Argumentative	 more varied farming practices are valuable for promoting biodiversity , encouraging a whole range of birds , animals and plants to establish themselves in field margins and adjacent wild areas .
Argumentative	 local variety is also good farming practice , as it means that any disease or pest infestation will not be able to spread quickly to devastate a whole region .
Argumentative	 shopping locally supports local farmers and the local economy -- and if it is the retailer who is buying locally then whether the retailer itself is not local will not matter .
Argumentative	 typically farmers are forced to sell to middlemen or big business , such as huge supermarket corporations .
Argumentative	 this means growers see only a small fraction of the price the public eventually pays in the store , as little ascents of every dollar in the usa .
Argumentative	 this drives down farm incomes and is forcing many farmers off the land as they can no longer make a living .
Argumentative	 by selling directly to the public at farmers ' markets and farm shops instead , producers can ensure that they get a fair price for their crops and livestock .
Argumentative	 the income this provides is particularly crucial for small producers , and for farmers committed to more sustainable , less intensive methods , such as organic production .
Argumentative	 it does not only help the farmers , but also the rest of the economy .
Argumentative	 while many experts confess that it is hard to measure the direct effects of buying local products , dan houston from an economic development consultancy projected inwith the example of austin book stores that buying local saves jobs .
Argumentative	 he explained that on every dollar to the austin economy ,cents returns , while with buying at the national store borders , the return to the community is onlycents .
Argumentative	 also the researcher emphasized that in the michigan community grand rapids , a% shift of spending towards local businesses incould createjobs with a payroll ofmillion dollars .
Argumentative	 consumers who want to support their local producers and sustainable farming over big agribusiness and retailers should therefore aim to shop locally wherever possible .
Argumentative	 buying locally-produced food means that it will be much fresher and healthier .
Argumentative	 typical supermarket fruit and vegetables are often picked 4-7 days before they make it on to the shelves , and so may be nearly two weeks old before they are actually eaten , by which time much of their goodness will have long departed .
Argumentative	 to cope with these long delays , many fruits are picked in an unripe state , so that they do not start to rot on the supermarket shelves -- meaning their full flavour has never developed out in the sun on the tree or plant .
Argumentative	 by buying locally consumers can ensure that they get the tastiest , healthiest food as it is often picked the afternoon before going to market or if going to stores can get there in much less time .
Argumentative	 local produce will also encourage people to vary their diet by trying new foods if they come from local producers , who can offer tastings and recipe advice .
