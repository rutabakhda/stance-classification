Argumentative	Â many middle eastern states already have institutions that are similar to the representative institutions that a stable democracy needs so can easily become the real thing .
Argumentative	 arab dictators have grown adept at holding elections , setting up parliaments ; constitutional courts etc. as window dressing to show either to their people or to the outside world that they are reforming and are ` democratic ' .
Argumentative	 no matter how undemocratic these regimes have been the simple existence of these institutions is useful when there is a revolution as they allow some continuity and the possibility of a transition to democracy .
Argumentative	 to take egypt where protests toppled the mubarak regime as an example .
Argumentative	 it has a parliament with the majilis al-sha ' ab , people 's assembly , as its lower house and majilis al-shura , shura council , as its upper house .
Argumentative	 in both houses a majority of the members are directly elected .
Argumentative	 egypt held elections for its parliament as recently as november, these elections had very poor turnout and blatant ballot rigging while the main opposition the muslim brotherhood have to stand as independents .
Argumentative	 egypt also has previously had local elections for 52,000 municipal council seats in some 4,500 towns and cities .
Argumentative	 these elections are just as fraudulent as those for the national parliament .
Argumentative	 according to muslim brotherhood mp jamdi hassan `` the ruling party used to allow opposition candidates to run and then simply rig the elections .
Argumentative	 now , it has adopted a new strategy to ensure its continued domination : preventing the opposition from fielding any candidates at all . ''
Argumentative	 this may not be the best democratic tradition but at least it is a start .
Argumentative	 similarly egypt has a supreme constitutional court that is supposed to be independent .
Argumentative	 while these institutions may have ceased working in a democratic way they could quite easily be changed in to being fully democratic .
Argumentative	 this would create the necessary checks and balances to sustain democracy over the long term .
Argumentative	 the people are used to elections and will know what to do when they have the option to vote freely , they would vote in a broad range of candidates .
Argumentative	 many of them may be islamist but it would be democratic .

Argumentative	 it limits the number of presidential terms to two , promises to strengthen the judiciary and abolish some of the emergency laws .
Argumentative	 a turnout of% is not as good as it could have been but it was a great advance compared to other polls in recent egyptian history .
Argumentative	 mohamed ahmed attia , the chairman of the supreme judicial committee that supervised the elections , explained its significance as being `` the first real referendum in egypt 's history , we had an unprecedented turnout because after jan.people started to feel that their vote would matter . ''
Argumentative	 because egypt has historically been at the center of the arab world success in egypt will be vital to show that a stable arab democracy can be created .
Argumentative	 the economic , social , and political history of the region show there are many obstacles to establishing stable democracies in the middle east .
Argumentative	 many in the west fear that islam is among these barriers , with claims that islamist parties like the muslim brotherhood in egypt and ennahda in tunisia will turn their countries into theocracies like iran .
Argumentative	 however , there are majority-muslim states with islamist parties that have succeeded in creating stable democracies , including turkey and indonesia .
Argumentative	 both countries are good case studies that disprove the widespread notion that islam is incompatible with democracy .
Argumentative	 turkey is most often cited as a good example for the arab spring to follow .
Argumentative	 the election of the akp has shown that an islamic party can also uphold democracy , so providing a good example for the powerful muslim brotherhood in the arab world .
Argumentative	 elections are free and fair and the press is relatively free .
Argumentative	 the prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has faced down coup threats from the military , again something that may well be necessary given the large role the military has had in the previous regimes .
Argumentative	 turkey 's economy is growing briskly and turkey is following a foreign policy of reaching out to everybody and is touting itself as a model for arab countries to follow .
Argumentative	 in indonesia inthere was a revolution that ousted president suharto who had like mubarak been in power for thirty years .
Argumentative	 this revolution progressed in a very similar way to the ongoing revolution in egypt -- in both countries the protesters were middle class and young , the president went relatively peacefully and the military helped during the transition .
Argumentative	 indonesia is now the largest muslim democracy in the world and while there are islamist parties in parliament their support is now below% .
Argumentative	 indonesia can therefore provide a road map for moving from an interim government with the military in control to a fully functioning and successful democracy .
