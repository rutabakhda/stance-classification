Argumentative	Â it is unconstitutional to require individuals to buy private insurance , and penalize them for not doing so , that is , penalizing their non-act , their omission to purchase insurance .
Argumentative	 as david b. rivkin jr. and lee a. casey argue : `` ... can congress require every american to buy health insurance ?
Argumentative	 in short , no .
Argumentative	 the constitution assigns only limited , enumerated powers to congress and none , including the power to regulate interstate commerce or to impose taxes , would support a federal mandate requiring anyone who is otherwise without health insurance to buy it . ''
Argumentative	  the congressional budget office believes `` a mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action .
Argumentative	 the government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the united states . ''
Argumentative	  an individual mandate would have two features that , in combination , would make it unique .
Argumentative	 first , it imposes a duty on individuals due to them being members of society .
Argumentative	 second , it requires the purchase of a specific service on pain of tax penalties if that product is not purchased .
Argumentative	  as noted by sen. john ensign , a nevada republican : `` anything we have ever done , somebody actually had to have an action before we could tax or regulate it . ''
Argumentative	  as robert a. levy and michael f. cannon of the cato institute argue : `` congress ' attempt to punish a non-act that harms no one is an intolerable affront to the constitution , liberty , and personal autonomy .
Argumentative	 that shameful fact can not be altered by calling it health-care reform . ''
Argumentative	  the individual healthcare insurance mandate would , for the first time , mean the government setting uo a monopoly or a cartel with which every citizen of the us would be compelled - by a statutory power - to do business .
Argumentative	 this destroys any pretence of individual market freedom , individuals would be required to contribute money out of each and every pay check they earned to either a government entity which would be staffed and/or controlled by political appointees or to a cartel made up of companies that would owe their continued existence on the cartel list to the acquiescence of political overseers .
Argumentative	 either way , the reduction in individual autonomy and freedom over health care choices would be dramatically decreased and inevitably politicized .
Argumentative	 this has obvious worrying possibilities for corruption , the party in power would favour those who donate to the party .
Argumentative	  enforcing the mandate may also intrude on constitutional rights .
Argumentative	 sherry glied , ph.d. , assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the u.s. department of health and human services has warned , `` , d , eveloping a system to promptly identify and penalize scofflaws , people who flout the law , will take effort and ingenuity , particularly in our diverse and mobile country .
Argumentative	 it may require a degree of intrusiveness and bureaucracy that some will find unpalatable . ''
Argumentative	  this is likely to mean much more intrusive inspection , for example hospitals having to report to the government patients they have who do n't have health insursnce ,  this is why a majority of the states , and numerous organizations and individual persons , have filed actions in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate , and several courts have already struck it down on constitutional grounds .
Argumentative	  for all these reasons it is clear that for congress to try to penalize a non-act is an unprecedented and unconstitutional power grab , and so the individual mandate is unconstitutional .
Argumentative	 it has been argued that the individual healthcare mandate is authorised by the constitution 's empowerment of congress to `` regulate interstate commerce '' , known as the `` commerce clause '' , however this is not true and the commerce clause does not authorize health insurance mandates .
Argumentative	 as the congressional research service has written : `` despite the breadth of powers that have been exercised under the commerce clause , it is unclear whether the clause would provide a solid constitutional foundation for legislation containing a requirement to have health insurance .
Argumentative	 whether such a requirement would be constitutional under the commerce clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal , as it is a novel issue whether congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a service . ''
Argumentative	  the most obvious reason for this is that an omission to buy health insurance can in no way be termed ` interstate commerce ' , as there is no activity or commerce going on .
Argumentative	 this is not in keeping with the commerce clause , unlike other previous federal healthcare laws .
Argumentative	 there is no doubt that congress can regulate an entire array of economic activities , large and small , inter - and intra-state .
Argumentative	 thus , for example , there is no problem , constitution-wise with having congress regulate health care insurance purchase transactions .
Argumentative	 the problem with an individual insurance purchase mandate , however , is that it does not regulate any transactions at all ; it regulates human beings , simply because they exist , and orders them to engage in certain types of economic transactions .
Argumentative	  while most health care insurers and health care providers may engage in interstate commerce and may be regulated accordingly under the commerce clause , it is a different matter to find a basis for imposing commerce clause related regulation on an individual citizen who chooses not to undertake a commercial transaction .
Argumentative	 the decision not to engage in affirmative conduct is arguably distinguishable from cases in which commerce clause regulatory authority was recognized over intra-state activity : growing wheat , for example , wickard v. filmore , or , more recently , growing marijuana , gonzales v. raich .
Argumentative	  in the case of a mandate to purchase health insurance or face a tax or penalty , congress would have to explain how not doing something -- not buying insurance and not seeking health care services -- implicated interstate commerce .
Argumentative	  therefore , it is clear that congress is not empowered to regulate the choice not to buy healthcare , as it lacks constitutional authorisation to interfere in this aspect of individual americans ' private lives .
Argumentative	 the vertical separation of powers , under which the federal government possesses limited and enumerated powers , while the states wield general powers , including the right to operate their own police forces , is a key part of america 's constitutional architecture .
Argumentative	 far from being an 18th century affectation , these structural limitations on government powers were designed to protect individual liberty .
Argumentative	 in the framers ' view , limiting the ability of the federal government to exercise authority was core to ensuring that no single government entity would grow too powerful .
Argumentative	 this is because , under the supremacy clause , any constitutionally compliant federal legislation trumps exercises of individual state 's powers .
Argumentative	 therefore , an infinitely capacious commerce clause , which would be produced if the mandating of healthcare were to be allowed , would rob states of any remaining authority .
Argumentative	  when any choice or non-action which has economic impacts becomes termed as `` economic '' , every aspect of consumer behaviour , or , for that matter , any aspect of individual behaviour , would become an economic activity , and thus nothing would fall outside of congress ' power to regulate under the commerce clause .
Argumentative	  the individual health insurance mandate would set dangerous precedents for federal power .
Argumentative	 the congressional budget office acknowledged the unprecedented nature of an individual mandate when assessing the clinton health care reform proposal of: `` a mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action .
Argumentative	 the government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the united states .
Argumentative	 an individual mandate has two features that , in combination , make it unique .
Argumentative	 first , it would impose a duty on individuals as members of society .
Argumentative	 second , it would require people to purchase a specific service that would have to be heavily regulated by the federal government . ''
