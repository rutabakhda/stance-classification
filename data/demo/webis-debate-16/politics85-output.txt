Non-Argumentative	government transparency, the idea that government should be open about what it is doing with its citizens, has been around since the enlightenment when parliaments began to be more powerful than kings.
Non-Argumentative	 we usually consider that governmental transparency is a part of good governance in a democracy.
Non-Argumentative	 this is in part because we consider information to be a public good.
Non-Argumentative	 every citizen should have the ability to find out what their government is doing on their behalf.
Non-Argumentative	 in theory this really should apply to everything the government does; from transparency in what the government does with rubbish, through how elections are fought and lobbying processes, right up to military.
Non-Argumentative	 clearly it would be unreasonable if national security were to be excluded where all the rest of government has to be more transparent.
Non-Argumentative	unfortunately there have always been snags when it comes to national security and transparency.
Non-Argumentative	 being transparent means letting everyone know about something, it is then clearly impossible to restrict knowledge simply to the citizens of one particular nation, so transparency means transparency with everyone else’s citizens too.
Non-Argumentative	 in areas like rubbish collection this does not matter, but in national security it does.
Non-Argumentative	 as a result the state often claims ‘national security’ as a reason for why something has to remain secret.
Non-Argumentative	 this means that while the rest of government has been opening up as a result of freedom of information laws these laws tend to exempt information that “is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security” or if disclosure would prejudice defence or “the capability, effectiveness or security of any relevant forces.”
Non-Argumentative	yet it is becoming more difficult to keep secrets, to the point that it has been suggested that there will be no more secrets withinyears.
Non-Argumentative	 the internet changes this relationship fundamentally.
Non-Argumentative	 it provides immense communication and data advantages that security services can take advantage of.
Non-Argumentative	 but at the same time it means that others are likely to be able to obtain information the government wants to keep secret.
Non-Argumentative	 not engaging in transparency might therefore simply limit access to those who don’t have the knowledge and capabilities to engage in the hacking necessary to gain access to it.
Non-Argumentative	 the internet has also changed the realm of whistleblowing.
Non-Argumentative	 wikileaks has shown that information that the government considered to be part of its security interest can, and will, be leaked and often much of what is being considered secret cannot be justified on national security grounds.
Non-Argumentative	this will not stop the state trying.
Non-Argumentative	 conflict in particular breeds secrecy and the latest conflict western democracies are involved in, the war on terrorism, is no different.
Non-Argumentative	 there being some kind of enemy is exactly what the government needs to justify secrecy.
Non-Argumentative	 the question then that this debate explores is how justified it is to not be transparent in the realm of security.
Argumentative	 the most essential commodity within a state is trust .
Argumentative	 trust is essential in all sorts of aspect of our lives ; we trust that the paper money we have is actually worth more than a scrap of paper , that doctors performing surgery know what they are doing , that we wo n't be attacked in the street , and that the government is looking after our interests .
Argumentative	 in order to create that trust there needs to be transparency so that we know that our institutions are trustworthy .
Argumentative	 it is the ability to check the facts and the accountability that comes with transparency that creates trust .
Argumentative	 and this in turn is what makes them legitimate .
Argumentative	 the need for trust applies just as much to security as any other walk of life .
Argumentative	 citizens need to trust that the security services really are keeping them safe , are spending taxpayers ' money wisely , and are acting in a fashion that is a credit to the country .
Argumentative	 unfortunately if there is not transparency there is no way of knowing if this is the case and so often the intelligence services have turned out to be an embarrassment .
Argumentative	 as has been the case with the cia and it 's the use of torture following 9/11 , for which there are still calls for transparency on past actions .
Argumentative	 the nation exits for its citizens ; it depends on their consent to maintain order and to raise finances .
Argumentative	 the main purpose of the state is law and order , and national defence , both of which are covered by security .
Argumentative	 as an area that is so central to the role of the government it is vital that the stakeholders in that government , its citizens , know what it is the state is doing in their name for their security .
Argumentative	 the obama administration for example refuses to acknowledge that it is carrying out a campaign using drones while at the same time saying it is `` the only game in town in terms of confronting and trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . ''
Argumentative	 if the us government is bombing another country then the us people have a right to know with much less ambiguity what exactly is being done , who is being hit , when and where .
Argumentative	 they also need to be informed of any possible consequences .
Argumentative	 transparency is necessary in international relations .
Argumentative	 states need to know what each other are doing to assess their actions .
Argumentative	 without any transparency the hole is filled by suspicion and threat inflation that can easily lead to miscalculation and even war .
Argumentative	 the cuban missile crisis is a clear example where a lack of transparency on either side about what they were willing to accept and what they were doing almost lead to nuclear war .
Argumentative	 it is notable that one of the responses to prevent a similar crisis was to install a hotline between the white house and kremlin .
Argumentative	 a very small , but vital , step in terms of openness .
Argumentative	 today this is still a problem ; china currently worries about the us ` pivot ' towards asia complaining it `` has aroused a great deal of suspicion in china . ''
Argumentative	 `` a huge deficit of strategic trust lies at the bottom of all problems between china and the united states . ''
Argumentative	 the result would be an inevitable arms race and possible conflict .
Argumentative	 transparency is fundamental in making sure that mistakes do n't happen , or when they do that they are found and corrected quickly with appropriate accountability .
Argumentative	 this applies as much , if not more , to the security apparatus than other walks of life .
Argumentative	 in security mistakes are much more likely to be a matter of life and death than in most other walks of life .
Argumentative	 they are also likely to be costly ; something the military and national security apparatus is particularly known for .
Argumentative	 an audit of the pentagon infound that the us department of defense wasted $billion over two years .
Argumentative	 this kind of waste can only be corrected if it is found out about , and for that transparency is necessary .
Argumentative	 transparency is necessary to avoid public relations disasters ; particularly in countries where the media has some freedom to investigate for themselves .
Argumentative	 it is clearly the best policy for the military to make sure all the information is released along with the reasons behind actions rather than having the media finding individual pieces of a whole and speculating to fill the gaps .
Argumentative	 a good example would be a collision on 16th januarybetween a b-52 bomber and a kc-135 tanker while attempting to refuel that destroyed both planes .
Argumentative	 accidents happen , and this one costlives , but could have been much worse as the b-52 had four nuclear bombs on board were not armed and did not detonate .
Argumentative	 in this case an initial lack of information rapidly turned into a public relations disaster that was stemmed by much more openness by the military and the us ambassador in spain .
Argumentative	 the release of the information reduces the room for the press to fill in the gaps with harmful speculation .
Argumentative	 in this case there was never much chance of national security implications or a break with spain as the country was ruled by the dictator franco , someone who would hardly pay attention to public opinion .
Argumentative	 but in a democracy a slow and closed response could seriously damage relations .
