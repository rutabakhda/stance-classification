Non-Argumentative	the uefa eurotournament is being jointly hosted by poland and ukraine.
Non-Argumentative	 the football is scheduled to start on 8th june with a match between poland and greece and it will run until 1st july.
Non-Argumentative	 the final will be held in the olympic stadium in kyiv the capital of ukraine.
Non-Argumentative	 this will put ukraine in the spotlight throughout the tournament as leaders regularly attend international tournaments to show their support for their national team and sometimes engage in some international diplomacy on the side.
Non-Argumentative	 there have however been calls for europe’s leaders to not attend, to boycott, those games that are to be held in ukraine.
Non-Argumentative	  german chancellor angela merkel has been campaigning for a mass boycott by european leaders and she has been joined by the austrians.
Non-Argumentative	 others such as the european commission president barroso and british foreign minister william hague have said they will be staying away without explicitly stating that they are boycotting the tournament.
Non-Argumentative	 the furore has been caused by the conviction of yulia timoshenko on charges of criminally exceeding her authority over a 10-year gas contract signed with russia in january 2009.
Non-Argumentative	 timoshenko and her supporters claim it was a politically motivated show trial and an attempt by the president of ukraine viktor yanukovych to prevent his main rival from contesting elections in the future.
Non-Argumentative	 timoshenko went on hunger strike in april having accused prison guards of beating her and fearing that the ukrainian authorities would attempt to have her killed.
Non-Argumentative	 although timoshenko ended her hunger strike on 9th may the international fallout continues.
Argumentative	 viktor yanukovych fairly came to power inhowever since then he has set about attacking the country 's fragile democracy .
Argumentative	 there are numerous cases showing this democratic decline .
Argumentative	 for example changes to the constitution that occurred after the orange revolution have been rolled back to give more power to the presidency .
Argumentative	 most visibly opponents of the regime such as yulia timoshenko have been jailed in politically motivated trials .
Argumentative	 at the same time there have been attacks on the freedom of the media and ukraine has fallen down rankings of press freedom in 2010-11 with its score from freedom house falling fromtowith its ranking falling to 130th .
Argumentative	 ukraine , like its neighbours russia and belarus , has become a ` virtual mafia state ' where the sbu , ukraine 's successor to the kgb , is all powerful and the elite are unaccountable .
Argumentative	 it is becoming more and more corrupt as is shown by its fall down the corruption perceptions index from 118th into 152nd in.
Argumentative	 ukraine is clearly going in the wrong direction and european leaders need to stand up and show that the will not allow this to continue .
Argumentative	 european leaders must take a stand on human rights in their own back yard if they are to be taken seriously on the issue anywhere in the world .
Argumentative	 there are numerous human rights abuses in ukraine ; migrants `` risk abusive treatment and arbitrary detention '' , roma and people with dark skin in particular face governmental and societal discrimination and some xenophobic attacks and may be prosecuted for acting in self defense .
Argumentative	 amnesty international has highlighted abuse of power by the police `` numerous cases in eurohost cities in which police have tortured people in an attempt to extort money , extract a confession , or simply because of the victims ' sexuality or ethnic origin '' .
Argumentative	 if europe turns a blind eye to these kinds of abuses in neighbouring states without even a minor diplomatic snub it will not have the moral authority to confront worse abuses elsewhere in the world .
Argumentative	 states that are abusing their own citizens would shrug off criticism believing that european states will not back their criticism up with any action .
Argumentative	 diplomacy is necessary with any regime almost no matter how oppressive they are however that does not show approval of a regime to the world in the way that high profile visits and events can .
Argumentative	 just as the beijing olympics were the people 's republic of china 's coming out party so eurois an ideal chance for ukraine to show itself off to europe and the rest of the world .
Argumentative	 if there was not a boycott this would implicitly show that europe approves of ukraine and the actions of its government .
Argumentative	 in a list of possible diplomatic responses that range from verbal diplomatic complaints right up to sanctions a boycott represents a mid-point .
Argumentative	 a boycott is perhaps the best action that the european union leaders could take is it takes away the shine that the event would otherwise give the yanukovych .
Argumentative	 it will be denying him the political benefits of the euros while highlighting rights concerns .
Argumentative	 a boycott is also proportional because it gives ukraine 's leaders a chance to reform before beginning any further measures that would have a much deeper effect on diplomatic relations .
