Non-Argumentative	the international monetary fund (imf) is an intergovernmental organization that was set up into oversee the global financial system by keeping in check its members’ balance of payments and the strength of their currency.
Non-Argumentative	 it hasmembers to date.
Non-Argumentative	 it also offers loans, mainly to its poorer members, that are usually accompanied by firm requirements to implement neoliberal economic policies, like cutting public spending and lowering corporate tax rates to balance budgets and reduce deficits.
Non-Argumentative	 the members of the imf have different numbers of votes, according to their ‘quotas’, which are calculated according to the financial contributions they make to the fund and their share of the world economy.
Non-Argumentative	  the imf’s main governing organ is an executive board comprised ofexecutive directors,directly appointed by the five states with the largest quotas (us, japan, germany, france, uk), andelected by the rest of the member states.
Non-Argumentative	 the executive board has the task of confirming the selection for managing director, the head of the imf.
Non-Argumentative	 due to a historical agreement, a european has always held this role, with the second in command from the united states.
Non-Argumentative	 however, this convention is increasingly being called into question, as well as the western countries’ dominant share of the total number of votes and decision-making powers within the organization.
Argumentative	the proposal is to reweigh the quota system, ensuring the balance of power reflects the growth in the share of world economic activity now accounted for by brics and formerly developing countries.
Argumentative	the decisions taken by the imf have a deep impact on the entire global financial system and on developing countries in particular , whose economies are especially sensitive to global changes .
Argumentative	 yet , the western , developed countries have the greatest sway in the decision-making process , with developing countries having little influence over the process .
Argumentative	 it creates an unjust financial world order , where rich and powerful countries call the shots and smaller , poorer ones bear the consequences .
Argumentative	 claims that power within the imf is distributed according to the reality of the members ' weight in the global financial system are inaccurate .
Argumentative	 the imf reflects the financial system as it wasyears ago and has done little to acknowledge the growth of countries like brazil , russia , india , and china , brics , which have far fewer votes than their economic heft merits , while western countries like belgium are actually overrepresented .
Argumentative	 significant reforms to the voting quotas need to be implemented in order to create an imf that is true to the reality of the world financial system .
Argumentative	 western dominance leads to economic policies and loan conditions rooted in neoliberal economic principles , like austerity measures , which overemphasize cutting public spending .
Argumentative	 these often actually end up badly hurting developing economies , increasing inequalities and poverty , malawi is a prominent example .
Argumentative	 argentina 's economic collapse attests to that .
Argumentative	 since western countries do not suffer from food shortages , they do not understand how vital food and access to healthcare is for survival in the developing world .
Argumentative	 the imf treats food and healthcare in its policies just like any other commodity on the market , sometimes with disastrous humanitarian consequences .
