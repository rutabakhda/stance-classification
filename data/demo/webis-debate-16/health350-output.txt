Non-Argumentative	alcohol has been part of the culture of recreation for thousands of years, it is also a dangerous substance.
Non-Argumentative	 as such, almost all countries place an age restriction on it.
Non-Argumentative	 the few exceptions where there is no minimum drinking age include albania, vietnam and cambodia.
Non-Argumentative	 while the us and uk have comparatively high drinking ages ofandrespectively, some european countries allow drinking at a younger age; usually around(at least for beer, if not for spirits).
Non-Argumentative	 the purpose of a minimum drinking age is to act as a deterrent from drinking alcohol, as young people face legal punishment if they break the law by drinking underage.
Non-Argumentative	 supposedly, this deterrent helps to preserve the overall health and safety of young people until they reach an age where they are considered responsible enough to regulate their own drinking.
Non-Argumentative	    however, underage drinking remains a problem.
Non-Argumentative	 the law is often difficult to enforce if people drink in their own homes, rather than in a public place.
Non-Argumentative	 though establishments such as bars or supermarkets often have a policy to ask for identification when selling alcohol in the uk, levels of sales to minors are still not considered to be low enough.
Non-Argumentative	 so far, the minimum drinking age in the uk and the us has failed to stop some minors from obtaining alcohol.
Non-Argumentative	            the mechanism for this debate is simple: passing a law to change the legal drinking age.
Non-Argumentative	 for the us, this could be changing fromto 18; for the uk, fromto 16; for other european countries, considering thatis now a common drinking age,would also be suitable here.
Non-Argumentative	 in any of these particular settings, the principle arguments remain the same.
Non-Argumentative	            the proposition might also choose to tie in extra conditions to the mechanism, for example raising tax on harder forms of alcohol like spirits, or on youth-targeted alcoholic drinks like alcopops, to deter excessive drinking by young people after the law is passed.
Non-Argumentative	 studies have also found that higher taxes on alcohol can noticeably reduce the number of accidents and violent incidents.
Non-Argumentative	 another mechanism tie-in would be to state that tax money gained from the sale of alcohol to young people who can now legally drink will be funded back into educational schemes to promote responsible drinking, or in worst case to cover the costs of medical treatment or criminal damage committed.
Non-Argumentative	 it may be useful to point out the analogy to smoking.
Non-Argumentative	 though smoking results in a lot of medical conditions (and a hefty economic strain on the nhs in the uk), the tax money from cigarettes ‘more than pays for’ the cost of healthcare for people who get cancer from smoking.
Argumentative	 by imposing a high drinking age in the us and the uk , illegal drinking is seen as even more attractive because it is exclusive .
Argumentative	 for many teenagers , underage drinking is seen as a way to gain respect from their peers and appear ` cool ' , or to feel ` more at ease in social situations ' .
Argumentative	 the very fact that it is illegal makes it a target for teenagers to gain social status by drinking , as is true for other illegal substances such as marijuana .
Argumentative	 because it is harder to get , when young people do manage to obtain alcohol they tend to have high rates of binge-drinking .
Argumentative	 lowering the drinking age would remove this illicit appeal and encourage people to drink more moderately when they do drink .
Argumentative	 if the drinking age were lowered , the perceived ` need ' to binge drink would be removed too .
Argumentative	 asurvey showed that , in the us , there was a higher rate of binge drinking among high school students , 41.8 % , who reported current alcohol use than among adults where , even in high-risk categories , binge-drinking rates did not rise above 25.6 % .
Argumentative	 limited alcohol consumption can actually be beneficial for a person 's health , and is linked to ` a lower risk of coronary heart disease in healthy men and women ' .
Argumentative	 the drinking age should be lowered to remove the glamorisation of alcohol and resultant binge drinking , and instead focus on frequent but moderate alcohol consumption .
Argumentative	 while the current drinking age isin the uk andin the us , both countries grant other legal rights to people below this age .
Argumentative	 for example , both countries grant the right to have sex or join the army at a lower age than this .
Argumentative	 this recognition of maturity should also encompass the right to drink ; if young people are responsible enough to fight for their country or have sex , they should be responsible enough to have a drink .
Argumentative	 in any case , studies show that many underage young people have tried alcohol ; it is clear that the current legal restrictions do not work .
Argumentative	 surveys at east carolina university in the us found that when the drinking age was raised fromto,% of students reported that they ` intended to use other drugs ' as drinking became illegal for people of their age .
Argumentative	 meanwhile , in arizona , surveys before and after the drinking age was raised fromtofound no reduction in alcohol consumption among their students .
Argumentative	 raising the drinking age , therefore , does not necessarily mean a reduction in alcohol consumption , and more worryingly could push people towards other substances which are dangerous and difficult to regulate or police .
Argumentative	 the legal system should acknowledge high rates of underage drinking and change to reflect the reality of drinking patterns .
