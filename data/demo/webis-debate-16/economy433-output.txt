Non-Argumentative	a minimum wage is the minimum price at which firms may hire workers, and conversely at which individuals can sell their labor.
Non-Argumentative	 the government usually sets the minimum wage level at a point that will increase the wages of the lowest earners.
Non-Argumentative	 new zealand was the first country to set any kind of minimum wage law when it established arbitration boards in the industrial conciliation and arbitration act of 1894.
Non-Argumentative	 there is now some kind of minimum wage or collective bargaining legislation over the minimum wage in more than 90% of countries.
Non-Argumentative	 there are however large differences in terms of the level of the minimum and how it is set.
Non-Argumentative	 the united kingdom for example has a national minimum wage set at £5.93 per hour for workers overyears old with lower rates for younger people.
Non-Argumentative	 there is another group of countries that do not have national minimum wages but do have collectively agreed minimum wages.
Non-Argumentative	 these are usually decided per sector, countries that use this form of collective bargaining to set minimum wages include german and italy.
Non-Argumentative	 a few countries such as macedonia have no minimum wage at all.
Non-Argumentative	 opponents of the minimum wage argue that everything should be left to the free market and use supply and demand theory to argue that unemployment will be the result of a minimum, as firms will be unwilling to pay the extra price for workers.
Non-Argumentative	 proponents however instead focus on social justice and the exploitation of workers, particularly the most vulnerable.
Argumentative	 businesses operating in a free market are concerned principally with their bottom lines .
Argumentative	 in order to increase profits , firms will seek to exploit workers , to lower wages as far as possible .
Argumentative	 this exploitation will continue indefinitely , unless the state intervenes .
Argumentative	 the state does so by implementing a minimum wage .
Argumentative	 the lowest paid workers tend to be less educated , less skilled , and less organized than higher-paid employees .
Argumentative	 this makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace .
Argumentative	 in order to stop this outright exploitation of the most vulnerable members of society , the power of wage setting must fall to some extent within the purview of the state .
Argumentative	 certainly , it is far better for state , which has citizens ' best interest at heart , to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses , which tend not to care about their workers ' welfare or have competing interests .
Argumentative	 furthermore , a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation ; it affirms that all people have worth , can not be exploited , and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce , i.e. a minimum wage .
Argumentative	 this is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society , by encouraging them to value themselves .
Argumentative	 also , the minimum wage aids in promoting social justice and equality by lowering wage disparities .
Argumentative	 citizens of more equal societies tend to have more in common and can share more in the construction of societal goals and aims .
Argumentative	 this form of social justice is certainly preferable to the class divisions propagated in the absence of a minimum wage , in which a part of society is relegated to permanent wage slavery .
Argumentative	 without a minimum wage , the lowest paid members of society are relegated to effective serfdom , and their decisions of these members often force others to follow suit , accepting similarly low wages .
Argumentative	 there is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure , since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families .
Argumentative	 their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages .
Argumentative	 the minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices .
Argumentative	 without resources there can be no true choice , as all choices would be coerced by necessity .
Argumentative	 because people 's choices are intrinsically interconnected , and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply , when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else , he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask , leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another , each competing to prove he is worth the least .
Argumentative	 a minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition .
Argumentative	 what the minimum wage does to alleviate these problems is that it gives individuals the ability to pursue the good life , something that has become a global ideal .
Argumentative	 people want to be happy , and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment .
Argumentative	 fundamentally , the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited , giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies .
Argumentative	 employees work harder when they are paid more , but employers can often be more concerned with the short-term bottom line and will not treat workers in the lowest echelons of their firms with much consideration , viewing them instead as disposable and replaceable economic units .
Argumentative	 mandating a minimum wage can thus benefit firms , even if they do not recognize it , by making workers more productive and also fostering a general work ethic .
Argumentative	 as workers feel more valued in the economic system , the more likely they are to work loyally and diligently for their employers .
Argumentative	 furthermore , better pay means more disposable income in the hands of employees , which leads to greater demand by them for goods and services .
Argumentative	 this demand-induced economic growth is a very important part of economic growth .
Argumentative	 the more people are able to spend , the more money flows into the economy , leading to more business and higher employment .
Argumentative	 without the minimum wage , a downward spiral of spending can ensue , proving deleterious to firms and the economy generally .
Argumentative	 additionally , the minimum wage decreases expensive social welfare payments , since workers no longer need as many supplements to their wages from the state in order to make up for the shortfall created by too-low wages .
Argumentative	 when wages are extremely low the incentive to enter alternative markets is increased .
Argumentative	 this is particularly harmful in the case of illegal markets , such as those for drugs or prostitution .
Argumentative	 when there is little to be gained from obtaining a legitimate job , no matter how plentiful they might be in the absence of a minimum wage , they would be undesirable by comparison to potentially highly lucrative black market opportunities .
Argumentative	 the minimum wage is essential for keeping the opportunity cost of entering the black market sufficiently high that people opt always to enter the mainstream , legal market .
Argumentative	 furthermore , when the possibility of work in the legitimate market exists , even if work is harder to find due to a minimum wage , the very possibility of getting such a job will serve as a disincentive to pursuing illegal employment .
