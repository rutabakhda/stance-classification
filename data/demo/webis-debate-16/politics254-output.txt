Non-Argumentative	nato is an alliance ofstates from europe and north america.
Non-Argumentative	 it was founded inat the start of the cold war to provide for the collective defense of its members, and for much of its history was focused on the military threat posed by the forces of the soviet union and the warsaw pact.
Non-Argumentative	 since the end of the cold war in 1989, the direct military threat to nato’s european member states has substantially diminished and nato has transformed itself to additionally include crisis management beyond its borders and collective security amongst its tasks.
Non-Argumentative	 this requires substantial investment by its member states to modernize their armed forces to be deployable and sustainable overseas.
Non-Argumentative	 more recently, the long term effects of the global financial crisis have underlined the strain that defense expenditure puts on the governments of the member states.
Non-Argumentative	 and, under the terms of nato’s treaty, its european member states should still be able to expect military assistance from the united states and canada in the event of an attack.
Non-Argumentative	  should nato’s european members reduce their armed forces?
Argumentative	 the threat of a direct military attack on the european member states is very remote .
Argumentative	 as nato 's new strategic concept acknowledges : `` today , the euro-atlantic area is at peace and the threat of a conventional attack against nato territory is low . ''
Argumentative	 nato troops are involved only in crises abroad , such as the war in afghanistan and nato 's intervention in libya .
Argumentative	 these operations do not affect the security of the member states -- they have no need to maintain expensive armed forces to fight such ` wars of choice ' or to help others when there are problems at home .
Argumentative	 further , the money that the member states spend participating in such operations could be better spent on things that would really help in these regions -- such as development aid .
Argumentative	 the commitment to collective defense remains a core purpose of the alliance .
Argumentative	 articleof the nato treaty specifically states : `` the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . ''
Argumentative	 the treaty goes on to state that nato states will use the full force necessary to defend against such an attack .
Argumentative	 this commitment was recently reaffirmed in nato 's new strategic concept : `` nato members will always assist each other against attack , in accordance with articleof the washington treaty .
Argumentative	 that commitment remains firm and binding . ''
Argumentative	 furthermore , nato has already backed up its words with actions : when articlewas invoked on september following the attacks on new york and washington , nato agreed on , and delivered , a package of measures to support the united states .
Argumentative	 and the united states , which has the largest armed forces among the allies is also firm in its commitment to defending other nato allies .
Argumentative	 for example , rose gottemoeller , u.s. assistant secretary of state for verification , stated on a visit to lithuania : `` the point that i can most clearly repeat and underscore today for you is that nato will protect nato ... i know that is a view that is shared by all nato allies that nato will protect nato '' .
Argumentative	 so , it seems clear that nato would defend its european member states if they were attacked , allowing them an opportunity to reduce their armed forces .
Argumentative	 if nato needed to step in to defend europe , it would be able to call on substantial armed forces .
Argumentative	 according to gareth evans , chancellor of the australian national university , nato has `` a formidable war-fighting and peace enforcement capacity , in terms not only of the raw numbers of both personnel , some 2.5 million in uniform , and equipment , over 5,000 helicopters for a start , but also their interoperability , highly professional and integrated military command structure . ''
Argumentative	 indeed , nato has shown itself to be effective in the past .
Argumentative	 evans again argues , `` nato has demonstrated in more recent years considerable competence in the actual conduct of military operations , '' citing the operations in kosovo in, bosnia fromto, and afghanistan since.
Argumentative	 given this substantial capability , there can be little justification for continued high levels of defense spending in europe .
Argumentative	 given that nato members will defend one another , and that `` three nato members -- the united states , britain and france - between them deploy more than 10,000 nuclear weapons , '' conventional wars are extremely unlikely .
Argumentative	 as professor kenneth waltz argues , `` wars can be fought in the face of deterrent threats , but the higher the stakes and the closer a country moves toward winning them , the more surely that country invites retaliation and risks its own destruction .
Argumentative	 states are not likely to run major risks for minor gains . ''
Argumentative	 no likely aggressor is likely to be able to make such gains against europe as to make the risk of nuclear war worth the risk .
Argumentative	 given that most nato members have been in a deep recession , and direct military threats to their territories are unlikely , it only makes sense to cut defense expenditure .
Argumentative	 in the uk , for example , gaby hinsliff noted , `` as a result of the costs of borrowing through a recession , in five years ' time the national debt is forecast to reach # 1.3 trillion '' -- clearly , nato members have more pressing concerns than keeping up superfluous armies .
Argumentative	 currently , britain spends over% of its gdp on defense , and secretary of state for defence liam fox recently admitted that the mission in libya may cost the uk up to #million .
Argumentative	 with a growing military cost for ammunition , wages and supplies , such as food , nato members can afford no course of action other than cutting their armed forces costs .
