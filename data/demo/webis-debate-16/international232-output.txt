Non-Argumentative	popular demonstrations started in syria in march and aprilas part of the arab spring movement that swept across large areas of the middle east.
Non-Argumentative	 this deteriorated in to a civil war.
Non-Argumentative	both sides, the assad government and to a lesser extent the rebels, have been accused of grave human rights abuses.
Non-Argumentative	 this includes including the use of chemical weapons against civilians, most likely by the assad regime as they are the ones with control over chemical weapons, as well as the deliberate targeted killing of civilians, and widespread rapes.
Non-Argumentative	 the rebels have been accused of summary killings of soldiers and civilians they have captured, including an incident caught on video where a boy, whose age would make him a child soldier under the rome statute, kills a syrian colonel with a machete.
Non-Argumentative	this has led to calls for military intervention by the us and france, with some support from the british government, who lost a parliamentary vote on the issue.
Non-Argumentative	 this is a course of action opposed by china and russia.
Non-Argumentative	however, there have been suggestions, including by the british government and human rights watch that the case should be referred to the international criminal court to put various figures in the conflict, likely including bashar al-assad on trial.
Non-Argumentative	 if he were to go on trial at the icc, he would be one of a small number of former heads of state, including charles taylor and slobodan milosevic, to have been tried before an international court.
Non-Argumentative	neither syria, or lebanon, which is being affected by overspill of the conflict, have ratified the rome statute to the international criminal court.
Non-Argumentative	 therefore, in order for this to be added to the jurisdiction of the icc, a reference by the un security council would be necessary.
Argumentative	Â the purpose of the icc is to be the venue for the implementation of international criminal law , a principle that the international community has supported since the creation of the icty and ictr and prior to that .
Argumentative	 the crimes that the court is to prosecute include genocide -- which is probably not occurring but has been alleged , crimes against humanity and war crimes -- which have certainly happened the chemical attacks being just one among many examples .
Argumentative	 the allegations against the assad regime are serious -- including the use of chemical weapons , which are specifically mentioned as a war crime under article 8/1/b / xviii the rome statute .
Argumentative	 it would set a terrible precedent for such crimes to not be punished under international criminal law .
Argumentative	 the icc has a high level of soft power in this case .
Argumentative	 it has the resources to investigate and prosecute , backed up by widespread support from large swathes of the international community .
Argumentative	 the icc is part of a growing international norm against war and crimes against humanity .
Argumentative	 the willingness to prosecute for these crimes -- particularly if it is done consistently -- will build norms where even ruthless leaders realise they ca n't get away with such crimes .
Argumentative	 pursuing war crimes from the syrian conflict alone will not be enough but when combined with similar measures elsewhere and the arrests of other leaders such as charles taylor , slobodan milosevic and laurent gbagbo show that even leaders are no longer out of reach of international law .
Argumentative	 the icc could act as an effective deterrent to the use of chemical weapons and other war crimes by threatening to prosecute individuals who commit them .
Argumentative	 the use of the icc could work better than domestic show trials in the aftermath of a civil war .
Argumentative	 instead of domestic courts , prone to all their biases , an international , unbiased , criminal system could replace the prospect of a ceausescu-style non-trial followed by summary execution , or some other form of unfair trial which could sow the seeds for problems down the line .
Argumentative	 even the trial of iraqi dictator saddam hussein done while the united states had a lot of influence over the country as a result of its occupation was condemned as having `` serious administrative , procedural and substantive legal defects '' .
Argumentative	 instead , an icc trial would allow the full details to be probed , investigated and independently prosecuted without being subject to domestic post-war recriminations .
Argumentative	 the un security council has so far been undecided over any future action in syria .
Argumentative	 china has so far been unconvinced over any action .
Argumentative	 russia has supported assad , selling the assad regime arms .
Argumentative	 russia and china , being permanent members of the unsc means that they can block any action on this issue that the other permanent members , usa , uk and france , may wish to bring for any form of sanction towards the assad regime .
Argumentative	 while it may not be possible to get russia to support a military intervention , which is something that they are opposed to , it may be possible to swing russia round to a position where they abstain on a reference to the icc .
Argumentative	 russia has had a flexible , or , more cynically , hypocritical , view on the icc before , opposing a syria reference in februarybut supporting one in to the actions of nato in the syrian conflict , position on the icc , having voted in favour of references to it before .
Argumentative	 because the involvement of the icc would mean investigating both sides it would not be entirely impossible for a diplomatic solution to be reached for russia to abstain on a reference .
