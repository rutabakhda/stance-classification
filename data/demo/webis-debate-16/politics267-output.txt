Non-Argumentative	 impartial civil services, such as the crown’s civil service in the uk, may require their staff to refrain from participating in public and high profile political campaigning.
Non-Argumentative	 alternately some executive branches may employ their own, partisan administrative staff.

Non-Argumentative	public debate following the leak quickly became focussed on whether governments have a right to vet the political beliefs and associations of their employees.
Non-Argumentative	screening of employees political beliefs seems especially pertinent in states where free speech laws allow citizens to freely associate with political groups opposed to the protection of free speech and other core constitutional principles.

Non-Argumentative	 similar rules apply in new zealand and in northern ireland.
Argumentative	  government employees are , ultimately , duty bound to uphold the policies and principles implemented by the executive branch .
Argumentative	 the executive is limited in its range of action -- it is necessary to delegate certain of its duties to bodies such as the police , the military and the education services .
Argumentative	 as representatives of the government , employees whom obstruct or attempt to subvert the laws that it implements are effectively obstructing the liberal autonomy of the fellow citizens .
Argumentative	 the executive is elected and empowered on the basis that it will bring about certain changes to law and society that have been mandated by the electorate .
Argumentative	 the executive is also given the authority to act to fulfil broader , more aspiration goals that echo the desires and objectives of society as a whole .
Argumentative	 at every stage in its life cycle , a state remains democratically accountable .
Argumentative	 politicians undertake to set personal ambition aside and to act as representatives of the popular will -- their own values and political beliefs take second place to the beliefs articulated by the electorate .
Argumentative	 a government would be completely ineffective , and would rapidly loose the confidence of the electorate if it enacted policies according to the personal preference of its members .
Argumentative	 similarly , the groups and individuals to whom the government 's power is delegated can also undermine its mandate if they also refuse to impartially implemented democratically sanctioned laws and policies .
Argumentative	 political parties also function as peer networks .
Argumentative	 membership of a party gives individuals a certain sense of belonging and allows them to influence and define the identity of other members .
Argumentative	 members of extremist parties who do not want to use their position to promote extreme views are likely to come under pressure from other party members to do so .
Argumentative	 even if a member of an extremist party vows that he will not abuse his role as a teacher or a civil servant , others who share his beliefs will try to convince him to do so .
Argumentative	 allowing teachers and youth leaders to be members of extremist political groups presents a significant risk to children and young adults .
Argumentative	 there is , of course , an unsubtle point to be made about the possibility that teachers with extremist views may attempt to indoctrinate their charges .
Argumentative	 teachers hold positions of respect and authority within educational institutions .
Argumentative	 they are trusted uncritically ; they are tasked with providing children with the cognitive tools that they will use to evaluate the beliefs and controversies they will encounter throughout their lives .
Argumentative	 teachers can be a source of inspiration and can foster aspiration .
Argumentative	 teachers may also engage in racial motivated bullying among their peers , disrupting the confidence and authority of their colleagues .
Argumentative	 attacks and bias of this type often prove hard to detect , as many racial minorities contain disproportionately large numbers of vulnerable families and children .
Argumentative	 whether put at risk by economic and cultural marginalisation or by the legal and political quagmire surrounding the status of non eu migrants , the children of minority groups are often confronted with wide ranging and institutionalised prejudice outside of the classroom environment .
Argumentative	 it is not acceptable to expose them to the danger of racial discrimination by their teachers .
Argumentative	 it is often unclear whether extremist political organisations are likely to become violent or to engage in provocative acts of hate speech .
Argumentative	 although the state does not have a right to obstruct or prevent such organisations from meeting or protesting , it does have a right to control the manner and circumstances in which such meetings take place .
Argumentative	 doing so ensures that citizens who do not want to be involved in , or whose activities and freedoms might be materially affected by the articulation of extremist views can go about their business without hindrance .
Argumentative	 part of the state 's role is to balance these sets of incommensurate rights .
Argumentative	 all western liberal democracies use their police forces to enforce this balance .
Argumentative	 it is possible that a conflict of interest could arise between the political views of a police officer or a state solicitor responsible for overseeing the circumstances in which a rally or gathering will take place and the balancing role of the state .
Argumentative	 a police officer with links to an extremist party may , conceivably , be made responsible for policing the conduct of friends and political allies .
Argumentative	 if such a situation was to arise , the capability of the officer to make appropriately impartial , value neutral decisions about the types of activity that would be permitted at such a demonstration might be compromised .
Argumentative	 even if the officer expressly adopts a neutral stance , personal ideological bias may still lead him to perceive a demonstration by his friends and allies as inherently less threatening or in need of oversight than a protest mounted by another organisation .
Argumentative	 not only will this undermine the police 's ability to supervise and regulate individual 's democratic rights , it will also have an impact on the perspective that ordinary people adopt in relation to the state .
Argumentative	 marginalised citizens may be less willing to approach police officer 's for help if they are aware that their bias 's go unchallenged .
Argumentative	 one of the causes of the marginalisation of minority groups is bias in service provision among civilian service providers -- suspicion of similar bias amongst the police may create a culture of distrust among many minority groups .
