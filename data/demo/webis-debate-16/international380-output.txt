Non-Argumentative	the european union has been since its foundation been a hybrid between an intergovernmental organization (igo) and supranational federation (sf).
Non-Argumentative	 one of the most notable differences between these two establishments is in the ‘attitude’ towards their member states.
Non-Argumentative	 while igo honors members’ sovereignty, sf puts forward collective spirit (in terms of rule of majority).
Non-Argumentative	 these are also best represented by preferred voting procedures – igo uses unanimity requirement and sf the vote of majority (currently, eu exercises qualified majority voting – in areas such as education, environment and economic and monetary policy implementation [1] [2]).
Non-Argumentative	the unanimity requirement (effectively a veto power) is set as a default voting procedure for the most important issues dealt with in the eu (these are, for instance, taxation, social security and social protection, foreign and common defence policy) [3].
Non-Argumentative	 however, its usage is being restricted in favor of qualified majority voting, with the treaty of lisbon introducing the most recent reductions.
Non-Argumentative	 the opinions about the usefulness (or harmfulness) of the unanimity requirement greatly differ.
Non-Argumentative	 intergovernmentalists believe that the requirement is enormously important to preserve the sovereign nature of the culturally different members of the eu.
Non-Argumentative	 on the other hand, supranationalists argue that it is exactly because of these vast differences that the unanimity principle hinders the eu.
Non-Argumentative	the movement away from the unanimity requirement (notable in the recent years – treaty of lisbon changedcases of unanimity requirement to qualified majority voting; for instance legal immigration, europol, energy security and emergency humanitarian aid to hot-spots around the globe, the eu budget [4]) might have suggested that it is supranationalists that are correct, but looking at the recent development in the eu-uk relationship it is safe to conclude that any further ‘federalization’ may well cause great britain’s to leave the eu.
Non-Argumentative	 worries that similar scenarios, where attempts for further federalization would cause greater exclusion of multiple other members (such as france, ireland – which both rejected the constitution - or hungary) are justified, and cast grave concerns over the theory that the current situation of the eu could be improved, and in the future prevented by closer federalization.
Non-Argumentative	however, what is there left for the eu in its current state?
Non-Argumentative	 it is indisputable that the greek crisis, caused by lack of fiscal discipline and lack of institutional tools looking out for potential threats, very negatively affected the whole eu.
Non-Argumentative	 is this not a sufficient reason to state that, at least in the monetary union, where problems of one greatly impact all the others, the individual member states are not self-conscious enough to take up on such huge responsibility?
Non-Argumentative	 in 2012, not a single eurozone country met the maastricht criteria (including stable exchange rate, inflation under 1.5%, 3% budget deficit, 60% state debt and low long-term interest rates / see source) [5] that very criteria deemed to judge nation’s ability to adopt euro.
Non-Argumentative	 not sticking to the conditions of membership is now more of a norm than an exception, and allowing the vetoing of decisions attempting to enforce adherence to the rules – such as the maastricht criteria – may well only worsen the situation.
Non-Argumentative	with the complexity of the problem there are hardly any simple solutions to be found.
Non-Argumentative	 good or bad options no longer exist for it is inevitable that with every action taken, there will be repercussions to be dealt with.
Non-Argumentative	 understandably, the focus should be on the long-term prosperity which often causes short-term hardship, making it politically extremely unpopular.
Non-Argumentative	 thus the question arises – will the leaders find the will to look the beast right into the eyes, and take it by horns; is getting rid of the unanimity requirement the only way to do it?

Argumentative	european union has been based on principles of solidarity and mutual help .
Argumentative	 this means that sometimes , in order to ensure the ` greater good ' , one has to forgo a bit of his own self-interest .
Argumentative	 because european union holds togetherculturally and economically different countries , qualified majority voting is sufficient to ensure that no state will be harmed by the decisions made on the international level .
Argumentative	 the fact that some states would like to retain their right of veto undermines the basic principles of the eu because no such process , where a single state is able to prevent majority from adopting a measure can be called democratic .
Argumentative	 it this system the minority , or individual state , can ignore the will of the majority indefinitely .
Argumentative	 moreover , zamora , in sieberson  states that `` international agreement is impossible to obtain when any single participant can block a decision ; to achieve unanimous consent ... a decision must be diluted so as to please everyone , '' concluding that such result is unsatisfactory and prohibits effective functioning of an international organization , mainly in regards to urgent , practical problems .
Argumentative	 unanimous voting provides states seeking additional gains with a tool to actually achieve their egoistic goals .
Argumentative	 in order for the whole union to pass legislation that would be beneficial to all , a single state has power to negotiate further benefits for itself , thus holding up a deal and sometimes making it less beneficial for others .
Argumentative	 similar concerns were expressed in the eu commission white paper on european governance as consensus requirement `` often holds policy-making hostage to national interest '' .
Argumentative	 what is more , such behavior sets dangerous precedents that nations can put national interests in front of communal , effectively deteriorating the cooperative spirit of the eu and eventually destroying it altogether .
Argumentative	 as sieberson claims , such was the case of french objections to the treaty of rome regarding the wider use of qualified majority voting in the fields of agriculture and the internal market .
Argumentative	 in the ` empty chair crisis ' france boycotted council meetings for seven months , until the deal called luxembourg accord was struck .
Argumentative	 `` the luxembourg accord is widely believed to have created a period of stagnation in the community ... paul craig describes this period as `` the prime example of negative intergovernmentalism . ''
Argumentative	 it prevented consolidation of europe and ensured the ec remained intergovernmental by effectively curtailing qualified majority voting as any state could veto by invoking national interests .
Argumentative	 with greece as a trigger , the eurozone and the whole eu have significantly suffered in the last five years as a result of massive and still on-going economic crisis .
Argumentative	 the euro currency is , damaged by the vast differences between individual eurozone members , with respect to their fiscal and monetary policies .
Argumentative	 while some states , commonly referred to as piigs , do have bigger problems with their finances , it is unthinkable for the others to be held responsible when serious issues , such as an inability to pay the debts , arise .
Argumentative	 nevertheless , this was the case with greece , when tens of billions of taxpayers ' money were used to service debts of one irresponsible state .
Argumentative	 despite more than% of private sector debt being cut down by creditors , the threat of greece 's default still lingers in the air .
Argumentative	 getting rid of the unanimity requirement would make europe much more able to respond quickly to crises .
Argumentative	 in the long run it would make negotiations for a federal union much easier , eventually turning it into reality .
Argumentative	 achieving political integration and the abandonment of the veto that would come with it would then enable solutions to economic problems benefiting the whole even it unpalatable to some .
Argumentative	 such position is also taken by jacques attali , a french economist who argues that `` the institutional reform towards a federal europe is necessary to implement a common fiscal and budgetary system . ''
