Non-Argumentative	self-defense involves defending oneself, one's property or the wellbeing of another from physical harm.
Non-Argumentative	 the use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times of danger is available in many jurisdictions, but the interpretation varies widely.
Non-Argumentative	 the self-defense laws of modern states find their origin in the roman law principle of dominium whereby any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the pater familias (head of household), and thus could be defended as such.
Non-Argumentative	 this right is recognized to varying extents in all states, and by the united nations.
Non-Argumentative	 the level of force one may use in self-defense, however, varies between countries, and usually centers around what constitutes "reasonable force", which is a fairly nebulous term in specific application, but relatively straightforward in a broad sense.
Non-Argumentative	 some critics of self-defense law argue that it is outmoded, belonging to an earlier, more barbarous time, while its supporters insist that it remains a necessity in a still dangerous, modern world.
Argumentative	 debates on self-defense revolve around the central question of whether in fact an individual has the right to defend himself his property, and others against physical attack by means of force, or whether exerting force against another, even defensively, is itself a crime.
Argumentative	the state 's primary duty is to protect its citizens , and to maintain order in society .
Argumentative	 to maintain its legitimacy the state must guard the lives , liberty , and property of its citizens , who allow it to curtail their rights in exchange for its protection .
Argumentative	 when crime is committed , it is a failure of the state .
Argumentative	 but crime in the best-run state is a reality .
Argumentative	 to make up for the inadequacies and inevitable shortcomings of the state , which can not be everywhere , individuals need the ability to make up for the shortfall of protection offered by the state .
Argumentative	 this is why self-defense is necessary1 .
Argumentative	 if the state denies the right to self-defense , while providing an inadequate security service , it allows a societal injustice to go uncorrected .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the injustice inflicted by the state is uneven , as people in areas where there are fewer police and higher rates of crime people will of necessity have to resort to self-defense more often .
Argumentative	 this is the case , for example , in inner cities where policing is limited and poverty rates high2 .
Argumentative	 the need for self-defense is clear , since people are left to fend for themselves .
Argumentative	 thus when the state fails people in poorer areas by providing them with inadequate services , it punishes them for trying to redress the failure .

Argumentative	 people must , if the state wants people to retain faith in it and its ability to uphold the principles of justice , see justice as being done .
Argumentative	 justice is not seen when people who defend themselves are punished for the `` crime '' of fighting back against those who would willfully violate their rights .
Argumentative	 when the state punishes people for the `` crime '' of defending themselves , it appears to be taking the side of the wrongdoer .
Argumentative	 it is true that everyone has rights , even criminals , but what is seen when people are punished for defending themselves is a placing of the rights of criminal over those of the real victims , who happened not to take the abuse of their assailants lying down .
Argumentative	 the state sends a grotesque message that people should either meekly acquiesce to the demands of criminals should they threaten them or the people and things they care about , or fight back and be punished for it .
Argumentative	 that is an unconscionable choice that the state can not legitimately expect people to make .
Argumentative	 when the state passes laws that appear unjust , it invites acts of protest , such as jury nullification .
Argumentative	 by challenging the right to self-defense , the state only serves to delegitimize itself and its laws in the eyes of its citizens .
Argumentative	 when an individual is under immediate threat he has every right to defend himself from an aggressor .
Argumentative	 just as when a wild animal threatens someone 's life he has the right to do whatever he can to survive , so too does the individual have the fundamental right to defend himself from another human 's aggressive acts .
Argumentative	 this is a natural law , one that predates the existence of the social contract or the state .
Argumentative	 the right to self-defense extends also to the defense of other people , as it is no less a right for someone to preserve his own existence by any means necessary , but also that of others , particularly those dependent upon him , or otherwise unable to defend themselves .
Argumentative	 furthermore , self-defense must extend to the protection of property , since it is in many ways part of an individual1 .
Argumentative	 a violation of one 's property is a violation of one 's self .
Argumentative	 when burglars and marauders choose to violate these fundamental rights they make the conscious decision to violate other individuals .
Argumentative	 it is just and proper that citizens be permitted to fight back to protect what is theirs by right .

Argumentative	 would-be criminals , when considering the commission of a crime , make an analysis of the likelihood of success and risk to themselves from their potential victims and from the state .
Argumentative	 the incentive to commit crime when it is illegal for people to defend themselves necessarily increases substantially1 .
Argumentative	 even if the criminals assume some people will defend themselves anyway , they also know that people will likely hold back rather than fight .
Argumentative	 denying the right to self-defense leaves innocents at the mercy of criminals who would violate their rights .
Argumentative	 on the other hand , the acknowledgement of the right to self-defense deters crime , as people will be unwilling to risk their own safety in order to commit crimes .

Argumentative	 people will naturally try to defend themselves , their family and their property when attacked .
Argumentative	 it is right that the state should recognize that this is the case and that this will sometimes involve applying force against an intruder .
Argumentative	 the current situation of allowing `` reasonable force '' is a common sense solution to the problem that allows for flexibility depending upon what the attacker is doing , it is right that this should be decided in the courts on a case by case basis rather than the government trying to work out a set of laws to determine what constitutes self-defense and what does not .
Argumentative	 even if a right to self-defense was not recognized it would still be taken into account at trial .
Argumentative	 juries are asked , when viewing a trial , to consider what a `` reasonable man '' would do in a given situation .
Argumentative	 most jurors will surely acknowledge the right to self-defense in light of a threat to oneself , to one 's loved ones , and to one 's property .
Argumentative	 even if the state were to officially invalidate self-defense , juries and citizens would still consider it as a mitigating , or entirely absolving circumstance1 .
