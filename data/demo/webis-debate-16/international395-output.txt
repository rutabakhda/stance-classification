Non-Argumentative	during one of the democratic primary debates leading up thepresidential election, then senator barack obama was asked whether he would meet with the leaders of iran, syria, venezuela, and cuba, without preconditions.
Non-Argumentative	 obama said that “i would.
Non-Argumentative	 and the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this [the bush] administration – is ridiculous.”
Non-Argumentative	 his response drew criticisms from foreign policy commentators and political opponents, with hillary clinton deeming his response “irresponsible and naïve.”
Non-Argumentative	 others, however, hailed it as the advent of a new foreign policy of engagement, in stark contrast to what they saw as the diplomatic failure of the bush years.
Non-Argumentative	 although president obama has yet to sit down with any of the aforementioned leaders, he did reiterate his willingness to do so after he took office.
Non-Argumentative	 should president obama pursue this approach in his relations with “rogue nations”, or should preconditions be essential in earning them a spot at the negotiating table?
Non-Argumentative	 with iran allegedly developing nuclear weapons, syria in turmoil, and nuclear north korea experiencing a change in leadership, the answer to these questions is of the utmost importance for us foreign policy.
Argumentative	 from its early days , the obama administration has strived to change the tide of us foreign policy , by moving away from america 's unilateralism and dismissiveness of other nations .
Argumentative	 its treatment of its foes is a product of that same attitude .
Argumentative	 the general policy not to meet or negotiate without preconditions is akin to dangling a spot at the table like some sort of prize that foreign leaders need to work for .
Argumentative	 in international law , all states are sovereign and equal with no one having a right to interfere with other 's internal affairs .
Argumentative	 this means that all leaders should treat each other with respect and deference .
Argumentative	 no government is monolithic .
Argumentative	 in every regime there will be moderate forces willing to use diplomacy and negotiations and extremist elements that do not .
Argumentative	 by demanding that preconditions be fulfilled before a meeting , all power is given to the extremists .
Argumentative	 israel-palestine is an example of this .
Argumentative	 by often demanding that violence cease before negotiations can take place , the us and israel give a veto over negotiations to hamas , who are the perpetrators of violence .
Argumentative	 they get to decide if and when negotiations take place .
Argumentative	 instead , the president of the united states should always try to engage and strengthen moderates within these regimes .
Argumentative	 no country is likely to agree to conditions that will significantly reduce its bargaining power once it gets to the table .
Argumentative	 it would be diplomatically foolish to agree to preconditions that would essentially be the subject of the negotiations and the reason why the negotiations were needed in the fist place .
Argumentative	 if north korea agreed to freeze development of its nuclear arsenal , or if iran agreed to stop its nuclear enrichment programme , once the meeting between the two leaders took place , the position from which they started negotiating would be significantly weaker than the us 's .
Argumentative	 if , in order to meet with his counterpart , a ` rogue leader ' needs to compromise on his and his country 's position even before he gets to the table , this would be a signal of weakness to his opponents at home and those vying for his job .
Argumentative	 for example , in north korea , which is going through a dynastic transition , the new leader kim jong un is yet to become established and consolidate his status as dictator .
Argumentative	 any concession to the sate 's designated mortal enemy , the us , might jeopardise the succession .
Argumentative	 similarly , in iran where ahmadinejad has fallen from the graces of the supreme religious leader , the ayatollah , agreeing to preconditions in order to get a meeting with obama would signal to the iranian president 's rivals that it may be a good moment to attempt to force a change of guard .
Argumentative	 preconditions delay engagement and negotiations .
Argumentative	 sometimes it can take years before the parties even start talking to each other .
Argumentative	 in that time , iran will continue to enrich uranium and north korea will continue to expand its nuclear arsenal .
Argumentative	 if the us waits for preconditions to be agreed on and met , by the time president obama gets to talk and negotiate directly with the leaders of these states , he will have a much bigger crisis to deal with .
Argumentative	 it may have even gotten to the point where diplomacy can no longer be used effectively .
