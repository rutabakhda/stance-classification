Argumentative	 - alexander cavellblasphemy can not be shielded by the rationale which is used to defend freedom of speech .
Argumentative	 blasphemy constitutes an attack on the religion it is targeted at .
Argumentative	 beyond its ability to shock and offend , blasphemy exposes religious believers to ridicule , and perpetuates lies and falsehoods about their faith .
Argumentative	 moreover , blasphemy also drives conflict and exclusion within particular faiths , deepening schismatic divisions and encouraging believers to become more hostile to those who do not share their religion .
Argumentative	 blasphemy occupies a distinctly different position in public debate and discussion than civil , respectful discourse about religion .
Argumentative	 the forms of blasphemy law that were maintained in the legal systems of western liberal democracies throughout the twentieth century criminalised only the most extreme and intentionally provocative forms of religious expression -- images of religious figures involved in humiliating or sexualised scenarios ; statements about a religion that amounted to hate speech ; and words that were intended to mislead and deceive the naïve , credulous or doubting .
Argumentative	 the english blasphemy case of r v boulter drew on the conclusions of the sixth report of the commissioners on criminal law , which had observed that a criminal charge could only arise when `` irreligion '' took the form of an `` insult to god and man '' .

Argumentative	 ruling in the case of whitehouse v lemon , heard in, a senior english judge remarked that blasphemous libel , although thought to have fallen into disuse and irrelevance remained useful in safeguarding `` the internal tranquillity of the kingdom . ''
Argumentative	 this principle appears to be an antecedent to the public order justification for hate speech legislation -- speech that spurs people to commit violent or disruptive acts should be curtailed to protect public safety .
Argumentative	 that case restated the idea that `` it is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the christian religion , or to deny the existence of god , if the publication is couched in decent in temperate language . ''
Argumentative	 this is the sense in which the proposition side will discuss the term `` blasphemous '' .
Argumentative	 the proposition side does not intend to limit free speech , but has every intention of ensuring that free speech is not undermined or delegitimised by allowing the unobstructed broadcasting of hateful and provocative statements .
Argumentative	 we protect freedom of speech in our society not as a good in and of itself , but because through debate of even the most improbable propositions , socially valuable ideas may emerge and concerns that might otherwise be hidden can be expressed .
Argumentative	 by contrast , language aimed solely at offense has no redeeming value and does not contribute to any wider exchange of ideas and concerns .
Argumentative	 blasphemy does not appeal to reason , and by being directly exclusionary and offensive , it limits that ability of believers and non-believers to engage in structured debate .
Argumentative	 laws combating discrimination - such as the blasphemy law that the proposition side are advocating - promote social cohesion and stability , both important policy objectives in increasingly mobile and cosmopolitan societies .
Argumentative	 the united nations general assembly inargued `` defamation of religions is among the causes of social disharmony and leads to violations of human rights . ''

Argumentative	 the offensive content of the cartoons gave credence and legitimacy to sects and clerics espousing absolutist ideas that have no space for compromise or understanding .
Argumentative	 further , the protests also brought individuals who would ordinarily have considered themselves moderates into contact with violent extremists .
Argumentative	 neither of these outcomes does anything to promote a culture of free and frank discussion within the societies affected .
Argumentative	 the legal measures that side proposition supports do not oblige free thinkers to remain silent in the face of zealotry and bigotry .
Argumentative	 however , they does require writers , journalists and artists to apply their reason and their sense to content that they want to publish for mass consumption .
Argumentative	 much like laws that prevent the negligent operation of businesses , anti-blasphemy laws would set a minimal standard of responsible conduct in order to ensure that publications did not cause a dangerous level of offense to significant numbers ordinary and rational religious believers .
Argumentative	 legal definitions and enforcement of standards of responsibility do not preclude individuals from pursuing dangerous or entrepreneurial business ventures or public works .
Argumentative	 they need not prevent the creation of controversial and challenging forms of free expression either .
