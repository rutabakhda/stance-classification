Non-Argumentative	in most common law countries any common assault (that is deliberate or reckless physical contact without consent) is illegal.
Non-Argumentative	 there are however a series of exceptions to that proposition where the public interest is deemed to justify allowing such assaults.
Non-Argumentative	 for example, we allow people to cause others physical harm in the name of self defence or legal war and we allow the police to cause criminals a degree of physical harm.
Non-Argumentative	 in all these cases physical harm is allowed either because there is no alternative or because of the urgency of the situation.
Non-Argumentative	 they may also be justified by claims that these actions are in the name of the greater good.
Non-Argumentative	another oft used example is that of 'lawful chastisement.'
Non-Argumentative	 in most cases it is legitimate to strike children for that purpose where it would not be acceptable to strike an adult.
Non-Argumentative	 that is, the use of physical punishment to chastise one's spouse or employee has long been deemed illegal harassment in almost all nations, particularly democracies.
Non-Argumentative	 when milder physical punished is used to chastise children it is usually referred to as smacking or spanking.
Non-Argumentative	 the law varies from country to country as to what is an acceptable level of force but very few countries (germany and sweden are notable exception) have an outright ban on parents using such force.
Non-Argumentative	 "currently in england and wales, sectionof the children actenables parents to justify common assault of their children as "reasonable punishment", but prevents the defence being used in relation to more serious assault charges".
Non-Argumentative	 in order for a punishment to be 'reasonable' it must not cause serious mental or physical damage, it must be administered only by a parent and it must be in the name of punishment – rather than say sexual pleasure or as an emotional outlet.
Non-Argumentative	 the debate turns not only on the moral principle behind the legitimacy of smacking itself but also on the effects of allowing smacking on the state’s ability to police child abuse.
Argumentative	 children should receive the same legal protection from violence as adults .
Argumentative	 it is wrong that parents can deliberately inflict pain to the extent that if inflicted on an adult it would justify prosecution .
Argumentative	 in a number of countries , including the united kingdom , children are the most vulnerable members of society , yet the only group which can be legally assaulted .
Argumentative	 the council of europe -- which monitors compliance with the european convention on human rights -- ruled inthat smacking violated children 's rights against cruel and degrading treatment1 .
Argumentative	 furthermore , as time reports , a hundred years ago ` it was considered a novel idea for the law to say you could n't hit your wife .
Argumentative	 today ... children are the only class that is unprotected '.
Argumentative	 this is not right , ` children ... need more protection and not less '.
Argumentative	 it is time to right this wrong .
Argumentative	 the existing mechanisms to catch abusive parents are entrenched in most societies ; child abuse claims are often the result of third-party observers , often teachers , calling the police or child services .
Argumentative	 such a system would be expected to play a greater role in societies with a ban on smacking -- initial penalties would be financial only , to ensure that parents are taken away from their children only if they have proven themselves repeat offenders .
Argumentative	 this charge would only be if the child is underyears of age .
Argumentative	 parents who feel that smacking is an appropriate tool of discipline ` have to give up the privilege to physically discipline their children for the sake of protecting children that are n't being hit once in a blue moon or in a light way , but are really being hit day after day , many times a day '.
Argumentative	 only an outright ban on smacking will enhance child protection .
Argumentative	 the number of children reporting being beaten to the point of bruising in germany has declined fromintoinsinceafter a ban was introduced in germany .
Argumentative	 a culture that tolerates smacking makes it easier to conceal graver abuse .
Argumentative	 frequently , incidents of abuse reported by children are not investigated , or the cases abandoned as the abuse is written off as a case of `` legitimate punishment '' .
Argumentative	 a total ban enables child protection workers to give the parents of children at risk of abuse a clear message that no level of corporal punishment is acceptable .
Argumentative	 a parent who still continues to smack their child would no longer be able to hide behind the defence of `` reasonable chastisement '' .
Argumentative	 in european countries with a longstanding smacking ban , there has been an increase in the early detection of children at risk , and a decrease in the proportion of parents who are subsequently prosecuted .
Argumentative	 smacking , however occasional , is harmful to children .
Argumentative	 as well as causing physical pain there are lasting psychological effects .
Argumentative	 it is widely recognised that smacking undermines children 's confidence , weakens their emotional relationships and encourages the use of violence to resolve disputes with siblings and classmates .
Argumentative	 the experience of childhood smacking has even been linked with an increased risk of alcoholism , depression , masochistic fantasy and suicidal ideation in adult life .
Argumentative	 professor murray straus tested the iqs of children , spanked and not spanked , and found that the iqs of kids who were not spanked stayed the same over a four year period whilst the spanked toddlers dropped up topoints1 .
Argumentative	 the un convention on the rights of the child requires the countries to protect children from `` all forms of physical and mental violence '' .
Argumentative	 the committee on the rights of the child , its international monitoring body for the convention , emphasises that even physical punishment within the family is not compatible with full implementation , and has formally recommended prohibition to the uk and other countries .
Argumentative	 inthe european court of human rights found that the beating by a father of his stepson constituted `` inhuman or degrading punishment '' .
Argumentative	 the law in britain and other countries that tolerate smacking should be brought into line with european law to ensure the respect of basic human rights .
Argumentative	 smacking is harmful to society as normative forms of violence spill over into criminal forms .
Argumentative	 as corporal punishment is a significant factor in the development of violent behaviour in childhood and later life , an outright ban would help measures to reduce violence and crime .
Argumentative	 banning smacking would also help to promote the concept of zero tolerance of violence between all family members and thus reduce all forms of domestic violence , as well as reducing bullying between children .
Argumentative	 as sir al aynsley-green , children 's commissioner in england , has noted , ` we continue to send out confusing messages to parents about the acceptable use of violence across society1 .
Argumentative	 a strong , consistent message needs to be applied , starting with a total ban of smacking .
