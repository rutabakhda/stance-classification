Non-Argumentative	major league baseball (mlb), often referred to as “america’s pastime,” is unlike some other sports because it largely disallowing the use of instant replay to determine whether an umpire’s call was correct.
Non-Argumentative	  unlike american football—which allows videos of any play to be reviewed and, potentially, for officials’ calls to be reversed—baseball uses instant replay only for “boundary calls” involving potential home runs (in questions of whether a struck ball was a home run or a foul, or in situations where it’s unclear whether a fan interfered with a potential home run).
Non-Argumentative	  though the decision to adopt this limited degree of instant replay was a watershed in baseball history, many are calling for the sport to embrace instant replay more thoroughly by permitting it in a wider variety of situations.
Non-Argumentative	  it has been reported that mlb officials are considering this expansion for the coming season.
Non-Argumentative	though the push for instant replay has existed for years and seems to grow stronger whenever there is a high-profile mistake by an umpire, it reached unprecedented intensity after a notorious blown call in june 2010.
Non-Argumentative	  detroit tigers pitcher armando galarraga was one out away from a perfect game—among the rarest and most revered accomplishments in baseball—against the cleveland indians when the umpire incorrectly ruled a runner safe at first base.
Non-Argumentative	  video footage showed beyond any doubt that the umpire blew the call and that galarraga had been wrongly deprived of a place in baseball history.
Non-Argumentative	instant replay advocates differ in how they believe the sport should adopt the practice—for example, whether it should be limited to certain types of plays, or whether there should be a time limit.
Non-Argumentative	  though these are important questions, many arguments in this debate do not hinge on the specific mechanics of the instant replay used.
Argumentative	 the main goal of an umpire is to make accurate calls .
Argumentative	 umpires are meant to ensure that a player who is out is called out , for example , and that a foul ball is ruled a foul ball .
Argumentative	 when an umpire makes an incorrect call , he is falling short of fulfilling his primary responsibility .
Argumentative	 as the official rules of major league baseball instruct umpires , `` the first requisite is to get decisions correctly ... umpire dignity is important but never as important as ` being right ''' , official baseball rules , rule 9.05 .
Argumentative	 without a doubt , instant replay helps to improve the accuracy of calls .
Argumentative	 when a play can be reviewed after the fact , in slow-motion , from multiple angles , it 's almost inevitable that the result will be a more accurate judgment .
Argumentative	 instant replay serves as an additional tool for umpires , allowing closer examination of events .
Argumentative	 by providing umpires with an extra set of eyes , video cameras will better enable umps to fulfil their purpose .
Argumentative	 umpires must make split-second judgments , often from bad angles and with many elements to watch simultaneously .
Argumentative	 mistakes will happen .
Argumentative	 even the official rules acknowledge this when it tells umpires , `` you no doubt are going to make mistakes '' , official baseball rules , rule 9.05 .
Argumentative	 some calls will have to be made from a significant distance away from where the umpire is located -- a commonly cited justification of mlb 's adoption of instant replay on boundary calls .
Argumentative	 fans hold umpires to an exceptionally high standard ; as former umpire nestor chylak put it , `` they expect an umpire to be perfect on opening day and to improve as the season goes on . ''
Argumentative	 but it is impossible for a human to attain perfection on his own , so we should provide him with the tools that will enable him to meet the exacting standards set out for him .
Argumentative	 it is folly to withhold technology that is already available .
Argumentative	 even mlb commissioner bud selig , generally an opponent of instant replay , acknowledged `` that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis '' when he announced its adoption on boundary calls .
Argumentative	 just as we would never countenance a rule prohibiting umpires from wearing eyeglasses to see calls better , we should also not tolerate a rule that essentially keeps umpires blind to a reality that everyone else -- reporters , coaches , and fans -- has access to .
Argumentative	 well-respected sports illustrate columnist joe posnanski captured this point well : `` baseball ... should institute replay because it 's just not sustainable in today 's technological world to make bad calls on the field .
Argumentative	 those days are over ... you ca n't keep giving the fans at home better access to the truth than the home plate umpire . ''
Argumentative	 instant replay is a necessary tool to help umpires `` see '' better .
Argumentative	 instant replay will lead fans , managers , and players to hold umpires in higher regard .
Argumentative	 this will occur in two ways .
Argumentative	 first , the vast majority of umpires ' calls are accurate .
Argumentative	 statistical analyses have shown that well overpercent of calls are accurate , but this is not always appreciated by spectators .
Argumentative	 instant replay will often confirm umpires ' calls , which will call to the public 's attention just how often umpires get it right .
Argumentative	 second , in cases where umpires ' incorrect judgments could have very bad consequences -- for example , in the case of armando galarraga 's ruined perfect game , or in deciding the outcome of a crucial game -- instant replay will allow a reversal .
Argumentative	 this will spare the umpire much guilt and shame .
Argumentative	 umpire tim mcclelland , who was involved in questionable calls during theplayoffs , said as much about his experience and those of jim joyce , the umpire who blew galarraga 's perfect game : `` after watching what i went through in the playoffs last year and then what jim 's going through , i think more and more umpires are coming around to , increased use of replay . ''
Argumentative	 former umpire don denkinger expressed a similar sentiment .
Argumentative	 he blew a call in gameof theworld series , and probably changed the outcome of the entire season .
Argumentative	 `` i hadgreat years ... and i had one call that 's all anybody ever wants to talk about .
Argumentative	 it 's not right , '' he said , adding that he now supports instant replay .
Argumentative	 umpires are supposed to facilitate a smooth game .
Argumentative	 when they are the center of attention , it is usually because something has gone wrong .
Argumentative	 legendary hall of fame umpire bill klem accurately stated , `` the best umpired game is the game in which the fans can not recall the umpires who worked it . ''
Argumentative	 the game is supposed to be decided by the feats of the players on the field , not the fallibility of the men in blue .
Argumentative	 instant replay will help make this happen .
Argumentative	 with instant replay , we would not have had jim joyce , the umpire who blew galarraga 's perfect game , holding a tearful press conference apologizing for his missed call .
Argumentative	 instead , we would have had images of galarraga celebrating his historical achievement with his teammates .
Argumentative	 the latter , not the former , is what baseball is supposed to be about , and what fans want to see .
Argumentative	 instant replay will ensure that baseball revolves around the players , rather than the officials .
Argumentative	 there are times when umpires make incorrect calls that determine the outcomes of games or , worse , world series championships , e.g. , don denkinger and theworld series , mentioned above .
Argumentative	 these erroneous decisions lead to the team that deserved to win actually losing , and vice versa .
Argumentative	 in short , the results of the games are illegitimate .
Argumentative	 this is especially unfortunate when fans invest hours to watch a game , or hundreds of hours watching an entire season , only to see the wrong outcome -- which could have been entirely avoidable if umpires were allowed to review their decision .
