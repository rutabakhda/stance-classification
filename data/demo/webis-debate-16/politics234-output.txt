Non-Argumentative	the european parliament is a directly elected body that covers all european union members.
Non-Argumentative	 it hasmembers who are elected once every five years.
Non-Argumentative	 unusually for a parliament the system for the election of meps is not uniform across the union because this, within guidelines such as all using proportional representation, is left up to the member states to decide.
Non-Argumentative	 the biggest difference is that some countries have the whole country as one large constituency, such as germany or austria, while others split themselves into constituencies each with several mep’s, ireland for example has four constituencies with three meps representing each.
Non-Argumentative	 but there are many smaller differences too; some countries vote for individuals and others for party lists, some require a gender balance, some use electronic voting, and even the day on which voting takes place is not uniform.
Non-Argumentative	 of greater importance for the voter there are large differences in the number of citizens who are represented by each mep; from theelections germany will havemeps and maltasince germany has a population ofmillion against malta’s 400,000 it has one for every 854,000 inhabitants against malta’s one mep per 66,000.
Non-Argumentative	elections for the european parliament historically have low turnouts and it has been declining; inturnout was 61.99% but this had fallen to 43% in 2009.
Non-Argumentative	 as the legitimacy of a parliament is based on a democratic mandate low turnouts damage the legitimacy of the european parliament.
Non-Argumentative	 it is therefore right to explore possible ways of raising the turnout, both in terms of the number of registered electors voting and in terms of the total electorate.
Non-Argumentative	 the main response from the parliament is to provide better information about what it does to voters and how it affects voters’ lives; something that is made possible by the increasing powers the parliament has.
Non-Argumentative	 however the european parliament could think bigger and as such there have been calls for the eu to lower the voting age toin order to increase turnout as well as “improve intergenerational dialogue” and allow “young europeans… to have rights matching their duties”.
Argumentative	   it is ridiculous and clearly unfair that some sixteen year olds should get to vote in an election while most are barred from participating .
Argumentative	 this is the case in european parliament elections at the moment ; young people in austria are able to vote in elections atwhile everyone else has to wait until they are eighteen .
Argumentative	 this means that a tiny minority of the youth in the european union get to vote before the rest something which is clearly discrimination against the majority of the european union 'sandyear olds ; ` universal suffrage ' should be universal for the european parliament across the whole of the union .
Argumentative	 the age should therefore be lowered to sixteen so that voting age is universally recognised with no one group receiving the right to vote before the others .
Argumentative	 the number of different elections can be confusing ; almost everyone has three , european , national , and local , and some have others added in such as mayoral , or regional elections .
Argumentative	 as such there is much to be gained from helping to differentiate elections by not being concerned about being allowed to vote for them all at the same age .
Argumentative	 having elections for the european parliament at the age ofwould clearly distinguish the elections from all the other elections within the country , with the exception of austria .
Argumentative	 for the european union this would be an opportunity to show that it cares for the youth vote and has their issues at heart as it is a chance to get teenagers involved in europe before they can be involved in their own national elections .
Argumentative	 for the teenagers it provides a chance to engage with one election , and one electoral system , before all the others helping to keep things simple .
Argumentative	 young people are not well represented in european national parliaments either in terms of the membership of those parliaments or the policies they produce .
Argumentative	 the average age in the bundestag isand it is similar in most parliaments .
Argumentative	 youth unemployment in europe for the fourth quarter ofwas 23.2 % , almost twice the unemployment rate as a whole .
Argumentative	 this is because many countries do not implement youth friendly policies ; northern countries like germany are determined to impose austerity which increases unemployment , while southern countries when implementing reforms are not implementing labour reforms that would loosen the security of permanent workers in return for reducing unemployment .
Argumentative	 this may in part be a result of demographics in europe .
Argumentative	 europe is aging ; in19.3 % of the eu's population was underwhile 13.9 % over, bythis had changed to 15.6 % underand 17.5 % over.
Argumentative	 with an increasing contingent of elderly , who are anyway more likely to vote , the influence of young voters is declining .
Argumentative	 reducing the voting age will help to redress this imbalance .
Argumentative	 there would be clear advantages in having elections while young people are still in school as school could help prepare them for the elections .
Argumentative	 schools would be able to teach their students in advance what the ballot is like , about the process of voting , and most importantly about the european union and the function of the european parliament .
Argumentative	 one of the biggest problems with the european parliament is that voters do n't understand what it does .
Argumentative	 to take a couple of basics from a eurobarometer poll in,% of european citizens did not know meps were directly elected and% did not know that they sit in the parliament according to ideology not nationality .
Argumentative	 this shows how necessary education about the european parliament is .
Argumentative	 having elections atprovides an ideal opportunity as it means that most will participate in a european election while they are at school .
Argumentative	 teaching about why voting matters would also help to improve turnout .
Argumentative	 when austria reduced its voting age toit was found that turnout from 16-17 year olds was significantly higher than turnout for 18-19 year olds when both groups are first time voters .
Argumentative	 this suggests thatmay simply be the wrong time to introduce people to voting for the first time .
Argumentative	 since voting or not voting tends to be habit forming lowering the voting age could slowly increase turnout across the board .
Argumentative	 throughout the european union in the parliament elections there is a problem with protest voting .
Argumentative	 indeed studies have found that almost% of votes in european parliament elections are protest votes ; this is clearly bad for the european parliament as these are not the parties that the electorate really want when it comes to creating policy .
Argumentative	 it reflects the fact that voters do n't believe that their vote for the european parliament matters .
Argumentative	 yet because voting atis two years earlier than voting in most national elections voting for the european parliament will beandyear olds first experience of voting ; as they did not vote for the government they are much less likely to be using their vote simply as a protest against the national government .
Argumentative	 this is because it will be clear that they are not voting on the basis of national issues because they ca n't vote at that level .
Argumentative	 this then represents a good chance for parties to get their european policies across to the youngest voters so that they know what their vote at the european level means .
