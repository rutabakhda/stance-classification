Non-Argumentative	the us guantanamo bay detention facility in cuba is operated by the joint task force guantanamo of the american armed force with the primary purpose of acting as a detention facility for "terrorist suspects" captured in the us war on terror, particularly in afghanistan and iraq.
Non-Argumentative	 it holds approximatelyinmates defined under the bush administration as "enemy combatants".
Non-Argumentative	 following years of  legitimacy of the detention facility and the legal rights of detainees, president barack obama announced onjanuarythat he was suspending all ongoing military tribunals, and that the detention facility would be shut down within the year.
Non-Argumentative	 this action has renewed  pros and cons of the detention facility, and whether or not a similar detention facility and/or legal apparatus should replace the facility elsewhere.
Non-Argumentative	 on the one hand of the debate, supporters of the camp claim that it is a necessary evil that acts not only to deter terrorist activities, but also to disrupt the coordination of their various splinter groups.
Non-Argumentative	 on the other hand, the camps effectiveness may not justify the numerous breaches of human rights and the violations of international law that have been claimed against it.
Non-Argumentative	 questions over whether the detainees can bring forward a writ of habeas corpus to force a hearing on their state are also intrinsic to the debate.
Argumentative	 additional questions include whether the detention of foreign nationals, on the basis that they are a threat to america, is sufficient justification for guantanamo’s permanent presence.
Argumentative	prisoners have been detained at guantanamo for long periods without clear charges being filed and without trial .
Argumentative	 this is a violation of the international legal principle of habeas corpus .
Argumentative	 one of the primary problems is that , without clear charges and a presentation of evidence against a suspect , the suspect can not contest the charges and prove their own innocence .
Argumentative	 and , as a matter of fact , numerous detainees have been found innocent , but only after excessively long periods without being charged or brought before a court .
Argumentative	 many guantanamo detainees may have never committed terrorist acts or fought against us forces in afghanistan at all ; they were simply turned over by northern alliance and pakistani warlords for bounties of up to $ 25,000 .
Argumentative	 for almost seven years they have been held without a fair hearing or opportunity to demonstrate those facts .
Argumentative	 courts who reviewed the cases ofdetainees to see if there was reasonable evidence for their continued detention found no credible basis for detainingof them .
Argumentative	 other detainees were captured in places where , at the time of their arrest , there was no armed conflict involving us forces .
Argumentative	 the case of the six men of algerian origin detained in bosnia and herzegovina in octoberis a well-known and well-documented example .
Argumentative	 therefore the only way to resolve these issues is to try all the detainees at guantanamo bay in us courts , and release any against whom charges can not be brought .
Argumentative	 former us secretary of defense colin powell has endorsed this reasoning , arguing that `` i would get rid of guantanamo and the military commission system and use established procedures in federal law ... , it 's a more equitable way , and more understandable in constitutional terms , '' us courts are fully capable of dealing with terrorist trials , as shown by the fact that they have renderedconvictions in terror-related cases in the past .
Argumentative	 convictions in us courts would probably be seen internationally as having more legitimacy than those obtained through the current system of military tribunals , which is often viewed as rigged against the defendants .
Argumentative	 only by allowing full due process in american courts can the rights of the detainees be uaranteed and their guilt or innocence truly established .
Argumentative	 the existence of guantanamo bay is cited by terrorists as a tool of `` the great satan '' and is seen by muslims in general as a demonstration of us disregard for their dignity .
Argumentative	 it is , in turn , an effective tool used by terrorists and jihadists to bring recruits on-board .
Argumentative	 the highly unpopular existence of guantanamo bay also makes it more risky for intelligence sources to come out and provide useful information that they might otherwise be willing to provide .
Argumentative	 this is because , for many muslims , guantánamo stands as a confirmation of the low regard in which they believe the united states holds them .
Argumentative	 some of this stems from the association of detention at guantanamo with the specifically anti-islamic abuses which have reportedly occurred there , such as allegations of having a guard dog carry the koran in its mouth , guards scrawling obscenities inside korans , kicking korans across the floor , urinating on the koran , ridiculing the koran , walking on the koran , and tearing off the cover and throwing the koran into trash or dirty water .
Argumentative	 these associations not only make it easier for terrorists to recruit by inciting anti-american sentiments , but also harm the us ' ability to argue that the war on terror is not directed against all muslims .
Argumentative	 president obama announced inthat closing the guantanamo bay detention centre would allow the us to reclaim the moral high ground and thus better prosecute the war on terror . ''

Argumentative	 , un reports indicate that the treatment of detainees since their arrests , and the conditions of their confinement , have had profound effects on the mental health of many of them .
Argumentative	 the treatment and conditions include the capture and transfer of detainees to an undisclosed overseas location , sensory deprivation and other abusive treatment during transfer ; detention in cages without proper sanitation and exposure to extreme temperatures ; minimal exercise and hygiene ; systematic use of coercive interrogation techniques ; long periods of solitary confinement ; cultural and religious harassment ; denial of or severely delayed communication with family ; and the uncertainty generated by the indeterminate nature of confinement and denial of access to independent tribunals .
Argumentative	 these conditions have led in some instances to serious mental illness , overacts of self-harm inalone , individual and mass suicide attempts and widespread , prolonged hunger strikes .
Argumentative	 the severe mental health consequences are likely to be long term in many cases , creating health burdens on detainees and their families for years to come .
Argumentative	 such conditions are clearly not acceptable to a nation such as the us which prides itself on its justice system and respect for human rights .
Argumentative	 the detention centre must be closed to the us can end its association with such practices .
