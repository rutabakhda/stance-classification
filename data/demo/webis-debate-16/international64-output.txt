Non-Argumentative	the democratic republic of the congo (drc) is one of the poorest and most war torn countries in the world.
Non-Argumentative	 yet it is also a country with immense natural wealth, not least of which is the great congo river itself.
Non-Argumentative	 the congo river is a river of superlatives, one of the biggest in the world it is 4700km long with a drainage basin of 4million km2 and a discharge of 41,000 m3/sec.
Non-Argumentative	 the congo river is also unique in having rapids in its lower course.
Non-Argumentative	 these rapids for centuries made the interior of the region impenetrable to outsiders now they provide an opportunity for hydroelectric power which relies upon being able to use water and gravity to drive turbines and create electricity.
Non-Argumentative	 the congo at inga dropsmeters over 14.5km of waterfalls and rapids.
Non-Argumentative	there are already two dams at the inga falls and a third on the way.
Non-Argumentative	 inga i and ii were constructed during the rule of dictator mobutu along with the inga-shaba high voltage power lines completed in 1982.
Non-Argumentative	 these grand projects brought zaire (as it was then called) deeply into debt despite the power being meant to allow investment in natural resources.
Non-Argumentative	 inga iii is currently under construction and will produce 4,800 mw of electricity without much disruption to the river as the river won’t be closed off and no tunnels built.
Non-Argumentative	 inga iii might be said to be stage i of the grand inga dam even though it will be able to operate independently.
Non-Argumentative	the biggest project is the proposed $50 billion grand inga dam which would generate up to 40,000mw.
Non-Argumentative	 it is a ‘run-of-river’ project in which water is siphoned off the main flow of the river before going through turbines to get back into the main channel.
Non-Argumentative	 in the case of the grand inga this means flooding side valleys at a bend in the river.
Non-Argumentative	 the advantage is that the main course of the river is left unaltered.
Non-Argumentative	 despite this it is clearly an immense project that will provoke opposition from environmental activists and questions about the drc’s ability to manage such a project.
Argumentative	 only% of sub saharan africa 's population has access to electricity .
Argumentative	 this has immense consequences not just for the economy as production and investment is constrained but also on society .
Argumentative	 the world bank says lack of electricity affects human rights `` people can not access modern hospital services without electricity , or feel relief from sweltering heat .
Argumentative	 food can not be refrigerated and businesses can not function .
Argumentative	 children can not go to school ... the list of deprivation goes on . ''
Argumentative	 conveniently it is suggested that the `` grand inga will thus provide more than half of the continent with renewable energy at a low price , '' providing electricity to half a billion people so eliminating much of this electricity gap .
Argumentative	 the grand inga dam would be an immense boost to the drc 's economy .
Argumentative	 it would mean a huge amount of investment coming into the country as almost all the $billion construction cost would be coming from outside the country which would mean thousands of workers employed and spending money in the drc as well as boosting local suppliers .
Argumentative	 once the project is complete the dam will provide cheap electricity so making industry more competitive and providing electricity to homes .
Argumentative	 even the initial stages through inga iii are expected to provide electricity for 25,000 households in kinshasa .
Argumentative	 dr congo has been one of the most war ravaged countries in the world over the last two decades .
Argumentative	 the grand inga provides a project that can potentially benefit everyone in the country by providing cheap electricity and an economic boost .
Argumentative	 it will also provide large export earnings ; to take an comparatively local example ethiopia earns $ 1.5 million per month exporting 60mw to djibouti atcents per kwh comparable to prices in south africa so if congo were to be exportingtimes that , at 30,000 mw only 3/4ths of the capacity , it would be earning $ 9billion per year .
Argumentative	 this then will provide more money to invest and to ameliorate problems .
Argumentative	 the project can therefore be a project for the nation to rally around helping create and keep stability after the surrender of the rebel group m23 in october.
Argumentative	 while the congo is mostly navigable it is only usable internally .
Argumentative	 the rapids cut the middle congo off from the sea .
Argumentative	 the building of the dams could be combined with canalisation and locks to enable international goods to be easily transported to and from the interior .
Argumentative	 this would help integrate central africa economically into the global economy making the region much more attractive for investment .
