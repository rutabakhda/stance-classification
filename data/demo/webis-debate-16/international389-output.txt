Non-Argumentative	federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen.
Non-Argumentative	 it is distinct both from systems of government where all executive authority rests with a single institution (unitary government) and also from those systems where the decisions at the highest level of government can affect only the state’s interactions with other states and not the functions of lower levels of government or its citizens (confederal government).
Non-Argumentative	federal systems of government are characterised by two principles - the idea of subsidiarity, which relates to the distribution of powers between the different levels of government, and democracy, which relates to the way in which decisions are taken at any given level.
Non-Argumentative	in the context of federalism, subsidiarity is invoked as the reason for allocating decisions to one level of government rather than another.
Non-Argumentative	 it is usually defined as insisting that political power should be as decentralised as possible, and only centralised if necessary.
Non-Argumentative	 democracy is achieved as each level of government will have its own political relationship with the citizen.
Non-Argumentative	 its politicians will hold office because they have won elections specifically for that purpose, rather than because they have been nominated by a different level of government instead.
Non-Argumentative	 a federal legislature will be composed of directly elected mps rather than mps nominated by the parliaments of its member states.
Non-Argumentative	a federal system therefore has to have a constitution to set out the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and to guarantee their practical and political independence in exercising them.
Non-Argumentative	 the core problem, however, with creating a federal system of governance within europe is the sovereignity issue – countries will lose their original power and absolute control over their territories and population.
Non-Argumentative	 developed countries such as the western european powers do not want to grant such control to only one government, which is going to decide the fate of the entire continent.
Non-Argumentative	federalism implies a strong degree of subsidiarity, with power devolved to the lowest appropriate level, rather than a very centralised state (such as france or britain were before reforms in the 1990s).
Non-Argumentative	 this implies that the current states within the eu, while losing overall independence, would retain considerable powers over issues such as culture, education, law and order, infrastructure, and the taxation and justice systems required to support these, as the states within the u.s.a do today.
Non-Argumentative	 devotees of subsidiarity would, however, also wish national governments to devolve other existing powers downwards to their regions and local authorities, further weakening the role of today’s national politicians within a future federal europe.
Argumentative	 a federal europe would build upon the success of the eu and its predecessors in taming the nationalism that caused so much conflict in the twentieth century .
Argumentative	 the eu is drawing nearer to realising the vision of its founders for an `` ever-closer union '' .
Argumentative	 despite the eu 's relative success in this regard , while national governments still exist they will regard policy-making within europe as a competitive business , abusing vetoes and damaging the potential prosperity of all of europe 's citizens .
Argumentative	 such is the case with britain 's veto over the carbon tax , which the eu wants to implement - `` the british government is `` highly likely '' to block european commission proposals for a carbon tax contained in a widely-circulated draft version of the energy taxation directive , eu diplomatic sources said yesterday '' .
Argumentative	 a federal european state can build on the shared history and culture of its members to further the common good , while accommodating regional differences .
Argumentative	 a federal europe will be more advantageous for individual citizens , since they will be living in a powerful state , yet with respect of their cultural and local situation subsidiarity combines maximum effectiveness with maximum accountability , with decisions being made at the lowest appropriate level .
Argumentative	 citizens gain the advantages of living in a large , powerful state in terms of international economic , military and political power , all available more cheaply in a state ofmillion people , and through their increased opportunities for work , study , etc, yet the advantages of living in a smaller state are preserved in terms of connection to the political process , respect for local cultural traditions and responsiveness to differing economic and physical situations .
Argumentative	 such checks and balances prevent tyranny and increase willing obedience to laws .
Argumentative	 overall , we now have something resembling parliamentary democracy at the european level .
Argumentative	 eu political institutions now look more like those of a member state than they do those of an international organisation .
Argumentative	 the challenge facing the european union in the future is to fill the gap between itself and the citizen , providing a political connection equal to the social , cultural and sporting connections that the single market has already provided .
Argumentative	 federalism and subsidiarity can allow for regional identities in a way national states can not -- e.g. for northern ireland , corsica , basque region , lombardy .
Argumentative	 in a federal europe such peoples would not feel under threat from a dominant culture and long-running conflicts could be resolved , as issues of sovereignty become less relevant within the new political structures .
Argumentative	 a federal europe will be better equipped to promote the interests of its citizens in the world , carrying more influence in the un , wto , imf and other intergovernmental and treaty organisations than its individual states do now .
Argumentative	 furthermore , europe has a lot to contribute to the world in terms of its liberal traditions and political culture , providing both a partner and a necessary balance to the usa in global affairs .
Argumentative	 once unified , europe will become an , even more , important negotiating and trading partner -- one of the biggest economies in the world .
Argumentative	 it will have a population ofmillion -- more than the united states and russia combined .
Argumentative	 it will be the world 's biggest trader and generate one quarter of global wealth .
Argumentative	 it presently gives more aid to poor countries than any other donor .
Argumentative	 its currency , the euro , comes second only to the us dollar in international financial markets .
Argumentative	 france , germany , poland - these countries can hardly ever negotiate something with giants such as the us or china .
Argumentative	 europe as one country stands a better chance of putting its message across effectively .
Argumentative	 the success of federal states elsewhere in providing peace and prosperity for their citizens , alongside democratic safeguards , point to the advantages of pursuing this model in europe .
Argumentative	 the usa , australia and canada provide standards of living for their citizens which most europeans would envy , while federal india is the best example of a long-term democratic success in the developing world .
Argumentative	 the application of the principles of federalism to the european social and environmental policy s the key to european success .
Argumentative	 the creation of the single market meant that much national regulation of social and environmental issues ceased to be effective : only a european approach at the same level as the regulation of business would be able to work .
Argumentative	 otherwise , companies might simply transfer from one member state with a great deal of regulation in these areas to another member state with less .
Argumentative	 if what economists call `` externalities '' were not to go unaddressed altogether , european social and environmental policies became necessary .
Argumentative	 therefore only federal unity can bring eu states closer together in order for them to work as successfully as others federal countries .
Argumentative	 in a globalised economy , there is a need to tame multinational corporations , which would be otherwise capable of playing national governments off against each other in search for low wages , social costs and state protection .
Argumentative	 a federal europe would be powerful enough to demand high standards of behaviour from such companies , because only a powerful and economically significant player can dictate restricting conditions .
Argumentative	 this would ensure fair wages , safe working conditions and - additionally - europe would be able to force the multinational companies to implement correct and holistic policies and would also be in a position to make a greater difference on environmental issues such as global warming .
Argumentative	 sovereignty becomes less relevant when effective independence is lost anyway as the economy and the problems faced by all nations are increasingly globalised .
Argumentative	 federalism and subsidiarity , that things should be dealt with at the lowest , most local , level possible , can allow for regional identities in a way national states can not .
Argumentative	 for example for northern ireland , corsica , basque region , lombardy .
Argumentative	 in a federal europe such peoples would not feel under threat from a dominant culture and long-running conflicts could be resolved , as issues of sovereignty become less relevant within the new political structures .
