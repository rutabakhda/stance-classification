Non-Argumentative	at least as far back as ben johnson's steroid scandal at theolympics, the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports had entered the public psyche.
Non-Argumentative	 johnson's world record sprint, his win, and then, the stripping of his gold medal made news around the world.
Non-Argumentative	 however, performance-enhancing drugs in sports do not begin with johnson.
Non-Argumentative	  a quick overview of drugs in sports reveals the earlier use of questionable substances; some even argue that drugs in sports date back to the earliest olympic games.
Non-Argumentative	an alarming number of sports today, baseball, football, track and field, and especially cycling, have been shaken by doping scandals in recent years.
Non-Argumentative	 several olympic champions were stripped of their medals as a result of positive drugs tests.
Non-Argumentative	 although attention is often focused upon athletics, almost all sports have a “drug problem” and devote considerable energy to testing competitors regularly, banning those who fail them.
Non-Argumentative	 an anonymous survey conducted by the u.s. anti-doping agency revealed that about one tenth of all athletes admit to having used drugs, even though illegal (2).
Non-Argumentative	 nonetheless, doubts remain as to the effectiveness of these tests and the fairness of some of the resulting bans, and some argue the whole approach is deeply flawed.performance-enhancing drugs include steroids (the male hormone testosterone), human-growth hormone (hgh), recombinant erythropoietin (r-epo), an artificial hormone and other drugs taken to build muscle-bulk during training, and stimulants or blood-doping taken to improve performance in competition.
Non-Argumentative	 authorities tend to deal with this problem in different ways, for example, for the tour de france cycling competition all sportsmen were deemed suspicious and ranked on a list fromto(1), others impose random tests on athletes.
Non-Argumentative	 the market for performance enhancing drugs, such as epo (erythropoietin) is big, inalone, epo--generated more than $5 billion for inventor amgen (2).
Non-Argumentative	 question is what is the appropriate measure to deal with performance enhancing drugs – is there a way to control them and is there any sense in controlling them at all.
Non-Argumentative	most such drugs have some medical uses and are prescribed legally in certain non-athletic contexts; it is unlikely that a proposition would also wish to legalize “recreational” drugs such as cocaine, heroin and amphetamines, although all of these could be regarded as performance-enhancing in certain sporting contexts.
Argumentative	 freedom of choice : if athletes wish to take drugs in search of improved performances , let them do so .
Argumentative	 they harm nobody but themselves and should be treated as adults , capable of making rational decisions upon the basis of widely-available information .
Argumentative	 even if there are adverse health effects in the long-term , this is also true of tobacco , alcohol and boxing , which remain legal .
Argumentative	 we allow world class athletes to train forhours a week , on average , adjust their diets and endanger themselves by pushing the boundaries of their body .
Argumentative	 we let them do it , because it is what they chose which is best for them .
Argumentative	 according to the nfl player association the average life expectancy of an nfl player isyears of age  .
Argumentative	 thus already we allow athletes to endanger their lives , give them the choice of a lifestyle .
Argumentative	 why not also extend this moral precedent to drugs ?
Argumentative	 the natural/unnatural distinction is untenable .
Argumentative	 already athletes use all sorts of dietary supplements , exercises , equipment , clothing , training regimes , medical treatments , etc. to enhance their performance .
Argumentative	 there is nothing ` natural ' about taking vitamin pills , wearing whole-body lycra suits , having surgery on ligaments , spending every day in a gym pumping weights or running in shoes with spikes on the bottom .
Argumentative	 diet , medicine , technology , and even just coaching already give an artificial advantage to those athletes who can afford the best of all these aids .
Argumentative	 since there is no clear way to distinguish from legitimate and illegitimate artificial aids to performance , they should all be allowed .
Argumentative	 so taking these drugs is no more unnatural than what happens today .
Argumentative	 a practical example of an unnatural aid is the speedo worn inat the beijing olympics .
Argumentative	 fina , the world governing body of swimming was concerned about the extraordinary statistics in beijing where swimmers wearing the speedo lzr racer swimsuit wonper cent of all available medals and brokeworld records .
Argumentative	 since speedo launched the suit in,world records have fallen , until february.
Argumentative	 the use of performance enhancing drugs is based on advances in science .
Argumentative	 when new drugs and therapies are found , athletes turn to them and as a result are much of the time ahead of the anti-doping organizations , which need to develop methods of athlete testing whenever a new drug that is meant to be untraceable is created .
Argumentative	 init was a big shock when riccardo ricco , a cyclist , was caught using the performance-enhancing drug mircera , which had been considered undetectable for a number of years .
Argumentative	 the fact is that a ban of performance enhancing drugs enables mainly athletes from wealthy countries and teams that can afford the newest technology to go undetected , whilst others are disadvantaged  .
Argumentative	 so because it gives an unfair advantage to the wealthy one who can pay for the undetectable drugs , we should legalize it .
Argumentative	 it does not take a lot for chemists to produce performance enhancing drugs , the scientific american reports : `` rogue scientists start with testosterone or its commercially available analogues and then make minor structural modifications to yield similarly active derivatives . ''
Argumentative	 the underground chemists make no effort to test their creations for effectiveness or safety , of course .
Argumentative	 production of a simple new steroid compound would require `` lab equipment costing maybe $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 , '' .
Argumentative	 depending on the number of chemical reactions needed for synthesis , `` some of them could be made in a week or two .
Argumentative	 others might take six months to a year . ''
Argumentative	  as a result of legalizing performance-enhancing drugs a backstreet industry can become regulated as a result there will be much more control and testing to ensure the health and safety of the athletes who take the drugs .
