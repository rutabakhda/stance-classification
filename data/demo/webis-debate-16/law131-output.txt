Non-Argumentative	in his book the death of punishment, robert blecker proposes that prison conditions should vary, based on the offences that a person is convicted of; those who have committed more heinous crimes should have harsher prison conditions.
Non-Argumentative	 currently prison sentences are calibrated to fit the crime by their length, rather than their conditions.
Non-Argumentative	blecker supports the death penalty for the worst of the worst, but if this is unavailable wishes a separate prison system for them.
Non-Argumentative	 the system proposed by blecker is a “permanent punitive situation” in which prision would deliberately be make “painful and unpleasant” for those whose crimes are heinous enough that they are “specially condemned by a jury to suffer this fate”, essentially for those who today in the united states would receive the death penalty.
Non-Argumentative	the regime under pps would include the sole food being nutraloaf (euphemistically referred to as “special management meal” by some), a foodstuff made to be tasteless and used as a disciplinary measure: the compatibility of punishing inmates by altering their food intake with the us constitution has been disputed.
Non-Argumentative	 “we should keep their visits to the constitutional minimum, and none would be contact visits, ever… they would labor daily, and exercise.
Non-Argumentative	 but they would not be allowed to play.”
Non-Argumentative	 it goes without saying they would have no access to computers or the tv.
Non-Argumentative	 blecker proposes placing photographs of the victim of the offence the prisoner was convicted of in their cell, restricting visits the absolute minimum, minimizing showers to once per week, the constitutional minimum exercise and no association with other prisoners.
Non-Argumentative	  blecker singles out for criticism the system of the us where he argues that counterintuitively the worst prisoners get the best treatment in prison.
Non-Argumentative	 an action that draws blecker’s ire in particular is the sight of prisoners serving life without parole (lwop) playing baseball (note that while lwop is, in theory, the second highest sentence after the death penalty, over 3,000 people in the us are serving lwop for nonviolent drug and property offences.
Non-Argumentative	 blecker would have such offenses in normal prisons).
Non-Argumentative	 the problem, in part, is that those who are in prison longest are most able to obtain privileges for good behaviour.
Non-Argumentative	 even worse is death row as “they have it better than everybody else in the prison” to the point that blecker quotes a lifer saying “i’d be better off killing an officer.
Non-Argumentative	 get better privileges if they moved me to the row.”
Non-Argumentative	 this is because the wardens “want to make the time as easy for them as we can because it makes it easy for us if it is easy for them.”
Non-Argumentative	in england and wales, male prisoners are divided in to a number of categories based on factors including the type of crime, duration of sentence, escape risk and potential danger in escape.
Non-Argumentative	 categories a, b and c are closed prison categories, category d is for those held in open prisons.
Non-Argumentative	 category a prisoners are subdivided in to further categories based on escape risk.
Non-Argumentative	 remand prisoners (those who have not been convicted of anything and await trial, but bail has been denied) are generally given some privileges that those convicted don’t have (for example, in general, wearing their own clothes).
Non-Argumentative	 this is not always the case in the us.
Argumentative	 retributive theories of justice accept that the reason why a criminal justice exists is to punish offenders -- society declaring its rejection of crime by inflicting deliberately unpleasant punishments .
Argumentative	 prisons do not reflect this -- a prisoner is a prisoner , and prison officers generally do not care about what offence they are convicted of .
Argumentative	 their motivation for doing this being to make the prison easier to administrate .
Argumentative	 `` the past counts '' .
Argumentative	 if we are making prisoners stay in prison we should make them feel as if they are being punished .
Argumentative	 this means deprivation of more than just the liberty to move from the prison but also of other luxuries .
Argumentative	 differences between different categories of prisoner are already accepted in the criminal justice system -- prisoners are generally kept in different conditions due to factors such as escape risk and other factors .
Argumentative	 for example the uk has open prisons which offer the freedom to move around within the prison and the system is aimed at reintegration so freedoms like alcohol are allowed , as are home visits .
Argumentative	 once it is accepted that not all prisons and not all prisoners are treated the same then a difference in treatment based on the crime committed makes sense .
Argumentative	 if that is the case , it could be calibrated that those serving certain sentences for certain offences should be held in certain conditions -- for example , in connecticut , a state that has abolished the death penalty so lwop is the greatest penalty imposed , those serving life without parole are now denied contact visits and are given no more than two hours of recreation per day .
Argumentative	 worse prison conditions for particular offences would act as a deterrent .
Argumentative	 if people , in prisons generally and in society as a whole , see that those who are convicted of particularly bad crimes will be deterred from committing those worse crimes .
Argumentative	 if prison is simply a holding place that prevents people inside from committing crime then it is failing in creating deterrence ; criminals sometimes feel it is better to commit a crime when released in order to get back into prison .
Argumentative	 katz , levitt , and shustorovich using death rates show how harsh prison conditions are likely to mean lower crime rates overall -- though a doubling of the death rate only reduces the crime rate by a few percentage points .
