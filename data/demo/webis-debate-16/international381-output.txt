Non-Argumentative	located high in the himalayan mountains, tibet is one of the most isolated places in the world.
Non-Argumentative	 yet while it is geographically and culturally distinct, it has a long history of interaction with its neighbours.
Non-Argumentative	 an aggressive series of tibetan rulers built a large empire during the 9th century ad, repeatedly invading china, and while tibet submitted to the mongols, it was never quite conquered.
Non-Argumentative	tibet managed to remain largely independent of both the various chinese and indian dynasties untilwhen the qing dynasty sent a resident commissioner.
Non-Argumentative	 his power varied – fromuntil the late 19th century he wielded significant control over the court of the dalai llama, but the llama remained nominally absolute, and chinese influence collapsed prior to therevolution.
Non-Argumentative	tibet’s autonomy came to an abrupt end inwhen chinese troops invaded.
Non-Argumentative	 for the next nine years the dalai llama ruled in uneasy cooperation with the chinese government before fleeing to india in 1959.
Non-Argumentative	 since that time china has pursued an aggressive campaign of secularization and modernization which on one hand has resulted in a large rise in living standards and the abolition of feudalism, but on the other in repression of tibetan culture and the forced importation of han settlers.
Non-Argumentative	there are two main aspects to the question of tibet’s future.
Non-Argumentative	 first there are questions of how china has governed tibet.
Non-Argumentative	 has china failed to govern tibet in an appropriate manner, or has it done a pretty good job?
Non-Argumentative	 has it violated human rights in tibet?
Non-Argumentative	 was its exiling of the dalai lama inappropriate?
Non-Argumentative	 is it illegitimate for china to govern tibet while depriving it of its spiritual and historical leader?
Non-Argumentative	 does this constitute a suppression of its religious freedoms?
Non-Argumentative	 how bad are china's human rights violations in tibet relative to human rights violations elsewhere in the world where separatist movements exist?
Non-Argumentative	 is it really all that bad or are we just being hyper-sensitive to tibet due to the public exposure of the dalai lama and the tibetan case?
Non-Argumentative	 has china stonewalled tibet on negotiations, or has it been politically reconciliatory?
Non-Argumentative	 has china economically exploited tibet or helped invest in and modernize it economy?
Non-Argumentative	 conversely, have tibetans followed ethical and human rights norms in tibet, or have they engaged in the same kind of abuses as the chinese government?
Non-Argumentative	 have tibetans killed and/or abused chinese settlers in tibet?
Non-Argumentative	 have tibetan protests been peaceful and respectful, or have they been unethical and/or violent?
Non-Argumentative	 has the behavior of tibetan exiles been appropriate, or have they been violent and revolutionary?
Non-Argumentative	 should a tibetan right to self-determination survive any alleged tibetan human rights abuses?
Non-Argumentative	 does tibet have a history of human right abuses?
Non-Argumentative	 what effect does this have on tibet's bid for independence?
Non-Argumentative	secondly there are the more moral questions of legitimacy.
Non-Argumentative	 namely, whether the chinese seizure of tibet was legitimate, and whether that should have any bearing on the present.
Non-Argumentative	finally there are the questions of whether tibet would be a viable independent state.
Non-Argumentative	 would it be able to resist chinese influence?
Non-Argumentative	 would it only be able to do so with excessive western aid?
Non-Argumentative	 would the latter justify chinese fears about dismemberment?
Non-Argumentative	 what would happen to the han settlers who make up almost half the population?
Argumentative	 tibet has a long history of independence going back more thanyears .
Argumentative	 even in times of chinese `` domination '' , tibetans largely governed themselves independently of the small number of chinese officials in lhasa .
Argumentative	 tibet at most was a tributary of china , and was no more part of it than thailand , myanmar or korea .
Argumentative	 and fromuntilit was entirely independent and conducted its foreign relations as such , for example remaining neutral in world war ii despite both its neighbours the republic of china and the british empire being on the side of the allies .
Argumentative	 tibet 's annexation by china occurred under the guns of 40,000 chinese soldiers , and the precedent begun by the invasion stands as one of the few post-1945 cases in which the national principle was abandoned and the only one in which a fully independent state vanished from the map .
Argumentative	 when one notes that tibetans have their own language , and a history that includes far more wars with the chinese than examples of kinship , chinese arguments of sovereignty have little bearing on the reality .
Argumentative	 due to systematic campaign of sinocization , millions of han chinese have been encouraged to settle in tibet , and with the support of the government they now dominate the economy and upper echelons of the administration .
Argumentative	 demographically tibetans are rapidly becoming a minority within their own country , and administratively this has already taken place .
Argumentative	 while short of open genocide , the intent of the chinese government is quite clearly the elimination of the tibetan people as a distinct national , cultural and linguistic group .
Argumentative	 not only are they attempting to drown them through settlement , but tibetan students are forced to learn mandarin in the schools and are being taught that they are chinese .
Argumentative	 while there may well have been past periods of chinese sovereignty , the policies of the current beijing government seem designed to produce an outcome far more permanent than those past efforts which respected tibetan identity and culture .
Argumentative	 an independent tibet would serve a useful purpose as a neutral and demilitarized buffer state between india and china .
Argumentative	 given the rising economic and military clout of both powers , a future conflict is becoming ever more likely , and they already fought one war against one another in.
Argumentative	 an independent tibet would mean that the two nations would no longer have a common border , making their rivalry less practical and far less pressing .
Argumentative	 this would reduce military obligations for both , and prevent the tibetans from being caught in the middle of a future conflict .
Argumentative	 tibet , and the resistance tibetans continue to show to chinese rule presents a toxic domestic and international political problem that costs far more than it worth .
Argumentative	 domestically , violence in tibet is the most serious domestic disturbance facing the chinese government , and the fact that there is nearly constant violence between han settlers and tibetans forces the chinese to alienate everyone in order to contain it .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the economic and political disenfranchisement of the tibetan people is an enormous domestic problem , as it has led to large numbers becoming unemployed and moving to other parts of china where they form an underclass .
Argumentative	 internationally , the tibetan issue keeps china 's human rights record in the news and almost torpedoed theolympic games .
Argumentative	 given that china is already losing money on the province , it may well be worth it for china to jettison it in order to gain much greater international benefits .
