Non-Argumentative	the internet and social networks have come to be the core weapon in the arsenal of dissidents when they engage in uprising against oppressive or illiberal regimes.
Non-Argumentative	 by use of social networks and other social media like twitter, these activists have been able to coordinate broad action and to communicate their message and the spirit of dissent through populations.
Non-Argumentative	 this was the case during the arab spring, where social media were vital in the overthrow of regimes in egypt and tunisia, with activists and protesters using these tools to spread information and organize.
Argumentative	Â by enacting this subsidy , the west makes a tacit public statement in favour of those involved in uprisings without coming out and publicly taking a side .
Argumentative	 this is a shrewd position to take as it blunts many of the fall-backs opposed regimes rely upon , such as blaming western provocateurs for instigating the uprising .
Argumentative	 rather than making a judgment call involving force or sanction , the simple provision of anonymity means the people involved in the uprisings can do it themselves while knowing they have some protections to fall back on that the west alone could provide .
Argumentative	 this is a purely enabling policy , giving activists on the group access to the freedom of information and expression , which aids not only in their aim to free themselves from tyranny , but also abets the west 's efforts to portray itself publicly as a proponent of justice for all , not just those it happens to favour as a geopolitical ally .
Argumentative	 in essence , the policy is a public statement of support for the ideas behind uprisings absent the specific taking of sides in a particular conflict .
Argumentative	 it throws some advantages to those seeking to rise up without undermining their cause through overbearing western intervention .
Argumentative	 and that statement is a valuable one for western states to make , because democracies tend to be more stable , more able to grow economically and socially in the long term , and are more amenable to trade and discourse with the west .
Argumentative	 by enacting this policy the west can succeed in this geopolitical aim without making the risers seem to be western pawns .
