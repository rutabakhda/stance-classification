Non-Argumentative	theottawa convention banned the use and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines.
Non-Argumentative	 one hundred and thirty-three nations have signed the convention – the usa has not although inthe obama administration announced a review of us policy that might lead to it signing up to the ottawa convention.
Non-Argumentative	 the convention's aims became official united nations policy with general assembly resolution 53/77.
Non-Argumentative	 the ottawa convention requires those that do so to abandon the use of landmines within ten years, and also requires the destruction of the signatory's stockpile of landmines.
Non-Argumentative	the main reason the us gives for its refusal to sign the ottawa convention is that it feels there should be a unique exception for the landmines in the korean demilitarized zone to recognise the military necessity of preventing movement across that border.
Argumentative	 landmines are a terrible and immoral tool of war .
Argumentative	 america should neither practise nor condone this kind of warfare .
Argumentative	 unlike other weaponry , landmines remain hidden in the ground long after conflicts have ended , killing and maiming civilians in some of the world 's poorest countries years , even decades later .
Argumentative	 in afghanistan% of victims are children .
Argumentative	 even if other weaponry has similar effects , it does n't mean landmines are acceptable -- it means they are bad , too .
Argumentative	 but we must start somewhere -- we can make a difference by capitalising on the global movement against landmines , and we should .
Argumentative	 the usefulness of landmines is significantly over-represented .
Argumentative	 they are easily removed by quite low-technology military equipment -- which means that they are not very dangerous to armed forces whose mobility is not significantly restricted , this is after-all the purpose of the mines , but are incredibly harmful to civilians .
Argumentative	 a significant problem is that many minefields have been left unmarked and that they can remain active for more thanyears .
Argumentative	 removing a landmine can be fairly easy , but detecting them is not .
Argumentative	 landmines provide a false sense of security .
Argumentative	 they are often purchased and placed by nations that are fearful of their surrounding neighbours , rather than entering into diplomatic arena to improve relations .
Argumentative	 they are the symbol of exactly the wrong approach to international affairs .
Argumentative	 small , underdeveloped countries should channel their efforts into improving their economies -- they should not be encouraged , or frightened by scaremongering , by the usa into buying the usa 's military equipment .
Argumentative	 it is absurd to suggest that landmines are the prime protector of us forces , or even an important one .
Argumentative	 it is well known that the principal benefit the usa 's troops , as opposed to those of other nations , have in peacekeeping is the threat of the deployment of overwhelming force if they are defied .
Argumentative	 landmines are nothing to do with it .
Argumentative	 us troops have not been pinned down in the way the opposition suggests since world war two , except in iraq : and there , as elsewhere , the damage done to relations with the civilian community would far outweigh any narrow military benefit garnered from landmine deployment .
Argumentative	 indeed the use of landmines by the us has slowly been changing , sincethe us has only allowed the use of landmines with deactivation mechanisms however it has not actually used landmines in more thanyears .
