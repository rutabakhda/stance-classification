Non-Argumentative	some modern states grant politicians outright immunity from prosecution.
Non-Argumentative	  in such countries, including albania, brazil and to a lesser degree france, politicians may not be subjected to criminal prosecution while they hold office.
Non-Argumentative	  other nations, such as the united states, have mechanisms of de facto immunity for politicians, by granting the head of the executive the uncontrolled power to issue pardons, effectively making any member of their cabinet immune.
Non-Argumentative	  many other nations give no such protections to the holders of political office, beyond protection from civil claims for remarks made while in parliament.
Non-Argumentative	the resolution is that politicians be granted a full and inviolate immunity from prosecution while serving.
Argumentative	  the premier reason that most states , even those that allow for the prosecution of politicians , abstain from prosecuting them while they hold office is that being a politician is a job that requires one 's undivided attention .
Argumentative	 especially for the holders of prominent national-level offices , writing legislation , responding to crises under one 's purview , consulting one 's constituents , and engaging in campaign work often lead to politicians working an upwards ofhour day , every day .
Argumentative	 to expect politicians cope with all of these concerns will simultaneously constructing a defense against pending charges would be to abandon all hope of them serving their constituents effectively .
Argumentative	 we are rightly aggravated when politicians take extensive vacations or other extracurricular forays .
Argumentative	 being under indictment not only consumes even more of a politician 's time ; the stress it causes will inevitably seep into what remaining time they do allocating to fulfilling their duties , further hindering their performance .
Argumentative	 the impeachment proceedings for bill clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice were so intensive that they took tremendous resources away from not only the president himself , but all branches of the federal government for several months , amidst serious domestic and foreign policy concerns such as the ongoing war in kosovo .
Argumentative	 by the most popular definition , a state is the entity with the monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a defined territory .
Argumentative	 politicians , as the government of that state , necessarily wield the institutions of that state force .
Argumentative	 this results in the tremendous responsibility of deciding when the overwhelming power of the state is exercised .
Argumentative	 this pertains to a variety of areas , such as police action against civil unrest , the interrogation of both alleged and convicted terrorists , and economic policies that subsidize industries with state resources .
Argumentative	 while it is certainly possible to brazenly abuse this power , in many cases politicians are presented with options which are , if at all illegal , marginally so , and made with the good faith interest of the nation at heart .
Argumentative	 there are even conceivable situations in which a politician may exercise options that are clearly illegal but serve an overwhelming state interest ; consider an illegal raid on a private building in order to prevent a nuclear bomb from going off .
Argumentative	 while documented instances of policy-makers choosing not to act for a particular reason are rare , several senior cia officials stated that they had become risk averse merely because the idea of prosecuting officials who made security policy had entered the public discourse .
Argumentative	 we ought to place politicians in a situation where the only factor in their decision-making process is what serves the public interest , rather than having to weigh what they consider to be the right action against the chance it will lead to their incarceration .
Argumentative	 attempting to avoid this through a limited system which allowed for the prosecution of apolitical crimes but immunity for political decisions would fail to accomplish the goals of prosecution of politicians , which is primarily to protect against political abuses of state power which threaten the rights of the citizenry .
Argumentative	 the obvious benefit to prosecuting politicians is that it punishes -- and thereby deters -- corruption by politicians .
Argumentative	 however , this benefit can be achieved through other means .
Argumentative	 firstly , many western liberal democracies have one form or another of removing a politician from office in the midst of their term , such as impeachment in the american system or a vote of no confidence against the government in the westminster system .
Argumentative	 while defenders of immunity oppose impeachment as contrary to the principles outlined above , because of the effect that it may have on political duties , this is an option that remains in cases of gross misconduct .
Argumentative	 if the political will can not be mobilized to remove a sitting politician , they are held accountable by the electorate to whom they must answer in the next election , and who will likely punish blatant misuse of political power .
Argumentative	 even if the individual politician has reached a limit on their term of office , or does not seek reelection , they are still held in check by the damage that will be done to their party in the event of major misconduct on their part .
Argumentative	 finally , most politicians are significantly concerned about their legacy , which is tarnished significantly by corruption even if they are never held legally accountable for it .
Argumentative	 while nixon received a full pardon from his success , his name has become synonymous with criminality and scandal : a fate most politicians wish to avoid .
Argumentative	 it does tremendous damage to the public perception of a given political position to see the holder of that position on trial for criminal acts .
Argumentative	 politicians are important role models for the populace at large , and shining light on everyone one of their misdeeds is not conducive to them playing such a role .
Argumentative	 this hurts the ability of their successors who , though completely innocent , are stepping into an institution now tainted with the image of corruption or scandal .
Argumentative	 finally , the very process of prosecution can be damaging to the country , as citizens on opposing sides of the political spectrum disagree over the legitimacy of charges .
Argumentative	 these effects all deal real damage to the political institutions necessary for the functioning of the state .
Argumentative	 as noted above , the political life is steeped in difficult decisions , and some of these are bound to result in choices that are at least potentially illegal .
Argumentative	 the ability to prosecute politicians incentivizes political opponents to search out past actions by said politicians so as to immobilize them politically .
Argumentative	 such prosecutions are therefore not motivated by concern for justice , nor are they conducive to a well-functioning , multipartisan political system wherein representatives seek to work together to achieve their political ends .
Argumentative	 in the most extreme cases , powerful politicians use prosecutions to immobilize their political opponents .
