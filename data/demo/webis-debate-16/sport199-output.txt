Non-Argumentative	the united kingdom is generally seen as the birthplace of football (soccer) as the world currently knows it today.
Non-Argumentative	 the first formal set of rules were drawn up in the uk by the football association in 1863, the first official international game took place inbetween scotland and england in glasgow and the world's first football league was setup in england in 1888.
Non-Argumentative	 but despite being the birthplace of the sport the united kingdom does not currently field a football team in the olympic games.
Non-Argumentative	 every four years the debate rages as to whether the uk should field a team in the sport in which it created, however with theolympics being awarded to the united kingdom inthe debate has become much fiercer than usual.
Non-Argumentative	the core reason there has not been a uk olympic football team for overyears, despite it being the number one sport in the uk, is that the four countries which make up the united kingdom; england, scotland, wales and northern ireland, each have separate independent football bodies, footballing leagues as well as currently playing as separate footballing nations in the fifa world cup and uefa european cup competitions.
Argumentative	 so should the united kingdom form a combined team for the olympics or are the obstacles for this to happen too great?
Argumentative	due to the rules around olympic football in regards to qualifying , which make it impossible for the united kingdom to qualify , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for footballers of the uk to play olympic football .
Argumentative	 to enter the event there is a qualification round , in europe the uefa under-21 championship event is not only a stand-alone competition it is also used for olympic qualification1 ; as uk nations enter this competition as separate teams it means that the uk can not normally enter the olympic event as they would technically have four chances to qualify whereas each other country has only one .
Argumentative	 however , as the uk is the host nation of theolympics it gains automatic qualification for all the events at the games , including football , which it would usually be illegible to enter .
Argumentative	 the home nations should pull together and enter a unified team to the olympics as it is quite literally a once in a lifetime opportunity to have any team from the uk playing olympic football , to not enter a team despite having qualification is quite unheard of and as the uk is the home of football it would be a vast disappointment if the uk did not enter .
Argumentative	 the olympics is meant to represent the top of each sport and for the uk not to enter a team for what is the most popular sport in the country seems an odd state of affairs .
Argumentative	 one of the major barriers of the uk entering a team into the olympics has been gaining the permission of fifa , whose stance has traditionally been that the uk can not play as separate nations in fifa and uefa football tournaments and then come together for the olympics as one team , they must be either entirely together or entirely separate .
Argumentative	 however as theolympics are being held in london , fifa has officially sanctioned the creation of a one-off uk team for theolympics only .
Argumentative	 sepp blatter , the fifa president , has personally stated ' a british olympic football team would not affect at all the privileges of the four british associations as members of fifa '.
Argumentative	 the barriers of creating a uk team then are therefore lower than ever and it should be acted upon .
Argumentative	 the act of union demonstrated the nations of the uk can pull together , and for this one-off uk-based event the footballing associations should put their differences aside and seize this opportunity while the barriers to its creation remain historically low .
Argumentative	 if there is any attempt in the future to use this union as proof that the nations should permanently join , the independent football bodies would simply be able to point to or lean on fifa 's permission ; the explicit sanctioning of the uk team for londonis all the assurance necessary to compete without fear of repercussions .
Argumentative	 the olympic creed states that `` the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle .
Argumentative	 the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well .
Argumentative	 ``as the uk is the host nation of the olympics init should now , more than any other time really follow this creed and take part in all the events particularly as they have the opportunity to do so having got automatic qualification for all the events ; not doing so would be undermine the olympic ideal .
Argumentative	 a uk football team would be good for national unity .
Argumentative	 by giving allmillion people in great britain and northern ireland the same team to cheer for , it will make them feel more united .
Argumentative	 sincewales , scotland and northern ireland have been given a lot of political power over their own affairs .
Argumentative	 this is good but there is a danger that we lose sight of our common british identity and the government is keen to find ways of promoting britishness ,2 including a british football team .
