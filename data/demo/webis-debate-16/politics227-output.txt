Non-Argumentative	nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons ever developed.
Non-Argumentative	 the right to possess these weapons is an issue of serious contention in the international community.
Non-Argumentative	 non-proliferation treaties exist within the united nations, and between countries, such as between the united states and russia.
Non-Argumentative	 the most comprehensive, thenuclear non-proliferation treaty (npt), consists of a pledge by current nuclear weapon states to reduce their nuclear stockpiles and achieve nuclear disarmament in return for non-nuclear weapon states not developing such weapons.
Non-Argumentative	 while some countries and institutions are eager to see a reduction in nuclear weapon stockpiles, others are eagerly seeking to obtain them.
Non-Argumentative	 north korea recently developed their first functional nuclear weapon, and iran is often accused of attempting to develop their own.
Non-Argumentative	 such countries have met with international condemnation.
Non-Argumentative	 so far, despite the npt, those who were recognized as nuclear powers have not upheld there side of the bargain and disarmed.
Non-Argumentative	 this has led to the question of whether other countries should also have a right to nuclear armament.
Non-Argumentative	 those that are trying to prevent these regimes gaining nuclear weapons counter that despite slow progress the npt still applies.
Argumentative	 they are worried that weapons developed by less wealthy states are more likely to fall into the hands of terrorists, either through a lack of secure facilities or through being sold.
Argumentative	the nation-state is the fundamental building block of the international system , and is recognized as such in all international treaties and organizations .
Argumentative	 states are recognized as having the right to defend themselves , and this right must extend to the possession of nuclear deterrence .
Argumentative	 often states lack the capacity to defend themselves with conventional weapons .
Argumentative	 this is particularly true of poor and small states .
Argumentative	 even wealthy , small states are susceptible to foreign attack , since their wealth can not make up for their lack of manpower .
Argumentative	 with a nuclear deterrent , all states become equal in terms of ability to do harm to one another .
Argumentative	 if a large state attempts to intimidate , or even invade a smaller neighbour , it will be unable to effectively cow it , since the small state will have the power to grievously wound , or even destroy , the would-be invader with a few well-placed nuclear missiles .
Argumentative	 for example , the russian invasion of georgia inwould likely never have occurred , as russia would have thought twice when considering the potential loss of several of its cities it would need to exchange for a small piece of georgian territory .
Argumentative	 clearly , nuclear weapons serve in many ways to equalize states irrespective of size , allowing them to more effectively defend themselves .
Argumentative	 furthermore , countries will only use nuclear weapons in the vent of existential threat .
Argumentative	 this is why , for example , north korea has not used nuclear weapons ; for it , like all other states , survival is the order of the day , and using nuclear weapons aggressively would spell its certain destruction .
Argumentative	 countries will behave rationally with regard to the use of nuclear weapons , as they have done since their invention and initial proliferation .
Argumentative	 weapons in the hands of more people will thus not result in the greater risk of their use .
Argumentative	 the issues discussed in international forums are largely set by nuclear powers .
Argumentative	 the permanent membership of the united nations security council , for example , is composed only of nuclear powers , the same states that had nuclear weapons at the end of world war ii .
Argumentative	 if all countries possess nuclear weapons , they redress the imbalance with regard to international clout , at least to the extent to which military capacity shapes states ' interactions with each other .
Argumentative	 furthermore , the current world order is grossly unfair , based on the historical anachronism of the post-world war ii era .
Argumentative	 the nuclear powers , wanting to retain their position of dominance in the wake of the post-war chaos , sought to entrench their position , convincing smaller nations to sign up to non-proliferation agreements and trying to keep the nuclear club exclusive .
Argumentative	 it is only right , in terms of fairness that states not allow themselves the ability to possess certain arms while denying that right to others .
Argumentative	 likewise , it is unfair in that it denies states , particularly those incapable of building large conventional militaries , the ability to defend themselves , relegating them to an inferior status on the world stage .
Argumentative	 to finally level the international playing field and allow equal treatment to all members of the congress of nations , states must have the right to develop nuclear weapons .
Argumentative	 nuclear weapons create stability , described in the doctrine of mutually assured destruction , mad .
Argumentative	 countries with nuclear weapons have no incentive to engage in open military conflict with one another ; all recognize that they will suffer destruction if they choose the path of war .
Argumentative	 if countries have nuclear weapons , fighting simply becomes too costly .
Argumentative	 this serves to defuse conflicts , and reduce the likelihood of the outbreak of war .
Argumentative	 for example , the conflict between india and pakistan was defused by the acquisition of nuclear weapons by both sides .
Argumentative	 before they obtained nuclear weapons , they fought three wars that claimed millions of lives .
Argumentative	 relations between the two states , while still far from cordial , have never descended into open war .
Argumentative	 the defusing of the immediate tension of war , has given the chance for potential dialogue .
Argumentative	 a similar dynamic has been played out a number of times in the past , and as of yet there has never been a war between two nuclear powers .
Argumentative	 when states have nuclear weapons they can not fight , making the world a more peaceful place .
Argumentative	 when nuclear deterrence is an acknowledged right of states , they will necessarily be less concealing of their capability , as the deterrent effect works only because it is visible and widely known .
Argumentative	 knowledge of states ' nuclear capability allows greater regulation and cooperation in development of nuclear programs from developed countries with more advanced nuclear programs .
Argumentative	 developed countries can help construct and maintain the nuclear weapons of other countries , helping to guarantee the safety protocols of countries ' programs are suitably robust .
Argumentative	 this will cause a diminution in clandestine nuclear weapons programs , and will reduce the chances of weapons-grade material falling into the hands of terrorists .
Argumentative	 thus , greater openness and freedom in the development of nuclear weapons will increase the security of nuclear stockpiles .
