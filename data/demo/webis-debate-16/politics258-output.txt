Non-Argumentative	puerto rico, officially the commonwealth of puerto rico, is a self-governing unincorporated territory of the united states located in the north-eastern caribbean.
Non-Argumentative	 the united states conquered puerto rico from the spanish inwhen puerto rico became an unincorporated u.s. territory meaning it is controlled by the united states but only selected parts of the constitution apply.
Non-Argumentative	 many believe that puerto rico should move beyond its status as a territory to become a state within the united states of america.
Non-Argumentative	 while a majority of puerto ricans have voted for continued status as a territory, there are rising calls for statehood.
Non-Argumentative	 the main questions include whether it is important for puerto ricans to gain full rights as citizens, and whether statehood is a superior means to achieving this than independence.
Non-Argumentative	 others include whether puerto rico will gain economically from statehood (verses the status quo and independence).
Non-Argumentative	 socially and culturally, is puerto rico consistent with the characteristics that have defined other states entering the united states, such as alaska or hawaii?
Non-Argumentative	 will english be the primary language, or a co-official language along with spanish?
Non-Argumentative	 and this raises the question, is english the only possible official language possible in a us state - as english-only advocates would have it - or is it possible to have another language as an official language as well?
Non-Argumentative	 are there cultural concerns for puerto ricans who have a strong national identity?
Non-Argumentative	 finally, will democrats or republicans benefit more politically from puerto rican statehood?
Non-Argumentative	 is there a self-motivated bias coming from american politicians pushing for puerto rican statehood?
Non-Argumentative	although puerto rico voted in novemberto become a state this does not end the debate.
Non-Argumentative	 president obama has promised to respect the will of the islanders on the issue so removing one possible obstacle but there is still the us congress to negotiate.
Non-Argumentative	 congress only needs a simple majority in both houses but that may not be simple as republicans assume the new state would be democrat and currently control the house.
Non-Argumentative	 the referendum is also less clear than it might be as although 54% voted for change on a first question the option of statehood got less than 50% of all voters if those who voted on the first question but not on the second are counted.
Argumentative	Â currently , puerto ricans do not receive full political rights and equal representation , despite their american citizenship .
Argumentative	 although it has its own governor and legislature which handles some domestic matters , inhabitants of puerto rico receive no say in us federal matters or foreign policy , despite being heavily affected by them , more so than most current american states , as puerto rico sits in the caribbean surrounded by other island nation-states .
Argumentative	 if puerto rico became a us state , puerto ricans would then share as everyone else in full benefits from the us government , while paying taxes like everyone else .
Argumentative	 the status quo perpetuates a semi-colonial situation in puerto rico , where american citizenship , which they have held since, carries fewer rights than in the us proper .
Argumentative	 this has been the situation since the us captured puerto rico in, and no other us territory has been held in limbo like this for so long .
Argumentative	 during this time puerto ricans have supported the us by serving in large numbers , both voluntarily and through conscription , in the us military in every major war since the spanish-american war .
Argumentative	 however the island 's current status still prompts united nations to still debate whether puerto rico is a colony .
Argumentative	 us congressional inquest into puerto rico 's political situation has found that , despite the divergent views that puerto ricans have with respect to their preferred political status , `` all factions agree on the need to end the present undemocratic arrangement whereby puerto rico is subject to the laws of congress but can not vote in it . ''
Argumentative	 the former chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court , jose trias monge , has written a book on the political status of puerto rico entitled `` puerto rico : the trials of the oldest colony in the world . ''
Argumentative	 therein he argued that just prior to the u.s. invasion , the island enjoyed greater freedom and rights in certain areas than it does now , including an insular parliament that could legislate in matters of monetary policy , banking , import/export duties , and public credit ; the ability of puerto rico to negotiate its own commercial treaties ; puerto ricans were spanish citizens , equal in all respects to mainland spanish citizens ; the spanish constitution applied in puerto rico in the same manner as it applied in spain proper ; the autonomic charter of, which governed puerto rico 's relation with spain , could not be changed except with puerto rico 's consent .
Argumentative	 the political rights currently enjoyed by puerto ricans , such as their right to elect their own governor , are not even guaranteed to them in the status quo .
Argumentative	 in, the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice .
Argumentative	 to perpetuate this current second-class status is morally unacceptable in a nation which pledges itself to `` liberty and justice for all '' .
Argumentative	 american statehood would lead to significant economic growth for puerto rico .
Argumentative	 statehood would mean that the island would shed its ineffective and costly reliance on preferential tax credits and more fully integrate into the national economy .
Argumentative	 in a study by hexner , jenkins , lad and lame , `` puerto rican statehood : a precondition to sound economic growth , '' the case is persuasively made that statehood is necessary for the island 's economic growth .
Argumentative	 as an american state , the standard of living in puerto rico would profoundly improve for the average person .
Argumentative	 with average income going up , families would be able to pay their fair share of taxes while still improving their net income and standard of living .
Argumentative	 for those with low incomes , the u.s. citizens of puerto rico would have the same access to tax relief and federal support programs as any other citizen of the country , unlike under the present status where significant disparities exist .
Argumentative	 this is particularly significant as approximately% of puerto ricans live under the federal poverty line .
Argumentative	 many areas of us federal funding to puerto rico would actually improve .
Argumentative	 for example , the currentstates can receive up to% reimbursement through medicaid for critical health information technologies ; puerto rico is not eligible for these supplements .
Argumentative	 according tocongressional testimony by governor anibal acevedo-vila , had puerto rico been treated like the other states , it would have received $ 1.7 billion dollars in federal medicaid support instead of the $million received .
Argumentative	 translated to monthly amounts , federal medicaid support in the states approximated $per month per participant ; the amount in puerto rico was about $per month .
Argumentative	 the us is one of the richest countries on earth , and being a full part of it would give puerto ricans a lot of practical advantages that the independent countries of the spanish-speaking caribbean lack .
Argumentative	 the right to move to the us-proper and work there legally , for example , is extremely valuable .
Argumentative	 overall , therefore , there is a compelling economic case for puerto rico to seek american statehood .
Argumentative	 some have made the argument that puerto rico should not be a state because puerto ricans do not speak english , and that the us should not have a non-english speaking state .
Argumentative	 this argument does not hold up for the following reasons : english is already an official language on the island with the same status as spanish .
Argumentative	 puerto ricans are already citizens of the u.s. , and have been since1917 .
Argumentative	 there was no language requirement with the granting of citizenship then , so it makes no sense to ask this question now .
Argumentative	 in fact , there has never been a language requirement of territories entering the union in american history .
Argumentative	 english is a required subject in public schools through high school .
Argumentative	 english is the only language of the federal court system and all u.s. government agencies in puerto rico and is the common language in banking , commerce , real estate and the tourism industry .
Argumentative	 learning english as well as spanish just makes good sense .
Argumentative	 english is the international language of business , science , and increasingly , diplomacy .
Argumentative	 puerto rico should do all it can to increase english language capability .
Argumentative	 but , making it a requirement of statehood would ignore the precedents of enabling acts of louisiana , new mexico , oklahoma and arizona , all of which similarly had issues of large non-english speaking populations and gave or give these other languages some official status in law .
