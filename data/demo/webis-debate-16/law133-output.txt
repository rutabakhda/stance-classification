Non-Argumentative	ariel sharon, who was prime minister of israel fromto 2006, died on the 11th of january 2014, after eight years in a persistent vegetative state due to a massive stroke.
Non-Argumentative	 sharon, who held positions in israeli governance since 1981, was a highly important figure – but also a highly controversial one.
Non-Argumentative	 to his supporters, he has been described as the “architect of israel”, and a man who aimed to create a peaceful and sustainable israel.
Non-Argumentative	 to his opponents, he was a butcher and a war criminal.
Non-Argumentative	initially a member of the pre-independence paramilitary group haganah, which formed the core of the nascent idf when it was formed in 1948, he rose to the rank of major-general, taking part in theconflict (referred to as the war of independence by israelis and the al-nakba – the catastrophe – by the palestinians and others) which lead to the independence and recognition of the state of israel, the suez crisis, the six-day war inin which israel captured the sinai peninsula, gaza strip, west bank and golan heights, and theconflict known variously as the yom kippur war or the october war.
Non-Argumentative	 this included leadership of unit 101, created inunder orders by then prime minister david ben-gurion to carry out reprisal operations.
Non-Argumentative	 in october 1953, israeli troops under sharon’s control attacked qibya, a village in the west bank, in whichpeople, mostly women and children, were killed.
Non-Argumentative	 this was an act of retaliation following attacks from the west bank in which israelis were targeted: sharon wrote in his diary that he was ordered to make the attack “an example for everyone”.
Non-Argumentative	 these actions were condemned by the un security council.
Non-Argumentative	entering electoral politics inas a member of the israeli legislature, the knesset, for likud, he became the security adviser of pm yitzhak rabin, he had a spell betweenandas minister of defence, during which israel invaded lebanon in 1982, parts of which were occupied until 1985.
Non-Argumentative	during the conflict, kataeb, a lebanese christian militia, lead a massacre of civilians (betweenand 3,500) in the sabra area of beirut, the lebanese capital, and the nearby shalita refugee camp while the idf prevented those in the areas from leaving.
Non-Argumentative	 in addition to a un commission (and a general assembly vote deeming it an act of genocide), an israeli inquiry, the kahan commission, deemed sharon responsible.
Non-Argumentative	 he resigned as minister of defence, but remained in government, becoming foreign minister in 1999.
Non-Argumentative	 he was elected as prime minister in 2001, during his term creating a new party, kadima.
Non-Argumentative	 while prime minister, he lead a unilateral withdrawal of israeli settlers from the gaza strip.
Argumentative	 in addition to events mentioned in the introduction , sharon was accused of , along with troops under his command , execution-style killings ofegyptian civilians taken prisoner by the idf in the saini peninsula in- wilful killing of civilians being a war crime as per the fourth geneva convention .
Argumentative	 the purpose of international criminal law is that individuals are brought to trial to ensure that individuals are held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity : if a person is n't prosecuted , either by a domestic or international court , the credibility of the limits civilized nations place on war is eroded .
Argumentative	 an international mechanism where sharon would have been able to be tried would be likely to have been one which would have been able to hear cases dealing with the -- serious -- allegations of crimes against humanity and war crimes by various other groups such as the al-qassam brigades , the paramilitary group attached to hamas .
Argumentative	 this would have been able to prevent further atrocities by acting as a deterrent through punitive methods as well as showing that the law applies to western nations and their allies too .
Argumentative	 prosecutions by international criminal courts have a positive side-effect of creating a historical record of events .
Argumentative	 this creates an impartial record of events which takes in to account the evidence provided by all parties .
Argumentative	 by removing scope for denialism , a peace can be constructed on the foundations of an impartial truth .
Argumentative	 many of the actions of israel have been controversial , the guardian says it is the issue that is most controversial and comes under most scrutiny , such an impartial historical record would be particularly useful for a full understanding of atrocities committed by all sides .
Argumentative	 by prosecuting perpetrators , justice creates a deterrent .
Argumentative	 the deterrent effect , as accepted in criminal law generally , is likely to make the peace more long standing and stable in the future -- it will make those minded to perform atrocities think again .
Argumentative	 if those who committed atrocities ` get away with it ' they will be much more likely to plunge the country back into violence .
Argumentative	 if sharon was prosecuted for his crimes in the 50s , would he have gone on to have the same political career ?
Argumentative	 he would likely not have had the chance to allow the sabra and shatia massacre or operation defensive shield .
Argumentative	 the career of laurent nkunda is a good example of this ; he fought in the tutsi group that took control of rwanda inending the genocide and then was a rebel commander in both congolese civil wars in which he was accused of atrocities before launching his own rebellion , only now afteryears as an army commander is he under arrest .
Argumentative	 clearly nkunda being locked up at some stage would have been better than regularly negotiating with him to try and create peace .
