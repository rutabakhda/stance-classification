72| 2009 US economic stimulus|premise|"""Let’s review some of the more silly arguments about the stimulus bill, starting with the notion that 'only' 75 percent of the money can be spent in the next two years, and the rest is therefore 'wasted."
73| 2009 US economic stimulus|conclusion|Much stimulus rightly goes toward long-term societal needs.
73| 2009 US economic stimulus|premise|"""what's striking is that supposedly intelligent people are horrified at the thought that, during a deep recession, government might try to help the economy by buying up-to-date equipment for the people who protect us from epidemics and infectious diseases, by hiring people to repair environmental damage on federal lands and by contracting with private companies to make federal buildings more energy-efficient."

124| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|The 700 wall cannot be compared to the Berlin wall.
124| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|The wall is not trapping individuals inside an area as the Berlin Wall did, but ensuring the regulation of cross-border flows.
125| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|Building a border fence is not racism.
125| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|Protecting national sovereignty and controlling borders is not racism.
126| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|Illegal immigration is unfair to legal immigrants.
126| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|It is difficult for foreigners waiting in line to immigrate to the United States to observe illegal immigrants crossing freely.
127| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|Building a wall is not comparable to berlin's wall.
127| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|The Berlin wall was intended to keep people in, the US-Mexico wall would keep people out.
128| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|A 700 mile fence is like the Berlin Wall.

132| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|While the barrier might not cover the entire span of the border, it will cover one-third, channeling illegal immigrants to the remaining two-thirds of the border.
133| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|Past fences succeeded in deterring crossings over the particular sections of the border they covered.
133| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|Opponents of building the 700-mile wall often cite the fact that previous fences and policing operations in the 1990s that aimed to secure heavily crossed urban stretches of the border in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California did not substantially reduce the in-flow of illegal immigrants overall.

134| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|"""."
135| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|Many past fences have failed to stop illegal immigration only because they were meant to stop drug-trafficking.
135| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|The 700-mile fence would be designed with greater focus on stopping illegal immigrants and would likely be much more effective at doing so.

139| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|Many opponents of a fence point out that it would leave over 1000 miles of border without any fencing, and that it is not directly tied to needed comprehensive immigration reform.
140| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|The difficulty of securing the border should not prevent the US from trying with a fence.
140| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|Just because the 700-mile fence will be difficult to build, will encounter problems, and will not be 100% effective, does not mean that it should not be built.

149| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|The roads required for building a border fence may actually aid illegal immigration.
149| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|Roads need to be built to enable the construction of a border barrier.
150| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|A 700 mile fence will help secure the southern US border against a number of threats.
150| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|"""The increased smuggling of drugs, humans and who-knows-what-else through a burgeoning international trade route through Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Laredo, Texas, is unsettling."
151| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|Border fences do not decrease smuggling.

156| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|The roughly $2 billion price tag of the fence is not particularly high.
157| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|A 700-mile fence will reduce long-term border security costs.
157| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|A border fence will reduce the costs of paroling the border by billions of dollars over time.
158| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|Planed breaks in the 700 mile fence are filled by mountainous terrain .
158| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|premise|While it is accurate that the fence will not be built in areas of treacherous terrain, the very nature of that terrain will provide a sufficient barrier to illegal crossings.
159| 700 mile US Mexico border fence|conclusion|US border towns should not be benefiting from shoppers that cross illegally.

177| Abolishing intellectual property rights|premise|intellectual property rights impede the point.
178| Abolishing intellectual property rights|conclusion|Cost of monitoring IP rights are high.
178| Abolishing intellectual property rights|premise|Even if IP rights were administered to a piece of work, ensuring that it does not get copied and dealing with plagarism are very costly affairs.

187| Abolition of art subsidies|conclusion|People will pay for good art.
187| Abolition of art subsidies|premise|Government subsidy of the arts is unnecessary as if art is good enough, then people will pay for it.
188| Abolition of art subsidies|conclusion|The arts can survive on profits and business models alone.
188| Abolition of art subsidies|premise|There are alternatives to government subsidy or relying solely on ticket sales to fund the arts.

189| Abolition of art subsidies|premise|Local theatres would be forced to shut, film industries would shrink, national theatre, opera and ballet companies would disband or merge, museums would close their doors.
190| Abolition of art subsidies|conclusion|Subsidies help foster newer more innovative forms of art.
190| Abolition of art subsidies|premise|Commercially-funded arts have to play to the lowest common denominator, avoiding risk by providing what has proved popular and successful in the past (for example, musicals and endless productions of Shakespeare’s As You Like It or Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite).
191| Abolition of art subsidies|conclusion|"Government subsidies will be inefficiently wasted on ""artsy"" flops."
191| Abolition of art subsidies|premise|Even if government subsidy of the arts occasionally produced popular and acclaimed artistic successes, these will always be too infrequent to justify wasting public money on a great many more flops.
192| Abolition of art subsidies|conclusion|There are considerable economic benefits to subsidising the arts.
192| Abolition of art subsidies|premise|Government-backed companies such as the National Theatre or Royal Shakespeare Company in Britain act as centres of excellence, training and nurturing young talent and thus helping to support a thriving commercial artistic sector as well.

201| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Those that seek nuclear weapons are more likely to use them.
201| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|The people that are most likely to use nuclear weapons are the people that are most likely to want to target civilians.
202| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons immorally threaten mass murder.
202| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Over the past fifty years, we have seen a general tendency towards limited warfare and precision weapons, allowing military objectives to be achieved with minimal loss of civilian life.
203| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|The use of nuclear weapons is undemocratic.
203| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|The decision to use nuclear weapons is made by a very small group of people at the top of a nation's leadership.
204| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Many states that could build nuclear weapons haven't.
204| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Many states are technically capable of building nuclear weapons, but have made a moral choice not to.
205| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nukes help deter conflict, which is morally legitimate.
205| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|For those who didn't study the military doctrine of MAD (mutually assured destruction), the doctrine proves that nobody would be mad enough to start launching nukes.
206| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Using nuclear weapons would be a tragedy.
206| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|The reason for maintaining an effective nuclear arsenal is in fact to prevent war.
207| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear deterrence is a superior to doctrines of preventive war.
207| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|On the basis that nuclear weapons can help deter even rogue states from using WMD, it becomes unnecessary to implement a preventive war doctrine to prevent rogue nations from ever acquiring WMD; nuclear deterrence is sufficient.
208| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear umbrellas are the only reason why some state are non-nuclear.
208| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|While some argue that some modern states have opted not to develop nuclear weapons, making it unfair that other states have opted to create them, this ignores the fact that these non-nuclear states often only have the luxury to be non-nuclear due to their protection under the umbrella of a nuclear state.
209| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear deterrence need not target civilian populations.
209| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|"While critics of nuclear weapons often cite the targeting of civilian populations as morally repugnant, this civilian targeting need not be included in the theory of ""nuclear deterrence""."
210| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Terrorists are not deterred by the threat of nuclear weapons.
210| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Terrorists are frequently willing to kill themselves to commit acts of terrorism.
211| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|The idea of a so-called 'nuclear deterrent' no longer applies.
211| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Peace during the Cold War was maintained only by a balance of power - neither superpower had an advantage large enough to be confident of victory.
212| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Great power rivalries maintain importance of nuclear deterrence.
212| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Great power rivalries persist between such countries as the China, Russia, and the United States, even though the United States' is more powerful at this time.
213| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear deterrence remains important in the post-Cold War era.
213| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Many believe that the end of the Cold War spelled the end of the notion of nuclear deterrence.
214| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons deter even rogue states.
214| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Rogue states are often thought to be irrational, making it impossible to deter them with the threat of nuclear weapons.
215| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons deter rogue states from giving WMD to terrorists.
215| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Rogue leaders are unlikely to give WMD or nuclear weapons to terrorists if it will jeopardize the existence of their country or their grip on power.
216| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Small states benefit from having a small nuclear deterrent.
216| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|For small states, even a small nuclear deterrent can be very beneficial to their national interests.
217| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|The deterrent principle still stands.
217| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|During the Gulf War, for example, one of the factors which prevented Iraq from launching missiles tipped with chemical weapon warheads against Israel was the threat the USA would retaliate with a nuclear strike.
218| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons make the world less secure.
218| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|With the many risks associated with nuclear weapons, including accidental firings and mis-calculation, the risks may very well be higher than the presumed benefits.
219| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons must be abolished to avoid nuclear accidents.
219| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Accidents are a common occurrence with nuclear weapons.
220| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear submarine accidents are a global hazard.
220| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Numerous nuclear submarines have accidentally sunk.
221| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons have not reduced the risk of war.
221| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Nuclear states through the Cold War and beyond have been nearly five times as likely as non-nuclear states to be engaged, at any given time, in an international conflict.
222| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|States that have abandoned nuclear weapons have remained safe.
222| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|While there are often fears about the result of a country abandoning nuclear weapons, all states have remained safe in the international system.
223| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons encourage further nuclear proliferation.
223| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|To be a part of the so-called 'nuclear club' is seen as a matter of great prestige; when India and Pakistan recently declared their nuclear capability, it was seen in both countries as increasing their international status.
224| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons could fall into terrorists' hands.
224| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|This is particularly true in Russia, which now had control of all of the nuclear weapons which were distributed around the former Soviet Union.
225| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear deterrence helps prevent conflict.
225| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Of course not.
226| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|US nuclear weapons reduce the intensity of international conflicts.
226| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|The nuclear arsenal of the United States creates a nuclear deterrence umbrella for its allies that helps protect them against various international threats.
227| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|US nuclear weapons help deter and constrain Russia.
227| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Russia's foreign policy under President Putin became highly ambitious and potentially expansionary.
228| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|The plutonium in nuclear warheads cannot simply be destroyed.
228| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Instead, they must be stored in special facilities; in Russia, there are some thousand sites were military nuclear material is stored.
229| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons may protect humans from threats from space.
229| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Nuclear weapons could protect the human race, all other living species on the planet, and the planet itself should it come under threat of alien invasion, a massive asteroid, and so forth if they happen to be the only suitable defense available at the time.
230| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|The threat or use of nuclear weapons is illegal.
230| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|The deterrent effect of nuclear weapons depends on the threat of nuclear weapons to civilian populations of an opposing country.
231| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|The threat or use of nuclear weapons is legal in desperate defense.
231| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|If a country has no other means to defend itself against an imminent threat than by the use of nuclear weapons, a defensive nuclear strike may be legally defensible.
232| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons are a drain on resources.
232| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Nuclear weapons are very expensive to build and expensive to maintain.
233| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear deterrence is important in protecting economic interests.
233| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Nuclear deterrence, by helping limit the potential for large-scale armed conflict between states, is important to protecting national economic interests.
234| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|A nuclear abolition treaty is feasible with worldwide unanimity.
234| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|The only way nuclear abolition can succeed is if it is unanimous and obligatory worldwide.
235| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|A nuclear weapons ban could accompany a chem and biological weapons ban.
235| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|This would help address the concern that, without nuclear weapons, the threat of chemical and biological weapons could not be deterred.
236| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Modern nuclear powers are unlikely to denuclearize.
236| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|There is a clear strategic foreign policy advantage offered to nations with nuclear powers.
237| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear powers may reduce stockpiles but won't fully denuclearize.
237| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Many nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia have huge nuclear weapons stockpiles and are willing to reduce them.
238| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear abolition could not prevent covert nuclear programs.
238| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|While it may be possible to, at one point, achieve the abolition of all nuclear weapons, it is not possible to ensure that some states would not attempt to engage covert nuclear weapons programs.
239| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Abolition can't un-invent nuclear weapons.
239| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|The world knows how to create nuclear weapons.
240| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|It's too tempting to build a nuclear weapon in a non-nuclear world.
240| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|In a non-nuclear world, a state that builds even a single nuclear weapons achieves an enormous leap in geopolitical strength.
241| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|It's not possible to abolish nuclear weapons now that the are at large.
241| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|Nuclear technology exists, and there is no way to un-invent it.
242| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|It's not possible to stop nuclear weapons now.
242| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|They are in too many places and those that are out there aren't going to be found easily, we don't even have a comprehensive list of what countries have them so enforcing it will be hard to do.
243| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Nuclear weapons can not just be simply destroyed or dismantled.
243| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|the radioactive element within the warhead cannot just be turned off or put into storage.
244| Abolition of nuclear weapons|conclusion|Many leaders support abolishing nuclear weapons.
244| Abolition of nuclear weapons|premise|An impressive list of historic international leaders support the abolition of nuclear weapons.

261| Abortion|conclusion|Women should be held responsible for behavior leading to impregnation.
261| Abortion|premise|If one does not want to have a baby, they should not have sex, or they should take extreme precaution when having sex.
262| Abortion|conclusion|A woman's rights are not the only rights that need to be respected in abortion.
262| Abortion|premise|Of course, human-rights should be respected, but it is never the case that a person has a right to make a decision with no reference to the rights and wishes of others.
263| Abortion|conclusion|The scale of abortions makes state intervention compelling.
263| Abortion|premise|Some argue that abortion is an individual moral choice that the state should not get involved with.
264| Abortion|conclusion|"Under a ""veil of ignorance"", the unborn would adopt a pro-life social contract."
264| Abortion|premise|"The ""veil of ignorance"" is a notion put forward by liberal philosopher John Rawls."
265| Abortion|conclusion|A fetus cannot have a right to a woman's body to sustain its life.
265| Abortion|premise|No individual has rights over another individual.
266| Abortion|conclusion|A fetus is no more a human than an acorn is a tree.
266| Abortion|premise|Judith Jarvis Thomson.
267| Abortion|conclusion|"A fetus is not a ""person"" so can't have rights protecting it from abortion."
267| Abortion|premise|"Is terminating a fetus, which can neither feel emotions nor be conscious of its own ""existence,"" really be considered equivalent to killing a ""person?"" Some define personhood (qualifying for rights) through a set of criteria."
268| Abortion|conclusion|The fetus causes physical pain.
268| Abortion|premise|The fetus causes sickness, discomfort, and and extreme pain to a woman during her pregnancy and labor.
269| Abortion|conclusion|Potential of fetus to become a person is not sufficient.
269| Abortion|premise|"Ayn Rand - ""Never mind the vicious nonsense of claiming that an embryo has a 'right to life."
270| Abortion|conclusion|If a fetus had a right to life, abortionists would be subject to murder charges.
270| Abortion|premise|While abortionists claim that fetuses should have a right to life, they would never go so far as to charge abortionists with murder.
271| Abortion|conclusion|Human life and a right to life begin at conception.
271| Abortion|premise|Human life is continuum of growth that starts at conception, not at birth.
272| Abortion|conclusion|Life is an individual right, not a privilege, for unborn humans.
272| Abortion|premise|Mother Teresa, in her amicus brief filed before the U.
273| Abortion|conclusion|A fetus is uniquely capable of becoming a person.
273| Abortion|premise|It is unquestionable that the fetus, at whatever stage of development, will inevitably develop the traits of a full-grown human person.
274| Abortion|conclusion|No one argues that an acorn or even an animal fetus has a “sanctity” or rights.
274| Abortion|premise|No, human beings are in an entirely different class.
275| Abortion|conclusion|"If these criteria for being a ""person"" are valid then killing infants is justifiable."
275| Abortion|premise|Infants also lack self motivation, self-awareness, rationality, autonomy, and the ability to converse on a variety of subjects.
277| Abortion|conclusion|"Women can only be ""pregnant"" with a ""child"" not merely a ""fetus."
277| Abortion|premise|This is similar to the above argument.
278| Abortion|conclusion|Fetuses, as dependents, do have some rights over their mother's body.
278| Abortion|premise|The mother-fetus relationship is unlike any other relationship between individuals.
279| Abortion|conclusion|"Pro-abortionists dehumanize ""fetuses"" to get away with murder."
279| Abortion|premise|"Frederica Matthewes-Green, ""Personhood of the Unborn"", on National Public Radio's All Things Considered, (January 21, 1998) - ""When we question whether someone is a person, it is because we want to kill him."
280| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion deprives a fetus of an entire human future.
280| Abortion|premise|Some argue that abortion is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future.
281| Abortion|conclusion|The unborn are voiceless and should be protected against abortion.
281| Abortion|premise|Ronald Reagan.
282| Abortion|conclusion|That the fetus may do harm to the mother cannot justify destroying it.
282| Abortion|premise|Even when born, a child can inflict much more physical pain on the mother than he can on the womb, his destruction is still illegal.
283| Abortion|conclusion|It is wrong to kill fetuses on the basis that they can't think/feel.
283| Abortion|premise|"On ""the fetus cant think argument"": Animal abuse, suicide and even cutting down a tree are frequently illegal on the basis that these things have some value and should not be destroyed, killed, or treated inhumanely."
284| Abortion|conclusion|Fetuses are conscious in the womb and suffer during abortions.
284| Abortion|premise|Unborn babies have a certain level of consciousness in the womb.
285| Abortion|conclusion|"Even if abortions ""kill life"", it can be justified as upholding a woman's life."
285| Abortion|premise|"Even if a fetus is considered a ""baby"" or human life, abortions can still be justified."
286| Abortion|conclusion|"There is no inviolable ""right to life"" in abortion and other cases."
286| Abortion|premise|"It is clear that the notion of ""the right to life"" can sometimes be violated for certain ends."
287| Abortion|conclusion|Hypocritical to protect fetuses, but casually wage war.
287| Abortion|premise|"Rick Claro - ""George W."
288| Abortion|conclusion|In a free society, abortion is truly a matter of personal belief.
288| Abortion|premise|The issue of abortion debates the question of whether or not the unborn child is a human being, or at what point it becomes so.
289| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion generally devalues the dignity we assign to life.
289| Abortion|premise|"Ronald Reagan, ""Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation"", Human Life Review, Spring 1984 - ""We cannot diminish the value of one category of human life—the unborn—without diminishing the value of all human life."
290| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion sets precedent of valuing some humans less than others.
290| Abortion|premise|"Ronald Reagan, ""Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation"", Human Life Review, Spring 1984."
292| Abortion|conclusion|"Uncertainty over whether fetuses are ""life"" should halt abortions."
292| Abortion|premise|There are strong arguments in favor of fetuses being life from conception and some strong arguments against.
293| Abortion|conclusion|Human life is continuum.
293| Abortion|premise|"George Carlin, comedian - ""People say 'life begins at conception."
294| Abortion|conclusion|Abortions encourage infanticide.
294| Abortion|premise|"Ronald Reagan, ""Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation"", Human Life Review, Spring 1984."
295| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is murder just as infanticide is murder.
295| Abortion|premise|It cannot be said that the abortion of a nine-month-old fetus is much different than the killing of a three day old baby.
296| Abortion|conclusion|Killing helpless fetus is incomparable to death of willing soldier.
296| Abortion|premise|How can you compare an unborn baby to the willing beings that fight in wars they have choosen the fate of going to war and the know of the harsh consquenses that may follow.
297| Abortion|conclusion|"""Back alley"" abortions are more frequent when abortion is illegal."
297| Abortion|premise|"Back-alley abortions are abortions performed illegally on the ""black-market"" when abortion is generally illegal."
298| Abortion|conclusion|Legal abortions safer than black market abortions.
298| Abortion|premise|"Mary Calderone, founder of SIECUS and medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, ""Illegal abortion as a public health problem,"" American Journal of Public Health, July 1960 - ""90% of illegal abortions are being done by physicians."
299| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion does not negatively affect a woman's sexual functions.
299| Abortion|premise|A study conducted at University of Copenhagen has shown legal abortion is associated with few adverse effects on sexual function among women in Denmark.
300| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is no more risky or harmful than ordinary birth.
300| Abortion|premise|While abortion has it's risks, it's important that we compare it against the alternative, which is going through with giving birth.
301| Abortion|conclusion|Abortions are very risky and hazardous to the women.
301| Abortion|premise|"Warren Hern, abortion practitioner and author of Abortion Practice (1990), the textbook most widely used in the United States to teach abortion to medical personnel - ""In medical practice, there are few surgical procedures given so little attention and so underrated in its potential hazard as abortion."
302| Abortion|conclusion|"Preventing ""back alley"" abortions are no reason to legalize abortion."
302| Abortion|premise|That the illegality of abortion may lead to back-alley abortions is not a reason to legalize abortion.
303| Abortion|conclusion|Abortions are emotionally and psychologically unsafe.
303| Abortion|premise|If by 'safe' you mean that a woman can survive, then the answer is possibly.
304| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion allows women to become better people without a child.
304| Abortion|premise|"Rachel Kramer Bussel, ""I'm Pro-Choice and I Fuck"", Village Voice, January 13, 2006 - ""I'm pro-choice because I couldn't fully enjoy sex were I consumed with worry about the potential consequences."
305| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion allows women to have sex comfortably without fear of pregnancy.
305| Abortion|premise|"Rachel Kramer Bussel, ""I'm Pro-Choice and I Fuck"", Village Voice, January 13, 2006 - ""I'm pro-choice because I couldn't fully enjoy sex were I consumed with worry about the potential consequences."
306| Abortion|conclusion|"No woman ""wants"" an abortion."
306| Abortion|premise|"Women do not ""want"" abortions."
307| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion advocates wrongly value quality of life over sanctity of life.
307| Abortion|premise|"Ronald Reagan, ""Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation"", Human Life Review, Spring 1984 - ""As a nation, we must choose between the sanctity of life ethic and the 'quality of life' ethic."
308| Abortion|conclusion|Child-rearing is a beautiful, natural process, not a burden.
308| Abortion|premise|Victoria Woodhull, first woman to run for U.
309| Abortion|conclusion|On abortion the issue is when love not life begins.
309| Abortion|premise|"Robert Casey, former Governor of Pennsylvania - ""When we look to the unborn child, the real issue is not when life begins, but when love begins."
310| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion worsens parenting by devaluing the parent-child relationship.
310| Abortion|premise|If an unborn child is seen as expendable, the parent comes to believe that their relationship with the unborn child is conditional and non-binding.
312| Abortion|conclusion|The child's life is being taken away.
312| Abortion|premise|His or her life is gone before he or she has gotten a chance to live.
313| Abortion|conclusion|Post-abortion syndrome is not a medically recognized syndrome.
313| Abortion|premise|The American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association do not recognize PAS.
314| Abortion|conclusion|It is better to regret not having a child than regret having one.
314| Abortion|premise|It is clear that abortion is a choice between evils.
315| Abortion|conclusion|Many women are disturbed by their abortions but remain pro-choice.
315| Abortion|premise|"Rosemary Candelario, director of Massachusetts Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, September 2001 - ""I think the fear in the abortion rights movement is if we admit abortion is hard for some women, then we're admitting that it's wrong, which is totally not the case."
316| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion may have a positive or neutral impact on the emotions of the women.
316| Abortion|premise|Multiple studies find a positive or neutral correlation between abortion and mental and emotional health.
317| Abortion|conclusion|Risk-taking and disorders lead to abortions.
317| Abortion|premise|This argument is partly a response to studies that claim that there is a correlation between abortion and mental disorders.
318| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion often leads to regret, depression, and even mental illness.
318| Abortion|premise|Carol Everett - “The product, abortion, is skillfully marketed and sold to the woman at the crisis time in her life.
319| Abortion|conclusion|Alcoholism and drug-use are common after abortions.
319| Abortion|premise|There are many reports of woman falling into not only depression, but spates of alcoholism and drug-use after having abortions.
320| Abortion|conclusion|Fewer women would have abortions if they knew what they were doing.
320| Abortion|premise|"Bernard Nathanson, former abortion doctor turned pro-life, in his book Aborting America, 1979 - ""Fewer women would have abortions if wombs had windows."
321| Abortion|conclusion|The lives of women have been destroyed by abortion, not enhanced.
321| Abortion|premise|"Norma McCorvey, the anonymous litigant known as ""Jane Roe"" in the landmark abortion case, Roe vs."
322| Abortion|conclusion|It is better to seek abortion than neglect a born child.
322| Abortion|premise|It is unfair to give birth to a child that will be neglected, underfed, under-educated, and that will likely lead an unfulfilling life.
323| Abortion|conclusion|Adoption is too risky making it a poor alternative to abortion.
323| Abortion|premise|"Kristin Luker, Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood (1984) - ""Having a baby and giving it up for adoption, as pro-life people advocate, is not seen by most pro-choice people as a moral solution to the abortion problem."
324| Abortion|conclusion|Adoption does not spare a women the pains/risks of childbirth.
324| Abortion|premise|One of the main reasons that an abortion makes sense is that it spares women of the pains and risks of child-birth.
325| Abortion|conclusion|Adoption can be as emotionally damaging as abortion.
325| Abortion|premise|Giving up a child for adoption can be just as emotionally damaging as having an abortion.
326| Abortion|conclusion|Unborn life should never depend on whether it is wanted.
326| Abortion|premise|"Graciela Olivarez, Chicana civil rights and anti-poverty activist, 1972 - ""The poor cry out for justice and equality, and we respond with legalized abortion."
327| Abortion|conclusion|"""Unwanted"" children can be adopted."
327| Abortion|premise|Mother Teresa of Calcutta quotes (Albanian born Indian Missionary and Founder of the Order of the Missionaries of Charity.
328| Abortion|conclusion|Support can be given to women who can't support a child.
328| Abortion|premise|"Ronald Reagan, ""Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation"", Human Life Review, Spring 1984."
329| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is not a just response to social problems facing the unborn.
329| Abortion|premise|If a child is likely to face social difficulties, this is absolutely no reason to seek an abortion.
330| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion deprives couples that want to adopt of a potential child.
330| Abortion|premise|There are many infertile couples around the world or people that would simply like to adopt children.
331| Abortion|conclusion|A woman must bear the pain/risks of birth.
331| Abortion|premise|If the woman was the only consideration in abortions, than it might make sense for them to avoid the pain of child-birth.
332| Abortion|conclusion|It is just for a mother to abort a fetus to save herself.
332| Abortion|premise|In such cases of medical emergency and in the interest of saving a women's life, surely it is permissible to abort the fetus.
333| Abortion|conclusion|Legal abortion protects women with serious illnesses that are vulnerable.
333| Abortion|premise|Tens of thousands of women have heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia and severe diabetes, and other illnesses that are made worse by childbearing.
334| Abortion|conclusion|If abortion in self-defense is OK, a fetus cannot have a general right to life.
334| Abortion|premise|Opponents of abortion often argue that a fetus has an inviolable right to life.
335| Abortion|conclusion|A child should not be killed to save a mother.
335| Abortion|premise|Whilst these are different circumstances, and such medical emergencies are tragic, it is by no means obvious that the abortion is to be performed.
336| Abortion|conclusion|"Abortions under ""trying circumstances"" are the exception not the rule."
336| Abortion|premise|Most abortions are performed entirely voluntarily by women that have the means to raise a child, but simply don't want to.
337| Abortion|conclusion|Letting a woman die is better than directly killing an unborn baby.
337| Abortion|premise|There is a difference between letting a woman die from the presence of a fetus and the process of giving birth and actively killing a fetus.
338| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion must be justified in cases of impregnation by rape.
338| Abortion|premise|Woman, and in some cases girls, who have been raped should not have to suffer the additional torment of being pregnant with the product of that ordeal.
339| Abortion|conclusion|Rape is an arbitrary exception.
339| Abortion|premise|Many opponents of abortion allow for abortion in instances of rape.
340| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion prevents victims of rape from becoming unready mothers.
340| Abortion|premise|In cases where the rape victims cannot afford or is not ready to have a child, abortion can do both the victim and the unborn baby a favour.
341| Abortion|conclusion|Rape does not qualify abortion.
341| Abortion|premise|Denying someone life because of the circumstances of their conception is unfair.
342| Abortion|conclusion|A rape victim can put their baby up for adoption.
342| Abortion|premise|Why can't a rape victim put their child up for adoption? Isn't this an adequate resolution to the problem? The only reason it might not be an adequate resolution are the risks and pains of child-birth and perhaps the difficulty of separating from the child.
343| Abortion|conclusion|Having an abortion is just as wrong as the rape itself.
343| Abortion|premise|The child has a right to life just as much as that woman had the right to not be raped.
344| Abortion|conclusion|If women  are solely burdened by pregnancy, they must have a choice.
344| Abortion|premise|Men are dominant in their ability to impregnate a woman, but carry no responsibilities afterward.
345| Abortion|conclusion|Opposition to abortion is based largely on sexism toward women.
345| Abortion|premise|Florynce R.
346| Abortion|conclusion|It is odd to defend the dignity of a fetus over a child-rearer.
346| Abortion|premise|There is a peculiar double standard being applied by opponents of abortion.
347| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion fails to liberate women as intended.
347| Abortion|premise|Instead of freeing women, abortion places women in a new prison of regret and torment.
348| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion opens the door to the sexual exploitation of women.
348| Abortion|premise|The existence of abortion gives men a little more of a safeguard against unintentionally impregnating a woman.
349| Abortion|conclusion|Rejecting abortion and going through with pregnancies empowers women.
349| Abortion|premise|"Patricia Heaton, Emmy-winning actress, Washington Times, (April 14, 2005) - ""The early feminists found abortion to be the ultimate exploitation of women."
350| Abortion|conclusion|Abortions are mostly sought when birth control fails.
350| Abortion|premise|Clayton H.
351| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is just when birth control fails .
351| Abortion|premise|If a woman does not voluntarily choose to seek a pregnancy, it is impossible for a fetus to have any claim over the woman's body.
352| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is wrongly sought as an alternative form of birth control.
352| Abortion|premise|"Kristin Luker, Taking Chances: Abortion and the Decision Not to Contracept (1975) - ""In short, there are no empirical grounds for assuming that women have an à priori preference for contraception over abortion."
353| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is justified when the fetus is certain to suffer and die from a disability.
353| Abortion|premise|Finally, due to advances in medical technology it is possible to determine during pregnancy whether the child will be disabled.
356| Abortion|conclusion|Viability is a good cut-off for when abortion is appropriate or not.
356| Abortion|premise|Anthony Kennedy, U.
357| Abortion|conclusion|"A line on ""viability"" is arbitrary."
357| Abortion|premise|"It is faulty to claim that a fetus can achieve ""viability"", where it becomes an independent creature and worthy of some rights."
358| Abortion|conclusion|A ban on abortion presents practical problems of enforcement.
358| Abortion|premise|Enforcing an abortion ban would require a quite degrading and inhumane treatment of those women who wished to have their foetus terminated.
359| Abortion|conclusion|Difficulties of enforcement should not diminish the principles of the law.
359| Abortion|premise|Many laws have difficulties pertaining to implementation, but these do not diminish the strength of the principle behind them: people will kill other people, regardless of your legislating against it, but it does not follow that you shouldn’t legislate against it.
360| Abortion|conclusion|Doctors that have difficulty performing abortions still acknowledge its importance.
360| Abortion|premise|Many people have trouble with parts of their profession.
361| Abortion|conclusion|Doctors that perform abortions are often emotionally damaged.
361| Abortion|premise|"Anonymous abortion doctor, quoted by Jack Hitt in ""Who Will Do Abortions Here?"", New York Times Magazine, January 18, 1998 - ""Doing abortions can make you feel bad ."
362| Abortion|conclusion|The Hippocratic oath forbids doctors from performing abortions.
362| Abortion|premise|Hippocratic Oath, attributed to the school of Hippocrates, the “Father of Medicine,” circa 400 B.
363| Abortion|conclusion|It is contradictory to oppose abortion while supporting capital punishment.
363| Abortion|premise|"Loesje, Dutch Fictional character ""Active and International girl"", b."
364| Abortion|conclusion|An abortion kills innocents.
364| Abortion|premise|There is no contradiction between opposing abortions and supporting capital punishment, as many conservatives do.
365| Abortion|conclusion|The reproductive rights movement has no genocidal drive.
365| Abortion|premise|No serious proponents of abortion are out to kill all embryos.
366| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is a form of eugenics and mass murder.
366| Abortion|premise|"Norman Haire, letter to the editor, Birth Control Review, (July, 1930) - ""For those who cannot be educated, sterilization or legalized abortion seems to be the only remedy, for we certainly do not want such stupid people to pollute the race with stupid offspring."
367| Abortion|conclusion|Poor women are disproportionately deprived choice when abortion is illegal.
367| Abortion|premise|Poor woman are most susceptible to circumstances in which abortion is necessary.
368| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion ban may harm poor, but does not change case against it.
368| Abortion|premise|"Kristin Luker, Dubious Conceptions (1996) - ""."
369| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion is more likely to wipe out the bad than the good.
369| Abortion|premise|This argument is based on the premise that poverty and conditions conducive to crime often correlate to those that seek abortions.
370| Abortion|conclusion|It is wrong to consider abortion a tool in crime prevention.
370| Abortion|premise|Stephen J.
371| Abortion|conclusion|Pro-life militant groups act violently in opposition to abortion.
371| Abortion|premise|Many pro-life activists act violently in opposition to abortion.
372| Abortion|conclusion|Pro-lifers are justified in showing gruesome images of abortions.
372| Abortion|premise|These images reflect the reality of what is being done with abortions.
373| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion might forestall the potential birth of another Hitler.
373| Abortion|premise|This is a counter-argument to the notion that abortion could have wiped out some of the greatest social contributors in history; it also could have wiped out some of the worst individuals in history.
374| Abortion|conclusion|"If a fetus was defined as a ""person"", the legal shifts would be too dramatic."
374| Abortion|premise|No abortions would be permitted for any reason, including rape or incest.
375| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion forestalls the potential societal contributions of a human being.
375| Abortion|premise|It may even wipe out the life of an individual that could have resolved, for example, the Middle East crisis or cured cancer.
376| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion undermines the dignity of life, promotes violence.
376| Abortion|premise|Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Missionary and Founder of the Order of the Missionaries of Charity.
377| Abortion|conclusion|Christian leaders throughout history have been opposed to abortion.
377| Abortion|premise|Christianity holds that a human life is a human life and taking a human life that does not pose an imminent threat to yours is wrong, outside of legitimate war and capital punishment.
378| Abortion|conclusion|The right to abort does not depend on its explicit constitutional provision.
378| Abortion|premise|Sarah Weddington, the lawyer who argued Roe v.
379| Abortion|conclusion|The US Constitution does not explicitly confer a right to abortion.
379| Abortion|premise|Byron White, U.
380| Abortion|conclusion|The Declaration of Independence states we have a right to Life .
380| Abortion|premise|One of the intentions of our founding documents, in describing our inalienable rights in liberty, is that a one person or group of people cannot exercise tyrannical power to take Life away from another person or group of persons.
381| Abortion|conclusion|Pro-choice uphold democratic principles of free choice.
381| Abortion|premise|America was founded upon the principles of freedom of religion.
382| Abortion|conclusion|Abortion has been opposed by important figures throughout history.

384| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|"""Young people who become sexually active are vulnerable to emotional and psychological injury as well as to physical diseases."
385| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|conclusion|Comprehensive sex ed fosters an irresponsible sexual culture.
385| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|Comprehensive sex ed and forms of contraception such as Plan B make it appear acceptable to have rampant sex without taking full responsibility for unintended pregnancies, among other possible consequences.
386| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|conclusion|Abstinence-only promotes healthy, fulfilling relationships.
386| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|"""Abstinence programs offer a holistic approach, teaching teens how to build healthy relationships, increase self-worth and set appropriate boundaries in order to achieve future goals."

387| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|"""Young people who become sexually active enter an arena of high-risk behavior that leads to physical and emotional damage."
388| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|conclusion|Comprehensive sex ed rightly teaches about sexual pleasure.
388| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|"Susan Wilson, a US school teacher, said to a reporter from the Atlantic in 1994, ""it is developmentally appropriate for teenagers to learn to give and receive pleasure."
389| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|conclusion|Abstinence-only wrongly teaches suppression of sexual impulses.
389| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|Individuals should not deny their natural sexual impulses.
390| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|conclusion|Abstinence-only sometimes encourages oral/anal sex alternatives.

391| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|conclusion|Sex-ed empowers informed decisions about risks of sex.
391| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|"""While teen pregnancies have fallen recently, sexually transmitted diseases, especially among young girls, have been on the rise  A study earlier this year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that one in four young women ages 14 to 19 was infected with at least one of four common sexually transmitted diseases  To make good decisions, teenagers need to know all of their options - including abstinence."
392| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|conclusion|Sex-ed teaches nothing new in a culture of sex.
392| Abstinence-only vs. comprehensive sex education|premise|Increasing rates of teenage STIs, pregnancy and the shocking rise in abortion is more to do with the oft cited decaying fabric of society's values in relationships, family and life.

536| Affirmative action|conclusion|Affirmative action allows the best to rise by countering systemic exclusion.
536| Affirmative action|premise|Affirmative Action actually ensures that, on average, the best candidate is selected precisely because affirmative action systematically includes individuals from groups that are otherwise systematically excluded.
537| Affirmative action|conclusion|"Affirmative action makes race only a small ""plus"" for candidates."
537| Affirmative action|premise|"""racial or ethnic background, at Harvard, might be deemed a 'plus' in a particular applicant's file, yet it does not insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats."

551| Affirmative action|conclusion|Schools have right to improve diversity in ways of their choosing.
551| Affirmative action|premise|"""Diversity is many things—so many things, in fact, that institutions will think it worthwhile to concentrate on some diversity factors rather than others."
552| Affirmative action|conclusion|Minority schools disprove perceived value of diversity.
552| Affirmative action|premise|In order for a diverse learning environment to be seen as important or necessary, minority schools (homogeneous) must be demonstrated as a bad idea.
553| Affirmative action|conclusion|Diverse schools receive poor ratings from students.
553| Affirmative action|premise|The article shows an inverse relationship between the number of minorities on campus and the favorable ratings students give of the quality of their education.
554| Affirmative action|conclusion|Cultural exchange does not require diversity in workplace.
554| Affirmative action|premise|When most people use the word diversity, they are usually misusing the term and actually are referring to the strength of the concept of unity and of cultural exchange.

609| AIG bonuses|conclusion|Allowing AIG bonuses would undermine government-citizen trust.
609| AIG bonuses|premise|There is such public outrage over the AIG bailouts, government action in reneging or taxing the bonuses is necessary to maintain a healthy relationship and trust between government and citizens in this trying time.

638| Airport security profiling|conclusion|Profiling will help avoid invasive scanners and pat-downs.
638| Airport security profiling|premise|Body-scanning and patting-down all travelers, including older disabled men and women, is excessive and often invasive.
639| Airport security profiling|conclusion|Broad security screening wastes scarce security resources.

641| Airport security profiling|premise|"""Body scanners should have been deployed years ago as the threat of a passenger carrying explosives on their body is not a recent discovery."
642| Airport security profiling|conclusion|Broad screening at airports does make us safer.
642| Airport security profiling|premise|"""As counterintuitive as it may seem, we’re all more secure when we randomly select people for secondary screening — even if it means occasionally screening wheelchair-bound grandmothers and innocent looking children."

649| Alcohol ban|conclusion|We need consistency in our drug laws.
649| Alcohol ban|premise|If cannabis, which is not very addictive and which results in virtually no violent crime or public disorder, needs to be banned because of its mind-altering effects, then how much more so should alcohol be banned.
650| Alcohol ban|conclusion|We should have consistent drug laws, so legalize cannabis.
650| Alcohol ban|premise|Cannabis and alcohol should both be legal drugs since the vast majority of people know how to use them safely and responsibly.
651| Alcohol ban|conclusion|The immorality of alcohol outweighs the costs of a ban on alcohol to the industry.

679| Algae biofuel|premise|"""Ponds also need a lot of space, because sunlight only penetrates the upper layers of a water body."
680| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel requires too much land, harming the environment.
680| Algae biofuel|premise|"""Ponds also need a lot of space, because sunlight only penetrates the upper layers of a water body."
681| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel is biodegradable.
681| Algae biofuel|premise|One advantage of many biofuels over most other fuel types is that they are biodegradable, and so relatively harmless to the environment if spilled.
682| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel is a renewable resource.
682| Algae biofuel|premise|"Glen Kertz, president and CEO of Valcent Products, told CNN while conducting a tour of his algae greenhouse on the outskirts of El Paso - ""Algae is the ultimate in renewable energy."
683| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel has to be created from scratch.
683| Algae biofuel|premise|"""Minuses: Unlike cellulosic ethanol, the biomass for making a lot of fuel from algae doesn't yet exist; it has to be grown from scratch."
684| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algal fuels do not impact fresh water resources.
684| Algae biofuel|premise|Algae can be grown in the ocean, freshwater, and wastewater and sewage.
685| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel can grow in salt water, freshwater or contaminated water.
685| Algae biofuel|premise|There is no limit to the kinds of water where algae can be grown and used in producing biofuel.
686| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Human waste and sewage can be used to grow algae biofuel.
686| Algae biofuel|premise|"""It is possible to use human sewage and wastewater from agricultural endeavors to enhance the growth of algae."
687| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel requires substantial quantities of water.
687| Algae biofuel|premise|Algae requires pools of standing water - not just water in the soil - to grow.
688| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Lining ponds to meet groundwater regulations is expensive.
688| Algae biofuel|premise|"""3."
689| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae can filter C02 from coal and be used for biofuel.
689| Algae biofuel|premise|Power plants that emit large quantities of C02 can be fitted with algae biofuel systems, in which waste C02 is used by algae in the process of photosynthesis, creating as a result a useful biofuel.
690| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Using algae to filter coal then burning it emits captured C02.
690| Algae biofuel|premise|"""Algal fuel can even be considered a worse idea than ""clean"" coal."
691| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae from coal ties the biofuel to fossil fuels.
691| Algae biofuel|premise|"""capturing CO2 from power plants ties algal fuel production to fossil fuels."
692| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel is more practical than solar power.
692| Algae biofuel|premise|"""It’s a big deal because algae don’t just create energy from the sun…they create energy from the sun more effectively than anything else save photovoltaic panels."
693| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Solar power is greener than algae biofuel.
693| Algae biofuel|premise|"""The water issue is not the only 'detail' that threatens the energy efficiency of algal fuel."
694| Algae biofuel|conclusion|Algae biofuel requires less land.
694| Algae biofuel|premise|The United States Department of Energy estimates that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the United States, it would require 15,000 square miles (40,000 square kilometers), which is a few thousand square miles larger than Maryland, or 1.

695| Algae biofuel|premise|"""While the first generation of biofuels is wreaking havoc on the environment and the food markets, the second generation is getting ready to make things only worse."
696| Ammonia fuel|conclusion|Ammonia can be stored and handled much easier than hydrogen.
696| Ammonia fuel|premise|Ammonia can be readily liquefied under only modest pressure at room temperature and can be stored in tanks similar to those used for LPG.
697| Animal rights|conclusion|Animals should have rights on the basis that they can think and feel pain.
697| Animal rights|premise|Human beings are complex evolved creatures who are accorded rights on the basis that they are able to think and to feel pain.
698| Animal rights|conclusion|"Human infants and the mentally handicapped don't have many of the capacities that are argued as warranting humans' exclusive possession of ""rights""."
698| Animal rights|premise|Chimpanzees may have greater IQs than some infants or mentally handicapped.
699| Animal rights|conclusion|"Setting ""standards"" such as intelligence for ""rights"" has the risk of alienating humans without these characteristics."
699| Animal rights|premise|If we place high standards (such as the ability to think, speak, or even to enter into a social contract, act dutifully) on the ascription of rights there is also a danger than not only animals, but also human infants and mentally handicapped adults will be excluded from basic rights.
700| Animal rights|conclusion|"The higher complexity of humans warrants that we alone should have ""rights""."
700| Animal rights|premise|Human beings are infinitely more complex than any other living creatures.
701| Animal rights|conclusion|Our evolutionary attachment to other animals demands that they receive the respect of rights.
701| Animal rights|premise|Ever since the publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species in 1859 we have known that human beings are related by common descent to all other animals.
702| Animal rights|conclusion|Offering rights to living creatures on the basis of evolutionary attachment is a slippery slope.
702| Animal rights|premise|The fact that we are (incredibly distantly) related to other animals does not mean that it makes sense to talk about them having ‘rights’.
704| Animal rights|conclusion|Animals do not have the ability to enter into social contracts with duties, so they should not be offered any rights.
704| Animal rights|premise|Rights are privileges that come with certain social duties and moral responsibilities.
705| Animal rights|conclusion|Cruelty to animals  is the sign of an uncivilized society.
705| Animal rights|premise|it encourages violence and barbarism in society more generally.
706| Animal rights|conclusion|It is perfectly natural to use animals for our own nutrition and pleasure.
706| Animal rights|premise|In the wild there is much suffering as animals struggle to survive, are hunted by predators, and compete for food and resources.
707| Animal rights|conclusion|It is necessary for humans to use animals as a source of food.
707| Animal rights|premise|There is a hierarchy in the natural world, and some living beings have more value than others.
715| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals cannot possess rights because they have no moral judgement.
715| Animal testing|premise|The ability to reason and to express a free will is essential to rights.
716| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals cannot make moral claims so cannot claim rights.
716| Animal testing|premise|"""The differing targets, contents, and sources of rights, and their inevitable conflict, together weave a tangled web."
717| Animal testing|conclusion|That the retarded have rights does not justify animal rights.
717| Animal testing|premise|This is frequent argument of animal rights activists; that animals deserve rights because they have at least as much capacity to reason as do some retarded humans, who retain rights.
718| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal rights reduce humans to mere animals, not made in God's image.
718| Animal testing|premise|David R.
719| Animal testing|conclusion|Granting rights to animals would damage human rights.
719| Animal testing|premise|Offering animals rights impedes on many human rights.
720| Animal testing|conclusion|Protecting animals from suffering by humans is a matter of animal welfare not rights.
720| Animal testing|premise|Many supposed animal rights activists claim that they desire to see animals have a right against suffering at the hands of humans.
721| Animal testing|conclusion|Humans have an evolutionary right to uphold self-interests by testing animals.
721| Animal testing|premise|Humans are creatures of evolution.
722| Animal testing|conclusion|It is more humane to perform tests on animals than on humans.
722| Animal testing|premise|Testing substances on humans without being aware of the potential dangers would be more unethical than testing animals.
723| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals deserve the same basic rights that humans enjoy.
723| Animal testing|premise|"""Animal testing generally occurs as a result of developing a cost-benefit model."
725| Animal testing|conclusion|Humans have a choice and thus responsibility to do no harm to animals.
725| Animal testing|premise|Many opponents of animal rights and supporters of testing cite the fact that animals kill each other without public outcry, and ask, why humans should be held to a higher standard? The answer is that humans have the capacity to make the choice to inflict pain on animals.
726| Animal testing|conclusion|Killing animals should be viewed as equivalent to killing humans.
726| Animal testing|premise|"Leonardo Da Vinci - ""The time will come when people such as I will look upon the murder of (other) animals as they no look upon the murder of human beings."
727| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals should be treated as we would want to be treated.
727| Animal testing|premise|"Christine Stevens - ""The basis of all animal rights should be the Golden Rule: we should treat them as we would wish them to treat us, were any other species in our dominant position."
728| Animal testing|conclusion|Modern humans have lost touch with animals and our likeness.
728| Animal testing|premise|A number of writers indicate that modern humans have become desensitized to animals, having lost daily contact with them in the wild.
729| Animal testing|conclusion|Humans must respect animal rights even if animals can't reciprocate.
729| Animal testing|premise|"""6."
730| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal rights can be assigned according to animal psychology.
730| Animal testing|premise|Jeremy Bentham - While critics question where the line would be drawn, fearing that animal rights activists would grant rights to single cell organisms, the general consensus in the animal rights community is that rights should be conferred only to animals that can suffer.
731| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing wrongly involves sentient, human-like creatures.
731| Animal testing|premise|"""Though we perform testing on animals, and even eat the ones with less fur, we are not cannibals; we do not torture our own."
732| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals are like vulnerable minorities that can't vote to end abuses.
732| Animal testing|premise|"""To my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being."
733| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals denied rights for human-unlikeness are experimented on for human-likeness.
733| Animal testing|premise|Charles R.
739| Animal testing|conclusion|Human life is of greater intrinsic value than animal life.
739| Animal testing|premise|"""beings that lack a rational faculty also lack the capacity to contribute creatively to the values in nature."
741| Animal testing|conclusion|Human and animal differences do not justify speciism/discrimination.
741| Animal testing|premise|"""But even assuming that animals are so very different from us, where does this concept of difference justifying mistreatment come from? Is it supported in the modern ethics of developed countries? It certainly was not the principle justifying our war against Nazism, the better part of a century ago, let alone its more subtle ethical variant of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s."
742| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal life is equivalent in value to human life.
742| Animal testing|premise|"""To my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being."
743| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals are equal to humans in science as lifeforms on Earth.
743| Animal testing|premise|"""Explanation: The philosophy of animal rights is respectful of our best science in general and evolutionary biology in particular."
744| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals have emotions, personalities, and souls just like humans.
744| Animal testing|premise|"Henry David Thoreau - ""I saw deep in the eyes of the animals the human soul look out upon me."
745| Animal testing|conclusion|Humans can do wrong so can be morally inferior to animals.
745| Animal testing|premise|Humans are uniquely capable of acting immorally.
746| Animal testing|conclusion|It is a misconception that all animal testing involves pain.
746| Animal testing|premise|Many forms of animal testing do not inflict any pain on the animal.
747| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals feel and suffer in very similar ways as humans.
747| Animal testing|premise|"""Nearly all the external signs that lead us to infer pain in other humans can be seen in other species, especially the species most closely related to us--the species of mammals and birds."
748| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing has significantly improved human welfare.
748| Animal testing|premise|Past experience has shown what invaluable advances can be made in medicine by experimenting on animals, and that live animals are the most reliable subjects for testing medicines and other products for toxicity.
749| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals are good research subjects because they are similar to humans.
749| Animal testing|premise|Human beings share over 99.
750| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal environments can be better controlled for research than humans.
750| Animal testing|premise|"""In addition, scientists can easily control the environment around the animal (diet, temperature, lighting, etc."
751| Animal testing|conclusion|Differences between humans and animals can be accounted for in tests.
751| Animal testing|premise|"""While monkeys receive drugs in the laboratory, they do not become ""addicted"" in the same sense that humans become addicted."
752| Animal testing|conclusion|Drug toxicity is rarely a result of any misleading animal testing.
752| Animal testing|premise|There are many factors involved in a drug being reported as toxic that are often cited as a result of animal-testing, but which have to do with other factors, such as human error in use or typical blood-type responses to particular drugs.
753| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing has helped develop important drug treatments.
753| Animal testing|premise|"""Antibiotics, HIV drugs, insulin and cancer treatments rely on animal tests."
754| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal experiments have helped develop disease vaccines.
754| Animal testing|premise|"""Animal testing has helped to develop vaccines against diseases like rabies, polio, measles, mumps, rubella and TB""."
755| Animal testing|conclusion|Responsibly ending animal testing will not impede medical advancements.
755| Animal testing|premise|Animal testing is not the core of medical advancements in the world.
756| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal tests too infrequently lead to scientific advancements.
756| Animal testing|premise|While it is undeniable that scientific advancements have been made on account of animal experimentation, these advancements have been too rare to justify animal testing.
757| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal responses to tests can be different than human responses.
757| Animal testing|premise|"""One of the main arguments against the use of animals in research is that animal studies can't actually confirm or refute hypotheses about human physiology or pathology."
758| Animal testing|conclusion|Medicines tested successfully on animals can prove toxic to humans.
758| Animal testing|premise|"Uncaged - ""to subject animals to painful, distressing and lethal experiments when the results are not applicable to humans."
759| Animal testing|conclusion|American Anti-Vivisection Society. Animal Testing.
759| Animal testing|premise|"""We must remember, however, that animals are not 'little people,' and their bodies often respond differently than ours do."
760| Animal testing|conclusion|Cosmetic testing on animals is pointless, given different skin types.
760| Animal testing|premise|A chimp's skin is very different than the skin of a human.
765| Animal testing|conclusion|The world has benefited hugely from medical research with animals.
765| Animal testing|premise|"""everybody has benefited immensely from scientific research involving animals and that virtually every medical achievement in the past century has depended directly or indirectly from this type of work."
766| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing and suffering is justified if it reducing human suffering.
766| Animal testing|premise|So that if there is a decent chance that an experiment will result in an important medical breakthrough that will reduce human suffering and death then it is justifiable to allow animal suffering.
767| Animal testing|conclusion|Animals are important to testing life-saving drugs before they are safe for humans.
767| Animal testing|premise|"""animals allow us to test possibly life-saving treatments before they are considered safe to test in humans."
768| Animal testing|conclusion|Testing on sentient creatures is necessary.
768| Animal testing|premise|While it is true that it is considered worse to harm sentient creatures than microbes and less-sentient creatures, sentient creatures are the most like humans and so the most valuable for making discoveries that are applicable to humans.
769| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal tests proceed only when animal suffering is worth it.
769| Animal testing|premise|The potential human benefits of a particular animal test are typically weighed against the harms that it will entail for animals.
771| Animal testing|conclusion|The ends  don't justify the means .
771| Animal testing|premise|It is a common argument that it is dangerous and invalid for the ends to justify the means in society.
772| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing may benefit human science, but costs human morals.
772| Animal testing|premise|"George Bernard Shaw - ""Vivisection is a social evil because if it advances human knowledge, it does so at the expense of human character."
773| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal rights promotes the true science of humans and animals as kin.
773| Animal testing|premise|Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin.
774| Animal testing|conclusion|Societies that adopt animal rights progress morally.
774| Animal testing|premise|Because animal rights can be seen as an individual moral advancement, it can also bee seen as a societal moral advancement.
775| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal rights is not anti-science, but ethics must constrain science.
775| Animal testing|premise|Many argue that animal rights activists are simply anti-science.
776| Animal testing|conclusion|Philosophy of compassion for animals is better than testing benefits.
776| Animal testing|premise|"George Bernard Shaw - ""Vivisection is a social evil because if it advances human knowledge, it does so at the expense of human character."
777| Animal testing|conclusion|The benefits to human beings cannot outweigh the suffering of the animals.
777| Animal testing|premise|Bernard Rollin argues that any benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering.
778| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing for non-life-saving human products is unjust.
778| Animal testing|premise|"""Animals are still used to test items like cleaning products, which benefit mankind less than medicines or surgery""."
779| Animal testing|conclusion|Testing impregnated animals and their offspring is immoral.
779| Animal testing|premise|Oregon Regional Primate Research Center are known to impregnate monkeys, expose the mothers and their unborn babies to nicotine, and then test and kill the born baby to discover the effects of tobacco.
780| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing and farming is comparable to Nazi genocide.
780| Animal testing|premise|"Ingrid Newkirk (PETA) - ""Six million Jews died in concentration camps, but six billion broiler chickens will die this year in slaughter houses."
781| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing has improved understanding of animals and their welfare.
781| Animal testing|premise|What is often overlooked in this debate is the subject of veterinary medicine.
782| Animal testing|conclusion|Humans must give consent before medicines are tested on them - animals never give consent.
782| Animal testing|premise|It is only acceptable to test human medicines on human beings if they give their consent.
784| Animal testing|conclusion|Alternatives are being used.
784| Animal testing|premise|Alternatives are being used in place of animal testing when it is possible.
785| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing appropriate when there are no alternatives.
785| Animal testing|premise|Coalition for Medical Progress, a UK-based pro-animal testing group.
786| Animal testing|conclusion|Alternatives cannot replace animal testing for certain objectives.
786| Animal testing|premise|Cells and other surrogates cannot be used in the case of behavioral experiments (psychiatry etc.
787| Animal testing|conclusion|Cells and other surrogates cannot be used in the case of behavioral experiments .
787| Animal testing|premise|Cells don't have tissue and organs.
788| Animal testing|conclusion|There are adequate alternatives to animal experimentation.
788| Animal testing|premise|There are plenty of alternatives to animal experimentation for achieving the desired end of aiding humans and fighting human suffering.
790| Animal testing|conclusion|Alternatives are not being used when it is not practical, which is wrong.
790| Animal testing|premise|The main reason why many alternatives to animal testing are not being used is that they are impractical or too costly; it is not because alternatives do not exist.
791| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing actually helps in testing whether products are environmentally friendly.
791| Animal testing|premise|"""No organisation can commission animal testing without being sensitive to understandable concerns about the issue in society."
792| Animal testing|conclusion|Preventing animal testing is beneficial to the environment.
792| Animal testing|premise|"""9."
793| Animal testing|conclusion|Legislation is already protecting animals from cruel treatment.
793| Animal testing|premise|This rules ensure that animal research is carried out in an ethical manner.
794| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal suffering in experiments can be minimized.
794| Animal testing|premise|Although in principle it is more important to reduce human suffering than to prevent animal suffering, in practice it is possible (and absolutely right) to keep animal suffering to an absolute minimum.
795| Animal testing|conclusion|Many experimental animals are killed before they have a chance to suffer.
795| Animal testing|premise|If animal testing were to be outlawed it would be impossible to attain the significant knowledge that is necessary to eliminate the suffering and premature deaths of humans.
796| Animal testing|conclusion|Tested animals are treated humanely.
796| Animal testing|premise|Animal testers are often instructed to treat their animals like their own pets.
797| Animal testing|conclusion|Testers have an incentive to take care of animals for experiments.
797| Animal testing|premise|The abuse or neglect of animal test subjects does the researcher no good, as any results from an animal who has been kept in less-than-ideal conditions may well contaminate or even negate information obtained through an experiment.
798| Animal testing|conclusion|Strict controls have not prevented researchers from abusing animals.
798| Animal testing|premise|In practice, as everyone knows, animals are not routinely treated well by animal experimenters.
800| Animal testing|conclusion|The genetic modification of animals need only be well regulated.
800| Animal testing|premise|There are indeed new issues raised by the advent of genetic engineering and 'transgenic' animals; these, like all animal experiments should be closely monitored so as to minimise animal suffering.
801| Animal testing|conclusion|The creation of genetically modified animals for testing in immoral.
801| Animal testing|premise|The advent of genetic technologies has made possible all sorts of new and horrific acts of animal exploitation, from cloning sheep to creating mutant and hybrid creatures with no dignity or quality of life at all.
802| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal trafficking of animals can be better regulated.
802| Animal testing|premise|While it may be true that animal testing has created an international demand for animals that can be used in laboratories, and that this has led to some illicit trading, there are many measures that can be taken to stop such illicit trade.
803| Animal testing|conclusion|Animal testing creates a high demand for animals and depletes populations.
803| Animal testing|premise|Animals used by laboratories for testing purposes are largely supplied by dealers who specialize in the trade.
804| Animal testing|conclusion|The Food and Drug Administration approves of animal testing in the case of cosmetics.
804| Animal testing|premise|"""The FD&C Act does not specifically require the use of animals in testing cosmetics for safety, nor does the Act subject cosmetics to FDA premarket approval."
805| Animal testing|conclusion|Cosmetics testing on animals is not required by govts.
805| Animal testing|premise|In Defense of Animals.
806| Animal testing|conclusion|Cosmetic testing on eyes is faulty.
806| Animal testing|premise|Humans can easily determine that a chemical is bad for the eyes simply by studying the pure chemistry involved, rather than putting an animal through intense pain and discomfort.
807| Animal testing|conclusion|Researchers often repeat animal tests only to maintaining funding.

853| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law merely enforces existing law.
853| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""we already have plenty of federal immigration laws on the books, and the typical illegal alien is guilty of breaking many of them."
854| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona has every right to fight illegal immigration.
854| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"Arizona Governor Jan Brewer said at the bill-signing: ""Border-related violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state."
855| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law awkward, but necessary.
855| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""I agree that there's something ugly about the police asking citizens for their 'papers."
856| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Fear-mongering surrounding Arizona law is unjustified.
856| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The law, badly needed to fight the vicious foreign-born crime epidemic that illegal immigration nurtures in Arizona, bears little resemblance to the fear-mongering claims of the law’s opponents."
857| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona illegal immigration law is indecent & mean-spirited.
857| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""Arizona's draconian new immigration law is an abomination -- racist, arbitrary, oppressive, mean-spirited, unjust."
858| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law creates a class of suspects.
858| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""This law creates a suspect class, based in part on ethnicity, considered guilty until they prove themselves innocent."
859| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law creates environment of fear and recrimination.

860| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Singer Linda Ronstadt.
861| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|"Arizona cops will justly apply ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegals."
861| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|""" Over the past four decades, federal courts have issued hundreds of opinions defining those two words."
862| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Cops will trump up charges in order to find illegals.
862| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The amended law limits such inquiries to instances when cops make a lawful stop, detention or arrest in the course of enforcing some other law or local ordinance."
863| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona merely enforces law that aliens carry papers.
863| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""As far as the so-called ""show me your papers law,"" federal law has long dictated that every alien, 18 years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession proof of alien registration."
864| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Being forced to show papers in Arizona is no big deal.
864| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The downside is that some people — citizens, visitors, immigrants and foreign workers — legally in the state may be inconvenienced if asked to identify themselves or show their immigration documents."
865| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Nothing to worry about as long as you have papers.
865| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Carrying papers is no more inconvenient than carrying a drivers license or any other form of ID.
866| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law burdens immigrants who must carry papers.
866| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Alessandra Soler Meetze, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arizona: “If this law were implemented, citizens would effectively have to carry ‘their papers’ at all times to avoid arrest.
867| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law does not allow for racial profiling.
867| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The law will allow police to engage in racial profiling."
868| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|"""Reasonable suspicion"" in Arizona will lead to racial profiling."
868| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""When she signed this law, Gov."
869| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law will harass, jail Latinos without papers on them.
869| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""Arizona is a state of about 6."
870| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law partly driven by racism.
870| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""It’s a scary piece of legislation that will invite racial profiling."
871| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law allows suing of police, encourages racial profiling.
871| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""the provision allowing people to sue officials for not enforcing the law is red meat intended to hound police agencies to boost their arrest numbers."
872| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona does not deport illegals, it encourages self-deportation.
872| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The law, which GOP Gov."
873| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law is reasonable, measured response to illegal immigration.
873| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""In sum, the Arizona law hardly creates a police state."
874| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law would strain federal govt with deportations.
874| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""if states unilaterally start arresting undocumented aliens and dispatching them to the federal government for deportation, they will force the federal government to expend law enforcement resources on immigration when it might have other, more pressing, concerns such as, say, terrorism."
875| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law will increase lawsuits and costs.
875| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The government of Arizona, it turns out, has been ambushed by its own legislature."
876| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law helps deter illegal immigrants.
876| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""such proactive enforcement has a continuing deterrent effect, as violators realize they cannot indefinitely avoid law enforcement contact."
877| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law encourages illegal immigration.
877| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Although conventional wisdom presumes that a prohibitory law will have the desired effect, careful studies of law often show the opposite effect: the behavior they are supposed to inhibit actually increases.
878| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|The new immigration law will decrease crime rates in Arizona.
878| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Illegal immigrants are often, although not always, involved in other crimes, particularly drug-trafficking.
879| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law represents a much needed step away from anarchy.
879| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|In general, the absence of the enforcement of immigration laws in Arizona creates a sense of anarchy in the state, and a certain feeling among criminals that they can commit crimes without concern for punishment.
880| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law causes distrust of police, undermines enforcement.
880| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""One of the concrete problems with the law treating undocumented immigrants as criminals is that it gives those without papers a powerful incentive to stay as far away from police as possible."
881| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law puts police under contradicting missions.
881| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"Joel Jacobsen, assistant attorney general, criminal appeals division for New Mexico: ""This obviously puts police in an impossible situation because it requires them to pursue two goals simultaneously: to enforce the immigration laws; and to enforce the criminal laws, keep the peace, provide assistance, and all the other ordinary tasks of police officers."
882| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona has right to fight illegal immigration without federal authorization.
882| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|""" While it is true that Washington holds primary authority in immigration, the Supreme Court since 1976 has recognized that states may enact laws to discourage illegal immigration without being pre-empted by federal law."
883| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|States, local govts are best at fighting illegal immigration.
883| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|State and local governments are the closest to the problem, and the most capable of designing targeted approaches for their particular illegal immigration problem, which may very in type and severity from state to state.
884| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|10th amendment supports state rights to craft immigration law.
884| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|The Tenth Amendment preserves the traditional police powers of the states to control their own jurisdictions.
885| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona's immigration law is good test case for nation.
885| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""Arizona's law might give the nation information about whether judicious enforcement discourages illegality."
886| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona should not make immigration law.
886| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""TAKE BACK IMMIGRATION POLICY The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that states cannot make their own immigration laws."
887| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Protecting our borders is a purely federal function.
887| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""Protecting our borders is in fact a singularly federal function; reflecting the fundamental responsibility of the national government to protect our sovereignty."
888| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Government protection  is a const. right.
888| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Governments are required by their Constitutions to protect their citizens from crime and foreign threats.
889| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law constitutional.
889| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The law is clearly within the boundaries of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution."
890| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law violates the Fourth Amendment.
890| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."
891| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law will return jobs back to the American people.
891| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""The wide array of statistics available from government and private sector sources leads to this conclusion: Unemployment disproportionately hits unskilled, uneducated blacks and native-born Hispanics."
892| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona law will lessen the financial burden caused by illegal aliens.
892| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Arizona currently has at least 500,000 illegal aliens on the ground, costing the state $1.
893| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law causes parents to send students elsewhere.
893| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""We have already begun to feel an impact from SB1070."
894| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law will damage local economy.
894| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"According to Judge Andrew Napolitano: ""She's also gonna bankrupt her state, because no insurance company will provide coverage for this."
895| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Illegal immigrants in Arizona pose threat to security.
895| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""Obviously, some find it easier to cry out that Arizona's action is unfair and mean-spirited."
896| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Illegal immigrants do not pose a threat to national security.
896| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Largely the result of both push and pull factors, illegal immigrants come to the United States in search of jobs and opportunities, religious freedom, and political freedom, and to escape poverty, persecution, or political corruption/instability.
897| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law merely enforces existing laws.
897| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|Rich Lowry of the National: “Arizona seeks only to enforce the nominal immigration policy of the United States.
898| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Aliens going out without documents has been a crime for decades.
898| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""it's been a federal crime for more than half a century for immigrants to go without documentation."
899| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|The law draws parallels to the old Jim Crow Laws of the South.
899| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"The Arizona law forces police to ask alleged illegal immigrants for their papers if ""reasonable suspicion"" exists."
900| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Arizona immigration law undermines civil rights movement.
900| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"Juan Carlos Ruiz, director of the Latino Foundation of Greater Washington: ""Fifty years in fighting the civil rights efforts that we have put to ensure that all Americans, all people in this country, are free."
901| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Most Americans support Arizona's immigration law.
901| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|An April 2010 poll by Rasmussen, showed 55 percent of Americans supported the tough Arizona law, while 36 percent opposed it.
902| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Roughly 70% of Arizonans support the state's immigration law.
902| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|This has been seen in a number of polls, and demonstrates a particularly high level of support for an aggressive approach in Arizona.
903| Arizona illegal immigration law|conclusion|Support for Arizona's law is understandable, but misguided.
903| Arizona illegal immigration law|premise|"""That 70 percent of Arizonans support the measure is no surprise."
904| Armed pilots in airplanes|conclusion|Arming pilots is the only certain way to defend a cockpit.
904| Armed pilots in airplanes|premise|"""Currently there is no surefire method of defending the cockpit from a team of terrorists on a plane over the North Atlantic, three hours from any airport."
905| Armed pilots in airplanes|conclusion|Guns would be kept in safe boxes, preventing pilot abuse.
905| Armed pilots in airplanes|premise|"""Although pilots would technically be designated as federal law enforcement officers, they would not be authorized carry their guns in ordinary holsters as every other law enforcement officer does, but only in special locked boxes to be kept in the cockpit during flight."
906| Armed pilots in airplanes|conclusion|It's better to arm pilots and risk abuse than risk another 9/11.
906| Armed pilots in airplanes|premise|"""the airline executives would rather risk another 9/11 than take the (tiny) chance that an armed pilot might use his gun illegally, and the airline might be sued."
907| Armed pilots in airplanes|conclusion|Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge.
907| Armed pilots in airplanes|premise|"""I don't think we want to equip our pilots with firearms."
908| Armed pilots in airplanes|conclusion|Gun-training for pilots would be easy.
908| Armed pilots in airplanes|premise|"""It should be remembered that an armed pilot resisting a hijacking faces a much simpler scenario than a typical defensive shooting by an FBI agent, a police officer, or a citizen with a concealed handgun permit."
909| Armed pilots in airplanes|conclusion|No other weapon is as effective as a gun.
909| Armed pilots in airplanes|premise|Martial arts show us that knives and pepper sprays are not a good alternative, as they can easily be snatched by the aggressor and used against their original owners.
911| Armed police|conclusion|Arming the police is an effective deterrent.
911| Armed police|premise|Routinely arming the police is an effective deterrent to criminal behaviour; most countries in Europe and North America routinely arm police officers, in part to deter criminal acts.
912| Armed police|conclusion|Routinely arming the police causes a spiral of violence.
912| Armed police|premise|Where the police are not routinely armed, a proportion of criminals will not arm themselves (since, for example, armed robbery often carries a higher sentence than robbery).
927| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriages prevents people from marriages based solely on physical passion.
927| Arranged marriage|premise|When marriages are arranged,many factors are taken into consideration before contemplating a match between two people,such as up-bringing, monetary equality, background, spiritual beliefs, and tradition and culture.
928| Arranged marriage|conclusion|In arranged marriages, couples more possibly learn to love over time than leaving love entirely to chance.
928| Arranged marriage|premise|In love marriages, couples have the advantage that they fall in love with each other before the marriages.
929| Arranged marriage|conclusion|The success of the couple being a fit is as good as flipping a coin.
929| Arranged marriage|premise|Where love, personality traits and compatibility, respect and honour for each other are given secondary importance in the initial stages, there is higher risk of breakage of something that is rooted on them.
930| Arranged marriage|conclusion|In hinduism and Asian communities the system of arranged marriage originated mainly as the tool of the upper caste people to protect their community and to maintain their social status.
930| Arranged marriage|premise|These people wanted their children to marry someone from the same caste and the same social background.
931| Arranged marriage|conclusion|One of the social evil associated with arranged marriage is dowry in the modern Indian and conservative Asian society.
931| Arranged marriage|premise|In most part of the country arranged marriage is the best medium to take dowry.
933| Arranged marriage|conclusion|There is often emotional pressure or even emotional blackmail.
933| Arranged marriage|premise|Parents beseech their children to agree to a proposal before they die or make use of other emotional pressures and dilemma.
934| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranging marriages is an insult to the very nature of marriage, which should be about creating a loving and lasting partnership and family.
934| Arranged marriage|premise|It reduces a central part of what is fundamentally a religious ceremony (and every religion, including Islam, guarantees choice) to a commercial transaction and therefore undermines family values.
935| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriages are very much ‘real’ marriages.
935| Arranged marriage|premise|Vastly more marriages than not in human history would fall under any sensible definition of arrangement.
936| Arranged marriage|conclusion|It's an overgeneralization and unfair to claim arranged marriages reduce a religious/legal ceremony to a commercial transaction.
936| Arranged marriage|premise|While it is valid that some arranged marriages have problems, sometimes related to finances, it would be a mistake to assume such problems do not occur in dating marriage systems.
937| Arranged marriage|conclusion|How can love be measured.
937| Arranged marriage|premise|Will government officials go door to door and have a clear way of measuring if there is love in an arranged marriage? Love is a complex human emotion, that involves more than lust and sexual access.
938| Arranged marriage|conclusion|A relationship is not treated lightly.
938| Arranged marriage|premise|Whereas in the dating system, a relationship is emphasized as an experiment, with marriage being the end result of a successful trial period, in arranged marriages, the marriage is the start of a relationship, a commitment of two people responsibly loving one another and building a family.
939| Arranged marriage|conclusion|People should have a choice about marriage systems.
939| Arranged marriage|premise|It is quite possible for people to have a choice of what type of general marriage system they want to be a part of (dating or arranged or both), and they should have the freedom of developing within or between those systems in whatever way deemed appropriate for their relationship.
940| Arranged marriage|conclusion|A way how to marry for shy persona.
940| Arranged marriage|premise|For socially disconnected, inept and/or shy persona, arranged marriage may be the only way how to actually marry.
941| Arranged marriage|conclusion|To allow arranged marriages leads to unacceptable pressure on those involved.
941| Arranged marriage|premise|They are often reliant on the parents who wish them to take part in arranged marriages for their futures as well as their current welfare.
942| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriages do involve choice.
942| Arranged marriage|premise|The difference is merely that whole families are involved together in both considering the best options and in helping to achieve what is wanted.
943| Arranged marriage|conclusion|The practice of arranged marriage separates communities, helping to stop integration and encourage distrust between communities.
943| Arranged marriage|premise|This applies largely where it occurs among immigrant populations and helps to maintain a language barrier and an associated cultural ghettoisation.
944| Arranged marriage|conclusion|It is not just groups practising arranged marriage who maintain cohesive communities.
944| Arranged marriage|premise|Afro-Caribbean and Jewish people in Western Europe both maintain a distinct cultural life while taking part fully in the life of this country.
945| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Cultural ghettoisation does not stem from the practice of arranged marriage, but from the history of immigration and boundaries between older communities and new immigrants.
945| Arranged marriage|premise|Class, race, language, and often the prevailing cultural norms and ruling practices of the older community are also to blame.
946| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriage is bad both for the individual women concerned and for women generally in society.
946| Arranged marriage|premise|In the former case this is because they are very vulnerable.
947| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriages in Europe and North America have idiosyncratically low levels of abuse and marital violence.
947| Arranged marriage|premise|The institution of marriage always creates interdependence and therefore scope for abuse and danger and the police and outsiders always find it more difficult to intervene where violence is within a marriage.
948| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriages are mistaken as demeaning women.
948| Arranged marriage|premise|"Both men and women are ""arranged"" or in some systems, ""assisted"" in their marriage to one another."
949| Arranged marriage|conclusion|There is no casual link between a marriage system and domestic abuse.
949| Arranged marriage|premise|"Domestic abuse occurs all over the world, in relationships from various marriage systems and even in relationships where there is no ""official"" marriage."
950| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriage provides a cover for illegal immigration.
950| Arranged marriage|premise|Arranged marriage has a value in use for illegal immigration.
952| Arranged marriage|conclusion|The cause of illegal immigration is not arranged marriages.
952| Arranged marriage|premise|Illegal immigration is often motivated by the want for a better life using underhanded methods.
953| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Arranged marriage is not a true ‘cultural value’ that is in some sense inviolate.
953| Arranged marriage|premise|Every major religion including Islam guarantees the legitimacy of freedom of choice in marriage.
954| Arranged marriage|conclusion|Both young and old people affirm the fact that arranged marriage is a cultural tradition.
954| Arranged marriage|premise|And any ethnographic data confirms it, not to mention the frequency of arrangement throughout the world.
955| Arranged marriage|conclusion|The matter may be of cultural freedom or multicultural freedom.
955| Arranged marriage|premise|Even within any ethnic community there is variety and difference.

961| Artificial life|conclusion|Humans engineered organisms for centuries.
961| Artificial life|premise|In a BBC interview, the Nobel prize-winning geneticist Paul Nurse cast doubt on whether synthetic life will add much to current capabilities, pointing out that we already have powerful means to engineer organisms.
962| Artificial life|conclusion|Potential benefits of synthetic life far outweigh risks.
962| Artificial life|premise|Craig Venter said to the BBC in May of 2010: “Most people are in agreement that there is a slight increase in the potential for harm but there’s an exponential increase in the potential benefit to society.

966| Artificial life|premise|"""The dangers of making organisms that have never before existed (which already happens every day in biotech laboratories) will always be largely unknowable in advance."
967| Artificial life|conclusion|Man-made life poses unimaginable risks.
967| Artificial life|premise|"""Have scientists got too big for their boots? Will their hubris bring Nemesis in due course? What horrors will come creeping out of the flask on the laboratory bench?  Such questions are not misplaced—and should give pause even to those, including this newspaper, who normally embrace advances in science with enthusiasm."
968| Artificial life|conclusion|Risks of artificial life could outweigh benefits.
968| Artificial life|premise|"""The potential is huge - but so are the dangers."
969| Artificial life|conclusion|Artificial life risky if released into environment.
969| Artificial life|premise|"Laura Hake, professor of biology, Boston College, Jesuit Research University, said on BBC: ""I think that the synthetic cell that has just been created is a very exciting basic science breakthrough."

971| Artificial life|conclusion|Threat of bio-terrorism is no greater than natural threats.
971| Artificial life|premise|"While the threat of bio-terrorism ""may be significant,"" according to Ken MacLeod in the Guardian, it's ""not in principle greater than those posed by natural organisms"" that already exist."
972| Artificial life|conclusion|Any scientific advance can be abused.
972| Artificial life|premise|"""While it is true that every new process in the physical as in the biological sciences may lead to unanticipated, potentially harmful novelties, it is also the case that, in the end, any scientific advance can potentially be abused for ill as well as used for good."
973| Artificial life|conclusion|More good synthetic biologists can outwit malevolent ones.
973| Artificial life|premise|"""Thoughtful observers of synthetic biology favour a different approach: openness."
974| Artificial life|conclusion|Artificial life presents risk of bioterrorism.
974| Artificial life|premise|"Jim Thomas, a member of the Etc Group: ""We know that lab-created life-forms can escape and become biological weapons, and that their use threatens existing natural biodiversity."

998| ASEAN, abolition of|premise|though Burma has problem with the regime.
999| ASEAN, abolition of|conclusion|Myanmar is more likely to improve its behavior as a member of ASEAN.
999| ASEAN, abolition of|premise|Prospects for improving the specific human rights problems in Myanmar/Burma – and for offending regimes in the region more generally – are better if the country is included and given incentives to improve, than if it is excluded and left as a pariah state.

1014| Assassination of a Dictator|premise|In that time not only will many more people suffer under a repressive system, but the policies pursued by an out-of-touch and unrepresentative regime are likely to do serious (if unintentional) harm to the whole nation and its economy, making eventual rebuilding much more costly in both human and economic terms.
1015| Assassination of a Dictator|conclusion|Assassination can counter-productively rally citizens around a regime.
1015| Assassination of a Dictator|premise|Assassination is likely to be counter-productive, rallying popular feeling around a repressive regime as external enemies or internal minorities are blamed, rightly or wrongly, for the act.
1016| Assassination of a Dictator|conclusion|To liberalize a regime, there are better ways than assassination.

1020| Assassination of a Dictator|premise|The argument that much evil can be prevented by such action is highly questionable.
1021| Assassination of a Dictator|conclusion|Moral absolutes exist.
1021| Assassination of a Dictator|premise|If we assume the role of executioner without the backing of law we are sinking down to the level of the dictators.

1023| Assassination of a Dictator|premise|The right to life is inviolable.
1024| Assassination of a Dictator|conclusion|Dictators are a threat to international peace, not just their own people.

1033| Assassination of a Dictator|premise|By what prerogative would the USA feel itself best placed to decide which democratically elected national leaders should be assassinated? Presumably, such a decision would be based entirely on ideological grounds (as far as the media and the publicj were concerned) and economic grounds (as far as the politicians and their corporate bosses were concerned).

1122| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia can be appropriate when a person is no longer themselves.
1122| Assisted suicide|premise|The most sacred element of a person is their identity as individual and a soul.
1123| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Life is an intrinsic good that cannot be traded in to end suffering.
1123| Assisted suicide|premise|The future which lies ahead for the terminally ill is of course terrifying, but society’s role is to help them live their lives as well as they can.

1139| Assisted suicide|premise|A good doctor will form close bonds with their patients, and will want to give them the best quality of life they can.
1140| Assisted suicide|conclusion|If an individual doctor opposes euthanasia, another one can perform the procedure.
1140| Assisted suicide|premise|There is no necessity to force any given doctor into performing euthanasia.
1141| Assisted suicide|conclusion|The first promise of the Hippocratic oath is to never euthanize patients.
1141| Assisted suicide|premise|"The relevant portion of the Hippocratic oath reads, ""I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone."
1142| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia contradicts the physicians fundamental role as healer.
1142| Assisted suicide|premise|The physician has always acted as healer.
1143| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Physicians can never be obligated to facilitate euthanasia.
1143| Assisted suicide|premise|Some suggest that physicians have an obligation to end the suffering of patients by subjecting them to euthanasia.
1144| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia violates the guiding principle of medical ethics is to do no harm.
1144| Assisted suicide|premise|a physician must not be involved in deliberately harming their patient.
1145| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Legalizing euthanasia places an unreasonable burden on doctors.
1145| Assisted suicide|premise|The daily decisions made in order to preserve life can be difficult enough; to require them to also carry the immense moral responsibility of deciding who can and cannot die, and the further responsibility of actually killing patients, is unacceptable.
1146| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia helps families that don't want to see their loved one suffer.
1146| Assisted suicide|premise|As was mentioned above, euthanasia is an immediate and painless way to end a life that is too painful.
1147| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia is a family decision, not a state decision.
1147| Assisted suicide|premise|"Charlie Crist, former Attorney General of Florida and current governor, was quoted in an April 20, 2006 article in the AZ Republican, entitled ""Attorney General Says Bush Had Schiavo Case Wrong"" - ""I am pro-life and I respect life."
1148| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Most people that believe euthanasia is wrong never sat by a bed side.
1148| Assisted suicide|premise|"Some advocates of euthanasia note that those that have come out of a ""bed-side"" death very frequently become advocates of euthanasia."
1149| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Legalizing euthanasia would allow more open family dialogue on the choice.
1149| Assisted suicide|premise|Where euthanasia is currently illegal, it is a lonely, desperate act, carried out in secrecy and often as a cry for help.
1150| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Families will abuse euthanasia merely to reduce family strains.
1150| Assisted suicide|premise|Families often have a direct interest in seeing an ill family member die.
1151| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Family members may oppose the decision of a loved one to be euthanized.
1151| Assisted suicide|premise|Many may resent a loved one’s decision to die, and would be either emotionally scared or estranged by the prospect of being in any way involved with their death.
1152| Assisted suicide|conclusion|The ill will feel pressure to seek euthanasia to avoid burdening family.
1152| Assisted suicide|premise|The dying have a profound sense of shame and guilt, being in the condition that they are, and causing their family substantial burdens and strains.
1153| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia will not create a slippery slope to legal murder.
1153| Assisted suicide|premise|R.
1154| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia abuses are less likely if practice is brought into open.
1154| Assisted suicide|premise|It is common when a practice is criminalized that it is taken into the shadows and performed without regulation and, subsequently, abusively.
1155| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Eligibility for euthanasia requires that patients meet strict criteria.
1155| Assisted suicide|premise|The criteria involved in the proposals to legalize euthanasia are very detailed and would be enforced very strictly.
1156| Assisted suicide|conclusion|History does not suggest doctors coerce patients into euthanasia.
1156| Assisted suicide|premise|There is very little historical evidence of doctors actually coercing patients into accepting euthanasia against their will.
1157| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia creates a slippery slope to legal murder.
1157| Assisted suicide|premise|Wesley Smith, J.
1158| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Dutch doctors have abused legal euthanasia in their country.
1158| Assisted suicide|premise|"Richard Fenigsen, ""Dutch euthanasia revisited, "" Issues in Law & Medicine, Winter 1997 v13 n3 p301-311 - ""Dr."
1159| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Difficult to ensure assisted suicide is voluntary.
1159| Assisted suicide|premise|"""3."
1160| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia will desensitize public to idea of killing to solve problems.
1160| Assisted suicide|premise|Euthanasia will give the impression that it is OK to kill or to commit suicide when faced with a problem.
1161| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Disabled would have to seek euthanasia in order to receive it.
1161| Assisted suicide|premise|The argument that the legalization of euthanasia will increase deaths of disabled by euthanasia is premised on the faulty notion that the government and doctors are actually forcing euthanasia on people.
1162| Assisted suicide|conclusion|"Denying the disabled the ""right to die"" will cause them painful deaths."
1162| Assisted suicide|premise|As mentioned before, everyone has a right to end their pain.
1163| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia threatens vulnerable disabled groups.
1163| Assisted suicide|premise|Robert Burgdorf Jr.
1164| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Poor people that can't afford health care won't then seek euthanasia.
1164| Assisted suicide|premise|Opponents of Euthanasia sometimes argue that the poor are vulnerable in the event of the legalization of Euthanasia because they can't afford health care, and so will seek euthanasia instead.
1165| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Hospitals won't re-focus resources on euthanizing the disadvantaged.
1165| Assisted suicide|premise|In Compassion in Dying v.
1166| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia is mainly utilized by non-vulnerable, well-educated groups.
1166| Assisted suicide|premise|Death With Dignity National Center.
1167| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia threatens the vulnerable poor.
1167| Assisted suicide|premise|"""2."
1168| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Assisted suicide increases interest in improving end-of-life care.
1168| Assisted suicide|premise|Barbara Coombs Lee, J.
1169| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia can only be performed after exhausting palliative options.
1169| Assisted suicide|premise|"This obviously means that there is no ""either/or"" situation involved with euthanasia."
1170| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia option can disincentivize sound end-of-life palliative care.
1170| Assisted suicide|premise|Physicians for Compassionate Care.
1171| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia is not fundamentally driven by a desire to cut costs.
1171| Assisted suicide|premise|While it is true that a correlation appears to exist in the interests of for-profit health-care companies and euthanasia, this does not mean that the drive for euthanasia is at all driven by these cynical considerations.
1172| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia would reduce health care costs.
1172| Assisted suicide|premise|While this is, again, not a driving consideration behind euthanasia, it is true that euthanasia could reduce health care costs.
1173| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia is driven by a cynical desire to cut health care costs.
1173| Assisted suicide|premise|Rita Marker, J.
1174| Assisted suicide|conclusion|Euthanasia would not cut health care costs by very much.
1174| Assisted suicide|premise|Ezekiel Emanuel, M.
1175| Atheism|conclusion|Reality and the laws of nature are independent of man and faith.
1175| Atheism|premise|A tree is a tree, a table is a table - A is A.
1176| Atheism|conclusion|If you believe in God, then you reject reason.
1176| Atheism|premise|Reason is man's only means of survival.
1177| Atheism|conclusion|All victors unfortunately believe that God is on their side.
1177| Atheism|premise|Another fallacy, which should be understood by those who advocate an omnipotent, omniscient, mystical father figure, who contradicts every law of nature, and who destroys mans mind by faking reality, should note this: a person achieves, he thanks god.
1178| Atheism|conclusion|Religious Dogma provides a Haven for Social Ignorance.
1178| Atheism|premise|Even assuming the theological premises of religion are valid, the epistemological basis for divine gnosis, cannot be communicated free of interpretation and bias.
1179| Atheism|conclusion|We no longer need God.
1179| Atheism|premise|Once we needed gods or deities to explain our world and to give us some hope of purpose.
1180| Atheism|conclusion|Religion gives people something outside of themselves to live for.
1180| Atheism|premise|Morals and right and wrong come directly from religion.
1181| Atheism|conclusion|Regarding the atheists’ premise “If you believe in God, then you reject reason.
1181| Atheism|premise|The author fails to provide evidence for this statement, and daily life and common sense both show that this is not a sound statement.
1182| Atheism|conclusion|Religious Dogma provides a Repository for Social Wisdom.
1182| Atheism|premise|"Even if one assumes the foundational theological premises of religions are false, competing religious beliefs about proper personal and social behavior acts as a social ""genetic code""."
1183| Atheism|conclusion|Whether God exists or not, it is clear that mankind desperately needs him.
1183| Atheism|premise|This is because of our easily corruptible nature- which history has shown.
1184| Atheism|conclusion|People who believe in God do not do so because they want to be lazy.
1184| Atheism|premise|"The Bible itself denounces laziness, especially in Proverbs and also Paul says ""If a man shall not work he shall not eat."
1185| Atheism|conclusion|Religious institutions are a major driver of war.
1185| Atheism|premise|That may be true but religion all around has caused some of the most high death tolling wars in history such as the crusades.
1186| Atheism|conclusion|Problems of religious institutions favors, by default, atheism.
1186| Atheism|premise|If religious institutions have some inherent flaws, certainly this favors atheism on many levels as an alternative.
1187| Atheism|conclusion|Communism has nothing to do with atheism.
1187| Atheism|premise|Communism is the perfect form of government in a perfect society.
1188| Atheism|conclusion|Communism is very closely linked to Atheism.
1188| Atheism|premise|"There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Communism ""was invented by atheistic idealists who wanted a perfect society without God's help."
1189| Atheism|conclusion|Atheists have also had wars.
1189| Atheism|premise|The claims in this section are a mish-mash of irrelevancies.
1191| Atheism|conclusion|The claim that the Nazi government was repressive of religion.
1191| Atheism|premise|"which it unquestionally did with regard to the holocaust, ignores the fact that the majority of Nazis were Catholics, that the Catholic church collaborated with the Nazi state to the extent of organising the escape of defeated Nazis to South America, that Hitler and the Nazis regularly (even if they did not actually personally believe it themselves) claimed that they were acting in accordance with God's will and with his blessing - the belt worn by non-SS soldiers had upon it ""Gott mit uns"" (""God with us""), and many senior Nazis endorsed some form of paganism."
1192| Atheism|conclusion|Religion has helped people better themselves and world.
1192| Atheism|premise|Religious Institutions have helped many people do things they otherwise could have not such as quit smoking, stop drinking alcohol, and help many convicted felons turn a new leaf.
1193| Atheism|conclusion|Acts of religious institutions are irrelevant to faith and atheism.
1193| Atheism|premise|The actions and beliefs of religious institutions are irrelevant to the debate of whether or not Atheism is a sound philosophy, as well as to the issue of evidence for or against God.
1194| Atheism|conclusion|Just because some wars have happened in the name of religion does not mean that all people who follow the religion can be tarnished by the same brush.
1194| Atheism|premise|The crusades which the atheists have mentioned in this debate were started by the Catholic church in an age when they were notorious for their corruption.
1195| Atheism|conclusion|When atheists criticise religions for the largely negative impact atheism has had on society, they are overlooking their own negative impact.
1195| Atheism|premise|Communism, the ideology providing the ground for so many brutal dictatorships throughout the last century, was mainly followed by atheists.
1196| Atheism|conclusion|Communism is very closely linked to Atheism.
1196| Atheism|premise|It was invented by atheistic idealists who wanted a perfect society without God's help.
1197| Atheism|conclusion|"Atheists criticise religious people for evangelising and ""attempting to convert people"", however, they do the same."
1197| Atheism|premise|In Communist prisons many Christians were subjected to vigorous brainwashing with the intent of killing their faith, and many were also tortured in other ways.
1198| Atheism|conclusion|Atheists have also had wars.
1198| Atheism|premise|Take the Second World War, which was caused partly by Hitler's belief that the Germans were superior, a result of his belief in Evolution.
1199| Atheism|conclusion|All humans are imperfect.
1199| Atheism|premise|Just because you believe in a just God doesn't mean you are automatically expected to be perfect.
1200| Attorney-Client Privilege|conclusion|Attorney-client privilege upholds justice by improving legal access.
1200| Attorney-Client Privilege|premise|Convictions can result from lack of access to legal advice.
1201| Attorney-Client Privilege|conclusion|Attorney-client privilege obstructs justice.
1201| Attorney-Client Privilege|premise|In criminal cases ‘justice’ fundamentally demands two things: that the guilty are convicted, and, even more importantly, that the innocent are acquitted.
1202| Attorney-Client Privilege|conclusion|Without attorney-client privilege, people would not tell their lawyers anything.
1202| Attorney-Client Privilege|premise|Even if a defendant is willing to seek legal advice, in the absence of the privilege they will be reluctant to be completely honest with their lawyers, for fear that what they say may be used against them later.
1203| Attorney-Client Privilege|conclusion|Attorney-client privilege does not cause clients to divulge all information.
1203| Attorney-Client Privilege|premise|Clients frequently withold information from their lawyers because they worry that a lawyer will not ‘try his best’ if the lawyer thought they were guilty or that they were ‘bad people’.
1204| Attorney-Client Privilege|conclusion|Rules of law should not be designed to protect the guilty.
1204| Attorney-Client Privilege|premise|And it is worth noting that the attorney-client privilege often protects, and is the most valuable to one particular group - the guilty.
1207| Attorney-Client Privilege|conclusion|The predictability in the application of the privilege protection is critical to its effectiveness and success.
1207| Attorney-Client Privilege|premise|Openness and candour by the client can only be encouraged if the client knows that his communications with legal counsel are, and will remain, confidential and protected.
1208| Attorney-Client Privilege|conclusion|An higher judicial willingness to remove the privilege may damage compliance.
1208| Attorney-Client Privilege|premise|Fear of compulsory disclosure may deter candid, careful, detailed, written advice being given by lawyers to their clients.
1210| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia's history on Britain is irrelevant, Australia has a unique identity.
1210| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Australia no longer is dependent on England and there is no need to be part of the Commonwealth.
1211| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Australian monarch is, in fact, a foreign monarch.
1211| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Supporters of the monarchy often argue that the Queen is not a foreign queen, but ""our queen"", and thus Australian."
1212| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Foreign monarchs cannot adequately represent Australians.
1212| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|A central argument made by Australian republicans is that, as Australia is an independent country, it is inappropriate for the same person to be both the head of state of more than one country.
1213| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The queen represents British not Australian interests abroad.
1213| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|When the queen travels abroad, she focuses almost all of her energies on representing Britain's interests.
1214| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Ending the monarchy would foster an independent identity in Australia.
1214| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The monarchy is a direct reflection of Australia's past as a British colony and continues to symbolize Australia's subservience to the British crown.
1215| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia could actually remain in the commonwealth as a republic.
1215| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Establishing a republic does not necessarily mean leaving the commonwealth.
1216| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia was founded by the Crown and so owes continued allegiances in the commonwealth.
1216| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The first European settlers in Australia were from England, arriving in the 1780s between the American and French revolutionary wars.
1217| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The commonwealth is a sound community for Australia even in modernity.
1217| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The commonwealth has its place, even in modernity.
1218| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australians can vote to exit the commonwealth, but have chosen to remain.
1218| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Australians have chosen to remain within the commonwealth.
1219| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Queen is not a foreign queen, but is the Queen of Australia.
1219| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""The title, role and legal aspects of the Queen of Australia are not well understood by most Australians including those who advocate a republic and by most of those employed within the media industry."
1220| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The governor-general is an Australian head of state.
1220| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Republicans make the argument that the monarchy needs to be abolished in order to secure an Australian head of state.
1221| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|"The Australian monarchy is ""broken"" in so far as it is undemocratic."
1221| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"In modernity, the degree to which a government is ""undemocratic"" is, in large part, the degree to which it can be considered ""broken""."
1222| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|"That the Australian monarchy ""works"" is a faulty argument against positive change."
1222| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"The argument that Australia's government ""isn't broken, so why fix it"", is what is known as a status quo argument."
1223| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|"The monarchy might ""work"", but it is inappropriate and wrong."
1223| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|That something works does not make it right.
1224| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Republicanism is not more modern than constitutional monarchy.
1224| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Constitutional monarchies exist in some of the most developed societies on earth.
1225| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|If the Australian constitutional monarchy isn't broke, don't fix it.
1225| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Pragmatic monarchists have maintained that, whatever the argued weaknesses of the current system, it also had many strengths; following the motto of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""."
1226| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Queen has never abused her power in Australia.
1226| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|If the British Queen Elizabeth II violated the trust of Australians and abused her power despotically, perhaps there would be a major claim against the status quo.
1227| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia should perfect its democracy by becoming a republic.
1227| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Any system that relies on hereditary appointment instead of elections is, inherently, undemocratic.
1228| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|"A ""crowned republic"" in Australia is not an adequate republic."
1228| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""Australia is a ""Crowned Republic"" anyway."
1229| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Monarchy undermines democratic development in Australia.
1229| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Adam Wynn said, ""It is inconsistent if not hypocritical to try to instill in people an appreciation of democratic ideals, when our own head of state is the epitome of the exact opposite""."
1230| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Monarchies risk bringing completely incapable people to power.
1230| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Monarchies, and their hereditary processes, can bring a child, mentally disabled, or plainly despotic person to power.
1231| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Desires for republic grow with increasingly democratic Australians.
1231| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""Since a change in national consciousness has engendered a much greater focus on inclusionary policies that reflect the social conditions of the 1990s, the Australian constitution becomes increasingly out of date."
1232| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The monarchy checks the abuse of power by the executive.
1232| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""Today the monarchy represents the denial of total power."
1233| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia is already a republic.
1233| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Australia is not a monarchy.
1234| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The governor-general represents all Australians.
1234| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|With an elected head of state, a very large percentage of a national population find themselves being led by a person they did not vote for.
1235| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australians democratically chose a constitutional monarchy.
1235| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Having chosen to establish a constitutional monarchy in 1901, Australians cannot now complain.
1236| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australian republicans are making a blatant power grab.
1236| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|This isn't about democracy.
1237| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Reforming a constitution should be extremely exceptional in a democracy.
1237| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Constitutions are supposed to enshrine the rights of a country's citizens permanently.
1238| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia's monarchic system is equally democratic as Britain's.
1238| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Britain's constitutional monarchy is a model democracy.
1239| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The symbolism of the Australian monarchy is important and bad.
1239| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Some say that the Monarchy only has symbolic meaning, as a way to disclaim the significance of the monarchy and thus reduce the significance of the complaints raised against it.
1240| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The monarchy symbolizes principles Australians don't agree with.
1240| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Modern Australians are worldly people whom do not agree with antiquated notions associated with the crown, such as hereditary power, royal dignity, male primogeniture, Anglican church supremacy, and other forms of elitism associated with the crown.
1241| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Australian monarchy symbolizes a history of tyranny.
1241| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The British monarchy has a history of tyranny and imperial exploitation as much as democracy and the law.
1242| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The monarchy is not actually a model family for Australians.
1242| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The royal family in Britain has not actually been a model of honor, dignity, and honesty.
1243| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|An Australian republic will not mean rejecting the English heritage.
1243| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The English heritage need not be rejected by establishing a republic.
1244| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Seeking an Australian republic does not disrespect the queen.
1244| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Many commonwealth countries are ""crown republics""."
1245| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Monarchy symbolizes all that Australia inherited from Britain.
1245| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, wrote in August, 2007, ""the Union Flag to remind us that we have inherited precious traditions of parliamentary democracy, faith, law and language."
1246| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The monarchy inspires justice, honor, and duty in Australia.
1246| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The monarchy has a long history of justice, honor, and duty.
1247| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Queen has served, united, and uplifted Australians.
1247| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The Queen has had a particularly beneficial role in Australian society since taking power in 1947.
1248| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Many modern states like Australia have foreign elements in identity.
1248| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""The very idea of the monarchy offends people accustomed to think in aggressive slogans."
1249| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Australian Monarchy is just a symbol.
1249| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The British queen and monarch are not endowed with very much power in Australia.
1250| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Republicanism is disrespectful to the queen.
1250| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Most Australians have a deep respect for the Queen.
1252| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia's monarchy is not really politically neutral.
1252| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|the claim that the Monarch is politically neutral is not completely true.
1253| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Australian monarchy is not necessary for national security post Cold War.
1253| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Supporters of the monarchy often argue that preserving the monarchy is necessary in upholding Australian national security.
1254| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Arguing that republicanism is divisive is a status quo argument.
1254| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""Republicanism is a divisive issue."
1255| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Australian monarchy provides a non-political check on the political process.
1255| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Monarchists claim that the succession of an apolitical head of state provides a far more stable constitutional system compared to one involving appointing or electing a president who is likely to have a political agenda.
1256| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|A partisan head of state in a republic can be problematic.
1256| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Many Australians distrust the Australian political classes and believe the provision of executive powers to a local politician would result in an undesirably partisan head of state, and subsequent instability.
1258| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Republicanism in Australia incites tensions between Protestants and Catholics.
1258| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|It has also been claimed monarchism and republicanism in Australia delineate historical and persistent sectarian tensions with, broadly speaking, Catholics more likely to be republicans and Protestants more likely to be monarchists.
1259| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Conducting a constitutional referendum in Australia would not be difficult.
1259| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Refferendums are easy to conduct, it's a little bit like voting at an election.
1260| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Drafting a Republican constitution in Australia would not be difficult.
1260| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|A Republican Constitution is too difficult to draft Conservative lawyers such as Sir Harry Gibbs have made fuss of the difficultly of drafting a set of words for a Republic constitution which would recreate the balances and political stability enjoyed by Australia under the present arrangements.
1261| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|An Australian republic could accommodate states that remain monarchies.
1261| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""What about the Australian States? If the Commonwealth became a Republic it wouldn't matter in the interim if the States wanted to remain monarchies."
1263| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Creating a republic would require dramatically re-writing Australia's constitution.
1263| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|This is based on the notion that changing a constitutional monarchy to a republic demands much more than simply changing a couple of words in the constitution; it requires almost entirely re-writing it.
1264| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Harder in a republic to expel abusive executive.
1264| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""This is another subtle little check and balance that would not be available in a republic."
1265| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Establishing a republic would be costly to Australians.
1265| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""The Queen costs the Australian taxpayer nothing at all until she visits this country with her staff, and then costs the Australian taxpayer only their combined accomodation and travel expenses."
1266| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australia cannot force states to accept a republic.
1266| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""Regardless of this, one State Attorney (a Republican) has commented that States which refuse must be forced to change to a Republic - comments which remind one of the war of words which ended in the American Civil War."
1267| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Passing Australian republic constitutional referendum too difficult.
1267| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Sir Robert Menzies' words, ""to get an affirmative vote from the Australian people on a referendum proposal is one of the labours of Hercules."
1268| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|A referendum on an Australian republic could cause a constitutional crisis if rejected by states.
1268| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|If a referendum is held and passes, a constitutional change would then have to be approved by the states.
1269| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Better not to rush a republic in Australia.
1269| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said on April 20th, 2008, ""I regard it as inevitable."
1270| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Republic a bad idea before Queen Elizabeth II leaves Aus.
1270| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told Network Ten.
1271| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|All the coins would have to be changed.
1271| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|If Australia was to suddenly drop out of the Commonwealth, all the coins with the picture of the Queen and the $5 (with the Queen on it) would need to be changed.
1273| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Establishing a republic in Australia is inevitable.
1273| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Australia is trending toward greater democracy and a reduced role for antiquity institutions such as the monarchy.
1274| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australian republicanism is a diversion from other pressing issues.
1274| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Republicanism in Australia is primarily about symbolism as opposed to the real problems facing Australia.
1275| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australian republicanism should be dealt with in the future.
1275| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Even if there are good reasons to adopt a Republican form of government in Australia, now is not the time.
1276| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The monarchy violates Australian laws against gender discrimination.
1276| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Succession to the British throne is based upon male primogeniture, in which male heirs take precedence and the right of succession belongs to the eldest son.
1277| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Queen Elizabeth II's existence undermines claims against a sexist Australian monarchy.
1277| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|While an issue can be made over primogeniture, it is somewhat odd that opponents of the monarchy claim that the monarchy is sexist when Queen Elizabeth II, a woman, has been Queen for over sixty years.
1278| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The Australian monarchy violates the separation of church and state.
1278| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|Under the Act of Settlement, passed by the British Parliament in 1701, the monarch is prohibited from either being Catholic, or from marrying a Catholic.
1279| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The monarchy poses no real threat to secularism in Australia.
1279| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|The principle of separating church and state was designed to protect freedom of belief from a tyrannical state.
1280| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australian constitution does not separate of church and state.
1280| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|While many argue that the monarchy in Australia is unconstitutional due to its connection with the Anglican Church, this erroneously assumes that the constitution states a separation of Church and state.
1281| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|"The principal of ""neutrality"" between Church and State is justified."
1281| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"The Constitution calls for ""neutrality"" between state institutions and religion."
1282| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The 1999 referendum was rejected on specifics not the principle of Republicanism.
1282| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|It was the particular form of the republic offered which was criticised as the main reasion for the defeat of the referendum.
1283| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The 2020 summit on 19-20 April, 2008 agreed with a republic system.
1283| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|On 19-20 April, in Canberra, a 2020 summit was held where Australians gave ideas to the Prime Minister.
1285| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Support for Australian republic has waned in recent years.
1285| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"""Still, there is some reason to think that long-standing attachments and traditional loyalties have not entirely lost their appeal."
1286| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|The 1999 Republic referendum was voted down in Australia.
1286| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"In this referendum, roughly 55% of the nation voted ""no"" and all states voted ""no""."
1288| Australian republic vs. monarchy|conclusion|Australian republic favored by inner-city elites.
1288| Australian republic vs. monarchy|premise|"Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy convenor David Flint said, ""It's something that is clung to very much by the inner-city elites."
1289| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|Flying is a major contributor to global warming, warranting a tax.
1289| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Airplane engines generate a significant amount of Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide biproduct.
1290| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|The extent of the damage compared to other uses of fossil fuels is still uncertain.
1290| Taxation of international aviation|premise|However the industry, led by the  is making considerable progress towards reducing emissions.
1291| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|Taxing aviation fuel would encourage greater fuel economy by making kerosene more expensive.
1291| Taxation of international aviation|premise|As the popularity of air travel continues to increase rapidly, it is important to put pressure on the aviation industry to use fuel as efficiently as possible so as to hold emissions down as much as possible.
1292| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|Airlines already have a price incentive to maximize fuel efficiency, so a tax on fuel is unnecessary.
1292| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Fuel is a major cost item for all airlines and as prices of fossil fuels have soared over the past few years, so it has put pressure on airlines to change their practices and adopt new technology in order to survive.
1293| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|Air travel has other negative impacts on the environment, beyond its contribution to climate change.
1293| Taxation of international aviation|premise|The rapid increase in flights over the past two decades has led to increased local air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion (and vehicle emissions) around airports, and the loss of land to new runways and terminal buildings.
1294| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|Taxing aviation fuel would have a dangerous economic impact on airlines.
1294| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Airline companies have very high fixed costs (hugely expensive fleets of aircraft, large and well-paid staff, landing fees, etc.
1297| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|A tax on aviation would be international in scale and provides an excellent opportunity to raise money for development aid.
1297| Taxation of international aviation|premise|The EU is considering such a plan as a way of providing additional funding to make sure its Millennium Development Goals targets will be met.
1298| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|Unless a tax on aviation was so high that it damaged the airline industry, it is unlikely to meet the need for development aid.
1298| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Countries have already made commitments to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and they should be prepared to meet their promises out of their domestic budgets, rather than experiment with a untested gimmick.
1299| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|A tax on aviation fuel could certainly be put into effect on an international basis.
1299| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Climate change is a global problem and the ICAO was tasked in the Kyoto Protocol to look at how the aviation industry worldwide could reduce emissions.
1300| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|An international tax on aviation fuel would be impractical and impossible to put into action.
1300| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Attempts to place a tax on fuel by individual states will fail, as airlines can easily obtain fuel more cheaply elsewhere.
1301| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|See following debates for further expansion on question.
1301| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Carbon Emissions: Market vs.
1304| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|Emissions trading has many problems.
1304| Taxation of international aviation|premise|Unlike other solutions it does not raise any revenue for development aid - one of the main advantages of a global aviation tax.
1305| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|A charge to airplane travelers would do economic harm to the industry and particularly affect poorer travelers.
1305| Taxation of international aviation|premise|It also suffers from the problems of using aviation money to fund development aid outlined in point 5 above.
1306| Taxation of international aviation|conclusion|An alternative way of taxing aviation would be to place a charge upon aeroplane tickets.
1306| Taxation of international aviation|premise|An international tax on ticket sales could raise a great deal of money for the developing world (see point 5 above) while still limiting the increase in flights.
1307| A right to die?|conclusion|Of course there exists the right to live.
1307| A right to die?|premise|That means that the cost of one's life is the oneself, not the other ones.
1308| A right to die?|conclusion|People are free to commit suicide as it only harms them.
1308| A right to die?|premise|As a general principle, individuals should be free to commit any act that only affects themselves, does not directly harm other citizens, and that does not damage to their surrounding environment.
1309| A right to die?|conclusion|Decision to commit suicide does not demonstrate insanity.
1309| A right to die?|premise|"""there isn't any good evidence that mental illness by any generally accepted definition is usually involved in a person's decision to commit suicide."
1310| A right to die?|conclusion|Suicide violates the value society places on life.
1310| A right to die?|premise|There are certain things that society must value as inviolable.
1311| A right to die?|conclusion|Die with dignity, abandon the word euthanasia.
1311| A right to die?|premise|"""Every person shall have the right to die with dignity; this right shall include the right to choose the time of one's death and to receive medical and pharmaceutical assistance to die painlessly."
1312| A right to die?|conclusion|Prescribing lethal drugs is violation of the doctor's healing role.
1312| A right to die?|premise|"""Doctors themselves are divided on the issue."
1324| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos are not just companies.
1324| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""The ideological hard-liners have now cast their collectively jaundiced eye on Detroit’s automakers."
1325| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US auto bailout is better than the more costly alternatives.
1325| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""The frustrating part about auto executives' presumptuous attitude toward a taxpayer bailout is that they are probably right -- they are too big to failhere's the problem: a collapse of the domestic auto industry will cost the public much more than a short-term bailout."
1326| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US govt. is responsible for protecting communities with auto bailout.
1326| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""why, many people are asking, must the American taxpayer once again pay to subsidize companies that just couldn’t compete? Should Congress fail to act decisively and support the auto industry in its time of need, whole towns in the Midwest will become ghost towns."
1327| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Class bias influenced reluctance to help Detroit.
1327| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""It has happened repeatedly in the last several weeks -- well-paid, well-known journalists questioning the wisdom of 'bailing out Detroit,' of helping an industry whose union-represented workers have substantially better wages and benefits than other manual or skilled laborers, or, more precisely, who are better compensated than their nonunion counterparts working at foreign-owned rival companies building cars and trucks in the United States."
1328| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|If US automakers fail, foreign autos will raise prices.
1328| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Prices? When the home team goes down, watch those foreigners push up their car prices."
1329| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout is investment in future tax revenues from US autos.
1329| Bailout of US automakers|premise|By sustaining the automakers, a bailout will sustain government revenues from the automakers.
1330| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout of US autos wrongly intervenes in marketplace.
1330| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Not so long ago, corporate giants with names like PanAm, ITT and Montgomery Ward roamed the earth."
1331| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US can rely entirely on foreign automakers in global economy.
1331| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""When the current economic crisis passes – and it will as all other crises have in the past – Americans will still want cars, trucks, and maybe SUVs to drive."
1332| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US auto bailout would damage global free trade.
1332| Bailout of US automakers|premise|By showing heavy favoritism for domestic auto suppliers, the US would cause other foreign governments to become increasingly protectionist, damaging free trade and the broader global environment for foreign direct investment.
1333| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Auto bailout could diminish US assets and dollar.
1333| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""America runs the risk of creating the kind of ""political-risk premium"" that investors have long placed on other countries -- and that would reduce demand for U."
1334| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Automaker bailout unfairly disadvantages competition.
1334| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Aside from the cost to taxpayers, a government safety net for companies discourages prudent management."
1335| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Taxpayer dollars should not be used to bailout auto companies.
1335| Bailout of US automakers|premise|The bailout of the auto industry merely transfers wealth from taxpayers to auto companies and their employees.
1336| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Recent failure of autos does not justify letting them die.
1336| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""It’s easy to demonize the American auto industry."
1337| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos are productive and viable, should be kept alive.
1337| Bailout of US automakers|premise|US automakers Ford, GM, and Chrysler are all fundamentally productive companies, despite having some poor management and strategic planning in recent years.
1338| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Auto bailout protects great cars just now coming out.
1338| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""They’ve got good stuff coming — if they live to bring it out."
1339| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US bailout can force needed changes on automakers.
1339| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""At the moment, Washington has tremendous leverage over the failing auto industry."
1340| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US has successfully aided autos before.
1340| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Washington has successfully propped up the auto industry before."
1341| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Withholding bailout is not necessary to US auto restructuring.
1341| Bailout of US automakers|premise|It is wrong to assume that the only way to incentivize the US automotive giants to reform is by withholding a federal bailout or low-interest loan program.
1342| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout cannot prevent inevitable collapse of US autos.
1342| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""It makes no sense at all to give these companies billions just so they can struggle on for a few more months down this disastrous paththere is no guarantee that these companies will survive after years of failed management."
1343| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Autos will not restructure if US bails them out.
1343| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""IF General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye."
1344| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout with strings attached will not help autos compete.
1344| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""To dampen criticism, Congressional Democrats speak of a bailout “with strings attached."
1345| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Past US auto bailouts only fostered dependencies.
1345| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""A One of the examples I'm hearing from proponents of the current bailout is, ""Let's go back to 1979 when Chrysler was bailed out."
1346| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout would diminish global market for US autos.
1346| Bailout of US automakers|premise|By showing significant favoritism, a US autos bailout would increase global auto protectionism and make it harder for US auto companies to find global markets for their products, which is exactly what they need to do to compete and survive.
1347| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Failure of US autos would devastate US economy.
1347| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""If one of these companies is forced into bankruptcy, the other two are almost certain to follow, resulting in massive layoffs and plant closures, a hit to the incomes of millions of retirees and another body blow to wounded banks and credit markets that have lent the Big Three hundreds of billions of dollars."
1348| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos may never get out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
1348| Bailout of US automakers|premise|More significantly, Chapter 11 proceedings for GM would be far more complicated than that of a retailer, or of Lehman Brothers.
1349| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Consumers would not buy cars from bankrupted automakers.
1349| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Some arrant nonsense has been spoken and written about letting the Detroit Three slip into bankruptcy in order to restructure."
1350| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bankruptcy is not best way to turnaround autos.
1350| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""is a Chapter 11 filing the best way to reach these goals of reforming of the autos? Answering yes presumes that the case would be resolved quickly, that the entities would be able to obtain ample debtor-in-possession financing, that parties with legitimate legal claims on the company's assets and cash flows would give them up willingly."
1351| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout deters car buyers as much as bankruptcy would.
1351| Bailout of US automakers|premise|People have claimed that Americans wouldn't buy from a company that declared bankruptcy.
1352| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Chapter 11 bankruptcy will help autos restructure and regroup.
1352| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""The United States created Chapter 11 precisely to help companies that need protection from their creditors while they restructure their liabilities and winnow out the good business from the bad."
1353| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Chapter 11 bankruptcy may not deter car consumers.
1353| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""The carmakers retort that being in Chapter 11 will poison their business."
1354| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Chrysler and GM should declare bankruptcy and merge.
1354| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Should the government bail out the U."
1355| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Saving economy outweighs moral hazard of auto bailout.
1355| Bailout of US automakers|premise|Not only are the Big Three not deserving, but to help them out of their current predicament would also set a lousy precedent in a market-driven economy where the possibility of earning great wealth is supposed to be balanced against the possibility of failure And yet it is probably the wise thing to do.
1356| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Autos are exceptional.
1356| Bailout of US automakers|premise|Opponents argued that a bailout will set a precedent that will cause other companies to seek bailouts for their financial difficulties.
1358| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Auto bailout will encourage other companies to seek bailouts.
1358| Bailout of US automakers|premise|If the auto industry is given aid, other industries and companies will have a good case for seeking aid as well, and will take advantage of the opportunity.
1359| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Auto bailout encourages special-interest deal-making.
1359| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""When politicians grant special favors to a certain industry or a particular union, such decisions necessarily mean that market forces are being replaced by special-interest deal-making."
1360| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos are as deserving of bailout as Wall Street.
1360| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""while the White House has indicated its reluctance to involve the government in the rescue of yet another industry, it may have a hard time explaining why the automakers are any less deserving of a ""bailout"" than Wall Street investment banks or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."
1361| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Financial bailout was far more important than auto aid.
1361| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""This is a different sort of endeavor than the $750 billion bailout of Wall Street."
1362| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US carmakers have been making the transition to efficient cars.
1362| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""It's not only politicians who are perpetuating the myth that Detroit just discovered the world has changed  The facts suggest something different."
1363| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos didn't build green cars because Americans wouldn't buy them.
1363| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""They didn’t build green cars,"" you say? Well, we wanted pickups and SUVS."
1364| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Financial crisis is to blame for much of US auto collapse.
1364| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Automakers have been hit hard by a collapse in consumer spending triggered by the U."
1365| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Unexpected oil prices share blame for auto failures.
1365| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""It is easy to list the lame decisions that brought Detroit to its knees  True, they did this to themselves, but not entirely."
1366| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Poor US trade protection contributed to auto collapse.
1366| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Washington caused part of the problem by letting Japan manipulate its currency so it could sell cars cheap here."
1367| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US consumers are partly responsible for failed autos.
1367| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""many of us contributed indirectly to the automakers' financial woes by choosing ""foreign"" vehicles -- a choice influenced by a perception, warranted or not, that Japanese and European cars are better than their American counterparts."
1368| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos forgot product development.
1368| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""On the product side, management demonstrated an egregious failure of leadership by never envisioning the day when SUVS and big trucks would fall out of favor."
1369| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos shirked fuel standards, don't deserve bailout.
1369| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Detroit’s problems are mostly of its own makingThe automakers hitched their fate to gas-guzzling trucks, and they obstinately refused to acknowledge that oil is a finite resource and that burning it limitlessly is harming the planet."
1370| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Blame for auto failures is on management, not outside factors.
1370| Bailout of US automakers|premise|There are many successful car companies in the world today that have had to deal with the same factors facing the Detroit automakers.
1371| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Public opinion is against an auto bailout.
1371| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Survey shows that Americans think federal aid for the Big Three is unfair and won't help the economy."
1372| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos have already significantly cut labor costs.
1372| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Newsweek commentator Robert Samuelson writes that back-breaking contracts with the United Auto Workers make the Big Three uncompetitive."
1373| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US auto labor wages not to blame for automaker's failures.
1373| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""It’s not about union wages, CAW economist Jim Stanford said."
1375| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US autos have failed to control labor cost.
1375| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""I have several prescriptions for Detroit’s automakers."
1376| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout would be wasted on auto unions.
1376| Bailout of US automakers|premise|Bailout may be entirely wasted on paying exorbitant employee benefits.
1377| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Autos are seeking a government loan not a bailout.
1377| Bailout of US automakers|premise|Jim Seta, a worker for supplier SKF.
1378| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US should make low interest loans to automakers.
1378| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""the best of a set of bad options might be for the government to step in and provide the Big Three with low-interest long-term loans, just as it did years ago with Lockheed and Chrysler."
1379| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Low-interest loans to automakers will not solve their problems.
1379| Bailout of US automakers|premise|The automobile makers have greater problems than a simple lack of liquidity.
1380| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Low-interest loans are just another liability for car-makers.
1380| Bailout of US automakers|premise|While there are some advantages to low-interest loans, the fundamental problem is the same; it adds another liability on-top of existing liabilities for the US automakers to have to deal with.
1381| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US government should nationalize US automakers.
1381| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Congress is poised to enact a massive taxpayer bailout of GM, Chrysler, and Ford."
1382| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Nationalization of US automakers would increase US debt.
1382| Bailout of US automakers|premise|The US debt is already absurdly high.
1383| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Nationalization of US autos wrongly advances socialism in the US.
1383| Bailout of US automakers|premise|The US is already leaning toward socialism significantly with its major $700 billion bailout.
1384| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Auto companies key to US energy security.
1384| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""why not just let General Motors, Chrysler and Ford go under? As the governor of Michigan, the home of the U."
1385| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Auto companies are key to US military during war.
1385| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"The chief executive for Chrysler LLC, Robert Nardelli, told the Senate on Tuesday that crippling the auto industry ""would undermine our nation's ability to respond to military challenges and would threaten our national security."
1386| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|US automakers no longer essential to US security.
1386| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""Desperate for a $25 billion government rescue package, U."
1387| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout will preserve place of autos in American identity.
1387| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""You know something? Maybe we’ll lend them money and they won’t make it anyway."
1388| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Automakers are not fundamental to American identity.
1388| Bailout of US automakers|premise|"""what is an American car? I drive a Chrysler PT Cruiser."
1389| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Buying from foreign car companies supports American workers.
1389| Bailout of US automakers|premise|If you want to buy an American-made car, go buy a Toyota or Volkswagon, or BMW.
1390| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout allows US autos to produce needed green cars.

1391| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Bailout of autos will take money from green economy.
1391| Bailout of US automakers|premise|Bailout of autos will take money away from the green economy in the sense that it will make it more difficult for the government to subsidize and invest in the emerging green economy.
1392| Bailout of US automakers|conclusion|Non-American automakers are better suppliers of green cars.
1392| Bailout of US automakers|premise|Foreign automakers have been much better at producing fuel efficient vehicles than US automakers.

1401| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|premise|"""Our Constitution outlines in the broadest terms how the federal system works."
1402| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|conclusion|Amend would create Const. crisis, court battle with each budget.
1402| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|premise|"""Since arguments over whether a budget is truly and honestly balanced are endless, a constitutional requirement of balance would make resolving the argument the province of the federal court system, raising two critical problems."

1404| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|premise|"""Any federal balanced-budget amendment should allow the government to spend more than it collects in taxes during wars and recessions, with the understanding that it will spend less during peaceful times of plenty."
1405| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|conclusion|Reducing spending with BBA frees-up money for job-creation.
1405| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|premise|"""For some reason we have developed a huge blind spot in our public policy discourse that blocks out the fact that every single dollar that government spends has first been extracted from the private sector."
1406| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|conclusion|Spending limits creates certainty for job creation.
1406| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|premise|"Ohio Republican John Boehner said that adoption of a balanced budget amendment would help ensure ""that spending restraints are set in stone, and the certainty it provides will help create a better environment for job creation across the country."

1414| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|conclusion|States need fed to be able to run deficit to back-them up.
1414| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|premise|If states have a balanced budget amendment, they often fall victim to a number of circumstances which makes it necessary for them to seek Federal backing (in which case it is important for the fed to be able to borrow in order to support them).
1415| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|conclusion|Balanced budget amend in states is often a bad thing.
1415| Balanced budget amendment to US Constitution|premise|The fact that some states have balanced budget amendments often means that, during hard times when tax revenues are low, states have to dramatically cut spending.

1445| Banning cell phones in cars|premise|driving without due care and attention is a limited charge that can be very difficult to prove.
1446| Banning cell phones in cars|conclusion|Cell phone ban is unnecessary.
1446| Banning cell phones in cars|premise|This means that if someone is driving dangerously through inappropriate use of their mobile phone, then the police can already prosecute them.
1447| Banning cell phones in cars|conclusion|New laws would be enforceable, as billing records will show whether a phone was in use at the time.

1468| Banning child performers|conclusion|If children are working or performing they are not spending their time in formal education.
1468| Banning child performers|premise|Regardless of what kind of work they are doing this deprives them of something so important that we make it compulsory for all children.
1469| Banning child performers|conclusion|"A bit of work and performance is important for children in giving them a taste of ""real life"" early on."
1469| Banning child performers|premise|In the end, education is designed to prepare children for their adult lives and careers.
1470| Banning child performers|conclusion|Children are less able to make decisions for themselves and to represent their interests.
1470| Banning child performers|premise|This leaves them at risk of exploitation in the workplace.
1471| Banning child performers|conclusion|Banning child performance will not prevent the possibility of exploitation.
1471| Banning child performers|premise|At the moment, child performers are official employees and as such their pay, hours and conditions are all monitored by government departments (i.
1472| Banning child performers|conclusion|Stage fright and the pressure of performance can be difficult to handle for even the most experienced adults.
1472| Banning child performers|premise|It is therefore irresponsible to place these pressures on children at anything but the lowest amateur level.
1473| Banning child performers|conclusion|Children feel pressure to succeed in many fields, not simply in performances.
1473| Banning child performers|premise|They feel pressure to succeed at an early age in exams, on the school football beach or singing a solo in the choir’s Christmas concert.
1474| Banning child performers|conclusion|Young bodies are not well protected against the rigors of regular physical training.
1474| Banning child performers|premise|Children’s bones are softer than adults and therefore more prone to stress fractures and disfiguration.
1475| Banning child performers|conclusion|Children's bodies can be damaged by many forms of physical performance.
1475| Banning child performers|premise|Just as certain scripts call for the casting of children, particular tricks require long light bodies to perform.
1476| Banning child performers|conclusion|Allowing children to perform pushes them to grow up too soon.
1476| Banning child performers|premise|They are exposed to levels of responsibility, sexuality and temptation (e.
1477| Banning child performers|conclusion|Children have had to mature rapidly for ages.
1477| Banning child performers|premise|Modern attitudes to children are a recent cultural development; for centuries children had to go out to work and were treated as adults from a much younger age than today.
1478| Banning child performers|conclusion|The consequences of such a ban need not be severe.
1478| Banning child performers|premise|Young adult actors often portray children on stage and in films or television.
1479| Banning child performers|conclusion|The wider consequences of a ban on child performers will be severe.
1479| Banning child performers|premise|Some sports, such as gymnastics, tennis and ice-skating may collapse without appropriate early training regimes.
1480| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Religious freedom has limits.
1480| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Religious freedom has some obvious limits.
1481| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Head scarves are not fundamental to Muslims expressing their faith.
1481| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Head scarves are not an essential element of the Islamic faith and the connection between believers and their God.
1482| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves upholds equal treatment and opportunity.
1482| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Many societies are founded on secular values that do not permit the sponsorship of any religion by the state.
1483| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Muslim women opposition to veils is not adequately represented.
1483| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""It is largely Muslim men who are insisting that ""their"" girls and young women will be upset, concerned or made fearful by the banning of the hijab from public schools."
1484| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|A head scarf ban violates the right to freedom of religion and expression.
1484| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in 2004: ""The proposed law is an unwarranted infringement on the right to religious practice."
1485| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Wearing head scarves is unlike religious extremes such as stonings.
1485| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""In justifying the former, Rumy makes the error of rolling together the headscarf issue with religious practices that socialists unequivocally call for the banning of: such as death by stoning for sex outside marriage or clitoridectomySuch practices are clearly examples of savage and cruel religious oppression and are imposed on the women involved."
1486| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Wearing head scarves does no harm and violates nobody's rights.
1486| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""Under international law, states can only limit religious practices when there is a compelling public safety reason, when the manifestation of religious beliefs would impinge on the rights of others, or when it serves a legitimate educational function (such as prohibiting practices that preclude student-teacher interaction)."
1487| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Wearing the Hijab is protected by religious freedom under UN Charter.
1487| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|The right to freedom of religion is enshrined in the UN charter and considered by many to be a basic human right.
1488| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Public bans on head scarves encourage private bans.
1488| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|If the government bans the wearing of head scarves in public places, what can possibly prevent private institutions from doing the exact same? The answer is nothing.
1489| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Wearing the Hijab does no harm to other individuals.
1489| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Religious freedom should have no boundaries, except for maiming, killing, hurting, etc.
1490| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|A Muslim head scarf ban is important to preserving state secularism.
1490| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Former French President Jacques Chirac in calling for a ban on head scarves in 2003.
1491| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|A state does not jeopardize its secularism by allowing head scarves.
1491| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""the protection of religious freedom is fully consistent with secularism in state institutions."
1492| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|France is hypocritical in head-scarf-ban secularism.
1492| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""there is something profoundly hypocritical in banning Islamic religious symbols in the name of secularism and gender equality--while the French government continues to subsidize private education for that other globally influential misogynist religion, the Catholic Church, at a higher rate per pupil than public schools."
1507| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning wearing religious symbols makes discrimination more difficult.
1507| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""If we are talking about a star of David, the hand of Fatima or a small cross, those are acceptable, but when it's very obvious, in other words, when if they are worn people can immediately see what religious faith they belong to, that should not be accepted."
1508| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Muslims in the West need to embrace culture/head-scarf-ban.
1508| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Labour's Ruairi Quinn said immigrants who come to Ireland need to conform to the culture of this country.
1509| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Tolerance of head scarves exercises emotional compassion and peace.
1509| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|The Qur’an mentioned the ‘Hijab’ for the women as well as men.
1511| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves is appropriate when along with other religious symbols.
1511| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|France has instituted such a ban on Muslim head scarves, Jewish skullcaps, and large Christian crosses in public schools.
1512| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves is worse than banning other religious symbols.
1512| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|While some defend a ban on Muslim head scarves by pointing to bans on other religious symbols, there are important differences between these symbols.
1513| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning other religious symbols is only a front for targeting Islam.
1513| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""To be sure, the French ban targets not just the hijab, beards and bandanas that denote Islamic affiliation, but also Jewish skullcaps and ""conspicuous"" Christian crosses (the fate of the Sikh turban has yet to be determined)."
1514| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Muslim women are pressured by social conventions to wear the Hijab.
1514| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Pressure comes both socially from wanting to look like other women in their community and religiously from imams and family leaders pressing for observance.
1515| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|"""Choosing"" to wear head scarves merely internalizes oppression."
1515| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""It is true that many Muslim women willingly wear the veil, but even if this is an expression, or assertion of cultural, religious, and racial identity and self-pride, for example, in response to a hostile, racist environment (rigorous research needs to be done as to why exactly Muslim women in the West do this), it is nonetheless tantamount to their internalising their oppression."
1516| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves makes it easier for Muslim women to uncover.
1516| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|When government sets a clear state standard against Muslim head coverings, it becomes much easier for Muslim woman - whom would rather not wear Hijabs but that are pressured to do so - to uncover.
1517| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|A ban violates the rights of women who freely choose to wear veils.
1517| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"How can it be ascertained whether a Muslim women wears a Hijab as an act of individual faith, opposed to in reaction to cultural pressures? It may be impossible to isolate the extent or limitation of ""free choice"" involved in this act, making it impossible to generally claim that the trend of Hijab wearing among Muslim women is culturally imposed, and against free will."
1518| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|The state must allow for parental judgement on head scarves for children.
1518| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""Supporters of the law have also defended the ban on the grounds that it will protect Muslim girls from being forced or pressured to wear the headscarf by their parents."
1519| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Opponents should argue against head scarves, but a ban is excessive.
1519| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|It is legitimate to oppose something.
1520| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Pressure to wear veils is fine.
1520| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Most people are affected by the societal norms surrounding them.
1521| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Muslim head-coverings help keep women safe.
1521| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Muslim women must cover their head and other parts of bodies except palm hand and face (or called aurah or aurat) to avoid any bad things to happen to them and to give protection for them.
1522| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Only the husband has the right to see a woman.
1522| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|It is also the specialties for them when they get married.
1523| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Separation of Church and State demands banning the hijab in public schools.
1523| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""My starting point is that secularism is a fundamental pillar of socialist politics and therefore socialist organisations must have this at the heart of their programmes and campaigns."
1524| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves in schools protects children from being forced.
1524| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""However, even whilst arguing against it, the left should support the right of women to veil themselves."
1525| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Head scarf bans in schools protects children from religious indoctrination.
1525| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|It is unfair for young women to be indoctrinated so early with religious beliefs, particularly the religious doctrines guiding the wearing of the hijab.
1526| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|The Hijab causes problems in schools, such as division and alienation.
1526| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|It is potentially divisive in the classroom, marking some children out as different from the others and above the rules that the school enforces for everyone else.
1527| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Head scarves initiate other forms of oppression in school.
1527| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""It is important to stress that veiling not only acts as a barrier to normal relations between veiled Muslim and non-Muslim girls, it is invariably the precursor to other forms of oppression: the drive to gender segregation, restrictions of veiled girls to partake in physical education, especially swimming, or indulge in dancing etc."
1528| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Head scarf ban in schools deprives Muslim women of right to education.
1528| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose wife and daughters observe the Islamic dress code, was quoted in a 2007 Financial Times article saying: ""The right to higher education cannot be restricted because of what a girl wears."
1529| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Discriminating against Muslim forms of child-indoctrination is wrong.
1529| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|It is wrong to use a ban on Muslim head scarves as a way to discourage Muslim religious indoctrination.
1530| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves in school is an egregious state intrusion.
1530| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""Youth oppression is not only situated within the family."
1531| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves in school won't break oppression.
1531| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""Will banning the headscarf enable those young women who don't want to wear it break free from their oppression? No, since outside of school they will still be obliged to don the headscarf."
1532| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head scarves in school stigmatizes Muslim communities.
1532| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"Dalil Boubakeur, president of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, told Reuters, ""A law on religious symbols in the school environment could stigmatize a whole community."
1533| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Schools make up problems about the hijab as an excuse for intolerance of Muslims.
1533| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|In a multicultural society, students should be aware of the different religious practices and cultural traditions of their classmates, and be taught to understand and respect these.
1534| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Veil-wearing can make it very hard to identify individuals.
1534| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|In the current security climate this poses a problem for many potential terrorist targets like banks, government offices etc.
1535| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|The Hijab disguises key features of an individual more than hats.
1535| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|These forms of decoration do not render impossible identification techniques, whereas a head scarf has this potential.
1536| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Non-Muslim items of clothing conceal features of identity too.
1536| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Many other things, like motorbike helmets, baseball caps and beards can also make identification difficult, yet they are not banned.
1537| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Head scarves are symbols of Muslim militancy.
1537| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""many are equally afraid of the veil as a symbol of rising militancy among Muslim communities."
1538| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Approving of the Hijab approves its fundamentalist principles.
1538| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Approving of Muslim head coverings in society erroneously cements the Hijab as an essential tenet of Islam in the minds of non-Muslims as well as believers.
1539| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning head coverings provokes greater extremes of fundamentalism.
1539| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|Framing laws to ban only Islamic forms of dress could be considered an attack on one religion.
1540| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Banning Muslim head scarves will not cause fundamentalist backlashes.
1540| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""The third major argument against the ban is that there will be an Islamic backlash as this will drive Muslims into the arms of the religious right."
1541| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Allowing head scarves would foster a greater clash of civilizations.
1541| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel warned recently of ""the development of a sort of pseudo-fundamentalist trend which could end up encouraging a miniature clash of civilizations in Belgium."
1542| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Bans on Muslim head scarves cause a backlash from the Muslim community.
1542| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|When Muslims are told that they can't exercise a certain element of their faith, they will revel from their oppressors.
1543| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|Many Muslims hide opposition to veil ban to avoid attacks from non-Muslims.
1543| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|"""The quoted 48 per cent of Muslims in France who are in favour of the ban - even if we take opinion polls as accurate reflections of real feelings - has to be put in the context of this offensive, where standing up to this ban leads to Muslims being branded anti-Republic, anti-French and part of the ""Islamic threat""."
1544| Banning Muslim hijab|conclusion|The French strongly support banning Muslim head scarves.
1544| Banning Muslim hijab|premise|A 2003 poll in France showed 69 percent favor a law banning the wearing of head scarves and other religious symbols.
1545| Banning the confederate flag|conclusion|Confederate flag incites violence.
1545| Banning the confederate flag|premise|Free speech is not always protected.
1546| Banning the confederate flag|conclusion|Bearing the confederate flag is protected by the right to free speech.
1546| Banning the confederate flag|premise|First Amendment rights are being trampled in the name of political correctness.
1547| Banning the confederate flag|conclusion|The confederate flag is associated with racism.
1547| Banning the confederate flag|premise|Many support the viewpoint of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, who hold that it is unreasonable to ask African Americans not to react to someone wearing the rebel flag.
1548| Banning the confederate flag|conclusion|The confederate flag is often used in a historical context.
1548| Banning the confederate flag|premise|"Some people such as in the ku klux klan use it as a hate symbol and fly it to hurt colored peoples feelings where others use it as a symbol of there heritage it means something to them they have black friends the same as whites yet they love the confederate flag its sacred and if they say ""if this flag offends you you need a history lesson"" or ""heritage not hate"" which both mean they dont hate blacks its their heritage and for that it should not be banned."
1554| Banning the confederate flag|conclusion|Schools can ban the confederate flag like gang colors or miniskirts.
1554| Banning the confederate flag|premise|all are disruptive to the school learning environment.
1555| Banning the confederate flag|conclusion|Confederate flag represent pride in one's community.
1555| Banning the confederate flag|premise|This is very different from the other ‘disruptive’ influences identified here.
1558| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Advertising promotes non-rationality.
1558| Ban on advertising|premise|There is nothing moral about encouraging customers to be non-rational and impulsive in spending.
1559| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Advertising manipulates small children.
1559| Ban on advertising|premise|even before they reach the age when they are legally responsible for their actions.
1560| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Advertising exploits our deepest fears, sensitivities and yearning.
1560| Ban on advertising|premise|There is nothing moral about such actions, the less for commercial purposes.
1561| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Advertising creates an attitude of wastefulness.
1561| Ban on advertising|premise|"There is no justification for encouraging the ""psychological obsolescence"" of products currently in use."
1562| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Many adverts are not justifiable on moral basis.
1562| Ban on advertising|premise|There is no justification for promoting products that effectively ruin people's health (cigarettes, alcohol) and cause several millions of deaths annually.
1563| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Advertising leaves everybody better off.
1563| Ban on advertising|premise|"Not only do the consumers benefit from the products they buy thanks to adverts, but also the whole economy benefits from these ""impulsive"" buys, thus leaving everybody better off (both the producers and consumers)."
1566| Ban on advertising|conclusion|The more is produced, the more needs to be consumed.
1566| Ban on advertising|premise|Without advertising, people wouldn't be buying things they do not necessarily need, which would slow the economy down, as economy cannot grow unless people consume.
1567| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Advertising exacerbates imperfect information.
1567| Ban on advertising|premise|Advertising always presents one point of view and thus does not help consumers make more informed decisions, quite the contrary.
1568| Ban on advertising|conclusion|Advertising is a mere distraction, disturbance.
1568| Ban on advertising|premise|Omnipresent advertising merely annoys people, as it effectively destroys beauty of historic centres in cities, distracts drivers (and thus poses a threat to their security), and - for example - takes up space in newspapers (in place of articles).
1569| Ban on advertising|conclusion|There is no way to ban advertising.
1569| Ban on advertising|premise|Taking into consideration that adverts are omnipresent in today's society, it is not feasible to regulate them.
1572| Ban on advertising targeting children|conclusion|Ads cause children to beg for products.
1572| Ban on advertising targeting children|premise|Advertising specifically to children is unethical because they have little or no money of their own and have to persuade their parents to buy the products for them.
1573| Ban on advertising targeting children|conclusion|"Ads for ""must-have"" products alienates children that ""can't have""."
1573| Ban on advertising targeting children|premise|"Advertising which presents products to children as ""must-have"" is also socially divisive, making children whose parents cannot afford them appear inferior, and creating feelings of frustration and inadequacy, as well as leading families into debt."
1574| Ban on advertising targeting children|conclusion|Banning ads shirks the individual responsibility of children and parents.
1574| Ban on advertising targeting children|premise|Advertising has no magical power to create unnatural desires for material possessions.
1575| Ban on advertising targeting children|conclusion|Advertising aimed at children brings negative social consequences.
1575| Ban on advertising targeting children|premise|Much of it is for food and drinks that are very unhealthy.
1576| Ban on advertising targeting children|conclusion|Children naturally like foods that are rich in fats, proteins and sugar.
1576| Ban on advertising targeting children|premise|They give them the energy they need to play energetically and grow healthily.
1578| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Antarctica is a pristine and unspoilt continent of great scientific value.
1578| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|In particular, it has a critical impact on the world's environment and ocean systems.
1579| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Antarctica presents an alternative to a world dominated by political disputes, economic exploitation and environmental destruction, and we should preserve it that way.
1579| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|Placing the southern continent in the care of scientists and out of reach of both politicians and multinational corporations has ensured it can be preserved unchanged for future generations.
1580| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|There is not much worth preserving in Antarctica.
1580| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|Antarctica is huge and almost completely unpopulated - only the coastal fringes have any animals or plants.
1581| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Any negative effects of exploitation would pale in comparison to other negative environmental activities going on around the world.
1581| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|By far the greatest impacts on the Antarctic are external, e.
1582| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|It is inappropriate for a scientific elite to set the agenda in closing off Antarctica, without regard to either economic logic or democratic accountability.
1582| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|If the Antarctic can help to provide additional resources for a rapidly growing world population, then we should be able to have an intelligent debate about the costs and benefits involved.
1583| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|There are many reasons why oil and gas exploration should not be allowed in the Antarctic.
1583| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|Firstly, proven and probable reserves of oil and gas are still rising faster than global consumption, so there is no economic need to exploit any hypothetical Antarctic sources.
1584| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Oil exploration in Antarctica is now feasible, should be allowed.
1584| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|Although current technology would not enable exploitation of any reserves at economic prices, future technological advances and rises in the price of fossil fuels may change this equation.
1585| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Antarctica must be protected from mineral exploitation and the 1991 Protocol upheld.
1585| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|There are no known mineral deposits on the continent, so the argument for exploitation is highly speculative, but it is nonetheless dangerous.
1586| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|The Antarctic Protocol of 1991 should be amended to allow for the possibility of mineral prospecting.
1586| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|The failed CRAMRA Convention of the late 1980s would have allowed for this possibility subject to strict regulation and the agreement of all treaty nations; reasonable conditions which were rejected by environmental purists.
1587| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Fishing is at present allowed under the 1991 Protocol.
1587| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|and has been increasing in recent years as overfishing is exhausting other global fisheries.
1588| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|The Antarctic oceans are underexploited compared to all other fisheries.
1588| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|Quotas for different species are set very low by scientists sticking to very conservative precautionary principles, and could in most cases be greatly expanded without risk of overfishing.
1589| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Access to Antarctica should be restricted to those with a serious scientific purpose.
1589| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|Perhaps 27000 tourists are expected in 2004, mostly on cruise ships which call at Antarctic sites for just a few days, but this number is rising rapidly and some visitors are now undertaking adventurous activities such as ski-hiking, scuba-diving, snowboarding and mountaineering.
1590| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|conclusion|Tourism should be greatly expanded to allow as many people as possible to visit this unique environment.
1590| Ban on Antarctic exploitation|premise|Antarctica should be for all of humanity, not just for an elite few scientists who seek to deny others access while simultaneously demanding huge sums of money for their research projects.
1591| Ban on battlefield lasers|conclusion|Laser-induced blindness is severe and cannot be cured.
1591| Ban on battlefield lasers|premise|It is clearly cruel and any victim who suffers temporary or permanent eye damage will most likely rather have been killed.
1592| Ban on battlefield lasers|conclusion|"However ""cruel"", laser-induced blindness is usually temporary, death is not."
1592| Ban on battlefield lasers|premise|Given that the only other option in stopping the enemy is a bullet in the brain, battlefield lasers are still the lesser of the two evils.
1593| Ban on battlefield lasers|conclusion|Lasers should be banned like blinding gases were banned after WWI.
1593| Ban on battlefield lasers|premise|"""SEVENTY years after the spectre of soldiers blinded by gas during the First World War led to an international ban on chemical weapons, the Red Cross is campaigning for a ban on the use of battlefield lasers to blind the enemy."
1594| Ban on battlefield lasers|conclusion|Lasers are undermining military tactics.
1594| Ban on battlefield lasers|premise|Lasers cause only temporary damage, which means more prisoners will be taken, costing countries more.
1597| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|Political repression under communist rule used to flourish.
1597| Ban on communist parties|premise|Although communist regimes in different countries vary greatly, most of them can be characterized by political processes, executions, nationalization of assests and by other similar actions that failed to uphold basic human rights and freedoms.
1598| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|"""Collective"" ownership is an ill defined concept."
1598| Ban on communist parties|premise|Whatever rhetoric may be used, the fact of ownership of property is having control over the use and disposition of said property.
1599| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|Many could be motivated to work by a wish to aid their fellow man.
1599| Ban on communist parties|premise|Over time, as the benefits of this better way of life become obvious, all will.
1600| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|Democracy cannot and should be protected by banning opinions.
1600| Ban on communist parties|premise|"It is ironic that ""the anti-Communist campaigners say they are acting to defend democracy while working to ban a party that is still doing well in elections""."
1601| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|Communism will destroy the economy.
1601| Ban on communist parties|premise|By restricting the activities of individuals the economy will collapse.
1602| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|"Society can develop a general consensus about what views can pose a ""threat""."
1602| Ban on communist parties|premise|While there are some things society disagrees on, there are other things that we agree on and can establish as norms, standards, and morals.
1603| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|"""Threat"" to society is an overly subjective criteria for the banning of extremist groups from politics."
1603| Ban on communist parties|premise|"What ""threat"" are we talking about? If it violent harm, that is one thing."
1604| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|Banning communist groups will effectively snuff them out.
1604| Ban on communist parties|premise|Their censorship will mean that the vast majority of people in the country never have access to them, even if a small hardcore still do, who are probably converts anyway.
1605| Ban on communist parties|conclusion|"Communist parties may benefit from being banned, as they may be more effective in the ""underground""."
1605| Ban on communist parties|premise|Such parties benefit from going underground.
1606| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|Societies have a right to set moral judgements and standards that exclude extremist groups.
1606| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|We can declare things abhorrent and not justified in decent society.
1607| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|The very strength and weakness of a democracy is in allowing anyone to challenge it and mold it.
1607| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|If the system regulates itself by declaring who cannot challenge it then it is not pure and it is a betrayal of the very system.
1608| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|It is difficult to categorize a party as 'extremist' or 'far-right'.
1608| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|There is a wide difference in policy between groups such the BNP and Front Nationale, and the List Pym Fortuyn.
1609| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|Democracy should never be about banning opinions.
1609| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|"It is ironic that ""the anti-Communist campaigners say they are acting to defend democracy while working to ban a party that is still doing well in elections""."
1610| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|Extremist parties can be banned if they express hate speech that causes harm to other groups.
1610| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|Free speech does not exist in a vacuum: It can be restrained specifically in this case on grounds of harm.
1611| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|"Society can develop a general consensus about what extremist views can be deemed ""harmful""."
1611| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|While there are some things society disagrees on, there are other things that we agree on and can establish as norms, standards, and morals.
1612| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|As long as extremist parties do promote physical harm to others, they should be given freedom to engage in politics.
1612| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|Although politicians in extremist parties may promote intolerance and discriminatory policies, very rarely do they directly call for violent action, so what impact are we seeking to restrain? We already have laws that regulate the conduct of free speech - slander, libel etc.
1613| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|"""Harm"" to society is an overly subjective criteria for the banning of extremist groups from politics."
1613| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|"What ""harm"" are we talking about? If it violent harm, that is one thing."
1614| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|Extremist groups often bring what might be protected in private into the public sphere, which should be restrained.
1614| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|The former is to be preserved, but the latter has an impact on other people, and it is this that we are seeking to restrain.
1615| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|The difference between public and private speech is hard to distinguish, and so extremists should be given more flexibility.
1615| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|Such a difference is misleading and dangerous.
1618| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|Merely by being allowed to advocate their views, extremist parties are given a veneer of respectability.
1618| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|The fact that the vast majority of people disagree is irrelevant.
1619| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|Extremist views need to be defeated in open public debates.
1619| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|No one is disputing the fact that extremist views are repellent.
1620| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|Banning extremist groups will effectively snuff them out.
1620| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|Those that talk of parties going underground with such banning legislation are wrong.
1621| Ban on extremist political parties|conclusion|"Extremist parties may benefit from being banned, as they may be more effective in the ""underground""."
1621| Ban on extremist political parties|premise|Such parties benefit from going underground.
1624| Ban on factory farming|conclusion|The meat produced by factory farming is cheap because it is of very low quality.
1624| Ban on factory farming|premise|It is ‘mechanically recovered’ (i.
1625| Ban on factory farming|conclusion|This intensive type of farming brings meat down to a price affordable to the poorest in our community on a regular basis.
1625| Ban on factory farming|premise|Historically, classes in industrial societies have always been demarcated not only by wealth but also the consequent effect on diet and health.
1626| Ban on factory farming|conclusion|Factory farming is damaging healthier, traditional farming methods that were more in tune with nature.
1626| Ban on factory farming|premise|The countryside as we know and love it was created by traditional farming methods, particularly grazing, not vast sheds full of imprisoned animals fed on imported feed.
1627| Ban on factory farming|conclusion|All forms of farming have always involved the imposition of artificial, man-made patterns on nature.
1627| Ban on factory farming|premise|This is just another part of that.
1628| Ban on factory farming|conclusion|Factory farming sees animals as ‘products,’ ‘commodities’ for production and sale instead of as life forms that deserve a certain respect and good treatment.
1628| Ban on factory farming|premise|But animals are conscious and aware and know pleasure and pain.
1629| Ban on factory farming|conclusion|Animal food products is an industry that retains the right to act efficiently.
1629| Ban on factory farming|premise|Unless the state is going to impose vegetarianism (and that’s not being proposed here) the business of food will continue, and that business should be efficient and productive like any other – that’s in the interest of the producer, who makes a profit, and the consumer, who gets a low price.
1630| Ban on factory farming|conclusion|Large-scale beef farming has significantly added to the damage to the ozone layer, as cows and their manure produce vast quantities of methane.
1630| Ban on factory farming|premise|It also erodes topsoil at an alarming rate.
1631| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Human cloning violates the rights of the child to parents.
1631| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""In the case of reproductive cloning the engendered child would be brought to term and delivered without the benefit of parents since it would carry the genetic code only of the one who had supplied the DNA from his or her somatic cell."
1632| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|While illegal clones should have rights, a ban is still justified.
1632| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""All human cloning—all creation of new human beings by asexual processes—should be legally prohibited."
1633| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Human cloning produces sub-humans without ordinary souls.
1633| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Human cloning produces individuals artificially.
1634| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Scientists want to create a race of clones to experiment on.
1634| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""One must first raise this question? Why do scientists want to clone human beings? It certainly is not because they are anxious to generate a larger population for our planet."
1635| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|People want to clone humans for their organs.
1635| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""the potential for abuse is enormous."
1636| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Deformed clones would still be happy to be alive.
1636| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""Such an imaginary point-of-view can help us put things in perspective."
1637| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Cloned humans have a soul and are ordinary humans in every way.
1637| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""But what of the souls? Can two people share the one soul? Is it not wrong to force two personalities on to one piece of divine substance? Again, the fact that there are identical twins counts against there being a problem."
1638| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Cloned humans should have equal rights.
1638| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"Brendan Tobin of the Irish Center for Human Rights, an author a UN report on cloning: ""Failure to outlaw reproductive cloning means it is just a matter of time until cloned individuals share the planet."
1639| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Clones are not good or bad.
1639| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""So."
1640| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Clones' quality-of-life depends on how they are received/treated.
1640| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|If clones are treated poorly by society, they will lead less happy lives as others.
1641| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Cloning technology is unsafe for the resulting life.
1641| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|The nuclear transfer technique that produced Dolly required 277 embryos, from which only one healthy and viable sheep was produced.

1646| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Opponents exaggerate the impact that cloning will have on the world.
1646| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""In the big scheme of things, cloning will not significantly change the world."
1647| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|A cloned human would have a diminished sense of identity/individuality.
1647| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Instead of being considered as a unique individual, the child will be a copy of his parent, and be expected to share the same traits and interests, such that his life will no longer be his own.
1648| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Reproductive cloning generally diminishes human individualism.
1648| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""Today, we face another change -- the radical reorganization of life at the genetic level."
1649| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Human cloning makes individuals replaceable.
1649| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""Amongst the arguments raised against cloning has been concern that reproductive cloning would lessen the respect for individuals because of the feeling that they could easily be replaced."

1650| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|"""Many scientists and ethicists caution, too, against “genetic determinism,” pointing out that environmental factors play a critical role in shaping human development."
1651| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|It is a false requirement that clones possess individuality.
1651| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Why should it matter that clones posses individuality? Do other humans have full individuality? Yes and no.
1652| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|"Individualism will be maintained despite cloning, as ""clones"" will develop their own unique identities."
1652| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Children produced by reproductive cloning will be ‘clones’ but not ‘copies’ of their parents: Different environmental factors, nurture, and the process of gestation mean that children will not be emotionally or mentally identical to the people from whom they are cloned.
1653| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Moral arguments against cloning are unfair to future human clones.
1653| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|How would you feel if you were a clone and society considered your creation illegal and your existence deplorable? Our of respect for human clones (human beings in every respect), a ban on human cloning should be opposed.
1661| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Reproductive cloning undermines human dignity.
1661| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Donum Vitae’, the declaration of the Catholic church in relation to the new reproductive technologies, holds that procreation outside the conjugal union is morally wrong.

1679| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Cloned babies would be loved by parents that choose to have them.
1679| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|There is no reason to believe that parents choosing to clone a child will not love their cloned-child as fully as they would love a procreated-child.
1680| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Parental motives can't be used against cloning and not normal child-rearing.
1680| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Furthermore, we should not pretend that every child conceived by sexual procreation is born to wholly well-intentioned parents.

1683| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|Human clones will not reduce human biological diversity.
1683| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|The expense and time necessary for successful human cloning should mean that it will only be used to the benefit of the small minority of people who require the technology.
1684| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|The ends don't justify the means in cloning a child.
1684| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Even if there is a utility for infertile parents, the ends (obtaining a child) don't justify the means (human cloning).
1685| Ban on human reproductive cloning|conclusion|By the will of nature/God infertile couples are not meant to reproduce.
1685| Ban on human reproductive cloning|premise|Nobody has a right to have a child.

2009| Bilateral vs multilateral aid|premise|Providers of aid, for the very reason that they are spending their own money, should have their interests better secured through a bilateral aid arrangement.
2010| Bilateral vs multilateral aid|conclusion|Multilateral aid is less tied to the political self-interest of donor countries.
2010| Bilateral vs multilateral aid|premise|One criticism of bilateral aid arrangements is that they are often drawn up based on self interest.
2011| Bilateral vs multilateral aid|conclusion|Multilateral aid can be equally or more coercive than bilateral aid.
2011| Bilateral vs multilateral aid|premise|The history of World Bank and International Monetary Fund austerity programs and structural adjustment policies in the developing world has amply demonstrated that sometimes multilateral organizations can impose potent and harmful conditions on recipients, interfering with the internal affairs of other nations and doing long-lasting harm.

2051| Biofuel|premise|Matthew Brown, an energy consultant and former energy program director at the National Conference of State Legislatures: “Replacing only five percent of the nation’s diesel consumption with biodiesel would require diverting approximately 60 percent of today’s soy crops to biodiesel production.
2052| Biofuel|conclusion|There are more efficient ways how to harness solar energy than Biofuels.
2052| Biofuel|premise|Biofuels are basically a way of harnessing solar energy; the energy that is stored in the biomass, which is later converted to biofuel, comes from the solar irradiation.
2053| Biofuel|conclusion|Genetically modified crops help produce more biofuel more efficiently.
2053| Biofuel|premise|"""What makes Castro and other radicals so conservative about biofuel? The same thing that troubles Bush about human embryo research: the industrialization of biology."

2066| Biofuel|conclusion|Biofuel development increases demand for scarce water resources.
2066| Biofuel|premise|"""Massive amounts of water are needed to irrigate cornfields, setting up potential competition between farms and homes."
2067| Biofuel|conclusion|The main proponents of biofuel are farmers and their lobbies.
2067| Biofuel|premise|It is simply important to be cautious of the self-interests of advocates of biofuels who are connected to the agricultural industry and have a direct financial interest in the success of a biofuel industry.
2068| Biofuel|conclusion|The production of biofuels is unreliable.
2068| Biofuel|premise|Biofuels rely on agricultural harvest, and as it is commonly known, agricultural products are largely influenced by local weather conditions of the year.
2069| Biofuel|conclusion|Despite ample investment, production costs remain high.
2069| Biofuel|premise|and commercialisation elusive.
2070| Biofuel|conclusion|Subsidizing biofuels helps lower gas prices and save taxpayers money.
2070| Biofuel|premise|"""if the price of oil would be about 15 percent higher were it not for biofuels—then that comes to a savings of about $18 per barrel at current oil prices."
2071| Biofuel|conclusion|Government subsidies are being wasted on biofuels.
2071| Biofuel|premise|Huge government subsidies are being directed at biofuel industries that could be better spent elsewhere.

2235| Bullfighting|premise|According to anti-bullfight veterinarian José Zaldívar, in the great majority of cases, the matador missed the vital spot that would cause the bull to die quickly.
2236| Bullfighting|conclusion|Bulls can't reason, but they can suffer.
2236| Bullfighting|premise|"Jeremy Bentham once said: ""It doesn't matter if they can reason; it doesn't matter if they can speak; what does matter is if they can SUFFER."
2237| Bullfighting|conclusion|Body parts may be cut-off while bull is still alive.

2240| Bullfighting|premise|"Ernest Hemingway said about bullfighting that it is ""a decadent art in every way  if it were permanent it could be one of the major arts."
2241| Bullfighting|conclusion|Bullfighting celebrates death and cycle of life.
2241| Bullfighting|premise|"""Our squeamishness means that we prefer death which is mechanical and invisible, while the Spanish understand that it is part of a cycle."
2242| Bullfighting|conclusion|Bullfighting has long historical and mythical roots.
2242| Bullfighting|premise|Bullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice.
2243| Bullfighting|conclusion|"Bullfighting is ""last serious thing in modern world""."
2243| Bullfighting|premise|"Poet Garcia Lorca said in the 1930s, the corrida is ""the last serious thing in the modern world""."
2244| Bullfighting|conclusion|Bullfighters are good heroes and role models for youth.
2244| Bullfighting|premise|In Spain, many youth idealize bull fighters for their strength, grace, and wit in outmaneuvering bulls.
2245| Bullfighting|conclusion|Bullfighting thrives due to devout local fans, not tourists.

2267| Bullfighting|conclusion|Majority on bullfighting shouldn't dictate end of tradition.
2267| Bullfighting|premise|"""The real danger of all this is that the ban on bullfighting in Cataluna will begin to convince those Spaniards who are agnostic about the bulls – which may well be the majority, in the same way that most English people don't much care for cricket but aren't remotely opposed to it – that the corrida is doomed to die a slow death, that inevitably it will fade away as Spain becomes more like everywhere else, dominated by gaudy globalism and neutered by the homogenising forces of technology and accepted taste."
2268| Bullfighting|conclusion|Majorities in bullfighting states & elsewhere oppose it.
2268| Bullfighting|premise|"""Recent polls have shown that the majority of people are against bullfighting."
2269| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|The Bush 2008 stimulus package is affordable.
2269| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|The $140b included in the stimulus plan is about 1% of GDP.
2270| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Bush's 2008 economic stimulus plan will only add to US deficits.
2270| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Because the Bush administration is already running a deficit, the funding for his 2008 economic stimulus plan will likely have to come from borrowing, adding to the deficit.
2271| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Tax rebates to the lower-middle classes quickly stimulate consumption.
2271| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Rebates put money into the hands of the lower and middle classes, who are more likely to spend their money on services or consumer goods.
2272| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Bush's 2001 tax rebate succeeded in stimulating the economy.
2272| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Numerous sources indicate that, in 2001, the rebates Bush provided of $300 to individuals and $600 to families had a significant impact on the economy.
2273| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Tax rebates can be good for businesses in the service industry.
2273| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Stimulus in forms such as tax rebates could bring relief for businesses such as restaurants facing recent minimum-wage increases, rising commodity prices and changes in customer spending.
2274| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|A tax rebate is not a sustained, long-term stimulus.
2274| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Tax rebates do not give families ongoing wage strength.
2275| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Tax rebates do not always lead to increased spending/stimulation.
2275| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|The tax rebate plan is based on a failed premise: that taxpayers will immediately spend the rebate money they receive on consumer goods.
2276| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|President Bush's 2001 tax rebate failed.
2276| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|If a case study is sought, this is the most recent example of the failure of the 2001 Bush tax rebates to help stimulate the economy.
2277| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|A tax rebate is merely wealth re-distribution.
2277| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Technically, no American is gaining any money under this plan because taxes in future years will have to increase to cover for the $145 billion loss in the federal budget.
2278| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Tax rebates don't encourage wealth production.
2278| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Tax rebates are a cash give-away.
2279| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Tax rebates encourage irresponsible consumer spending habits.
2279| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|This is particularly true in Bush's 2008 stimulus package, which aims to give a tax rebate to the lower and middle classes specifically because these classes are more likely to capriciously spend the money on consumer goods.
2280| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Measures that encourage saving help stimulate the economy.
2280| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|It is often claimed that tax rebates for the middle and lower classes are good for the economy because they go toward spending rather to savings.
2281| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Tax Rate Cuts, Not Tax Rebates, Stimulate the Economy.
2281| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Although tax rebates, increased unemployment benefits and other short-term payments may feel good and appear superficially attractive, they do very little to actually boost the economy and improve Americans' well-being.
2282| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Extended unemployment benefits help bolster confidence/spending.
2282| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Unemployment benefits are a critical backdrop for employed individuals.
2283| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Unemployment insurance does not stimulate the economy.
2283| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Few studies indicate that extending unemployment benefits helps stimulate the economy.
2284| Bush economic stimulus plan|conclusion|Millions of low-income Americans face undernutrition.
2284| Bush economic stimulus plan|premise|Millions of low-income Americans face undernutrition technically termed food insecurity.
2299| Calendar reform|conclusion|The Gregorian calendar is inconsistent.
2299| Calendar reform|premise|The Gregorian Calendar has 12 months of different length (with no month being 1/12 of the year), uneven half- and quarter-years, and no standard first day of the year or of any month.
2300| Calendar reform|conclusion|National holidays would have to be changed under all of the proposed calendars.
2300| Calendar reform|premise|Regular religious observances would also be disturbed.
2301| Calendar reform|conclusion|The Gregorian calendar is anachronistic.
2301| Calendar reform|premise|The Gregorian Calendar is fixed on the starting date of 1 A.
2302| Calendar reform|conclusion|The Gregorian starting point is as good as any.
2302| Calendar reform|premise|Although the Gregorian Calendar had its origins in Christian history, it has its own significance by now.
2303| Calendar reform|conclusion|Standardization of calendars is inevitable.
2303| Calendar reform|premise|History and the increasing globalisation of modern society has shown us that standardisation is inevitable.
2304| Calendar reform|conclusion|Calendar reform is not remotely inevitable.
2304| Calendar reform|premise|Given the total lack of support for change other than in radical fringe groups.
2305| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|"Campaign finance reform would ""level"" the playing field for candidates."
2305| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|Candidates of enormous leadership potential but small wallets have failed due to the lack of resources.
2306| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|"Campaign finance reform will make elections more competitive, thus resulting in more turnover or ""fresh blood"" in politics."
2306| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|This is valuable in challenging old orthodoxies and bringing in new ideas.
2307| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|Even under the most radical proposals for reform, loopholes exist that enable candidates to spend more or reach their audiences through alternative means.
2307| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|This was precisely the kind of development that led reformers to want to close the soft-money loophole.
2308| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|There is actually more turnover in public office than some critics of the present campaign finance systems would like to admit.
2308| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|Retirements, scandals, and careful allocation of party resources make turnover possible under a variety of scenarios.
2309| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|Campaign finance reform advances the objectives of a broader marketplace of ideas and of free speech, assembly, and thought.
2309| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|Under the present system, minor party candidates voices are trampled by the booming voice of large, well-funded campaign operations.
2310| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|Most campaign finance reform proposals actually have the effect of limiting speech.
2310| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|By limiting the amount of money a candidate can spend, what they can spend it on, and the time and nature of the message they can send, candidates’ speech is limited.
2311| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|Campaign finance reform gives the individual donor a voice more comparable to other interest groups.
2311| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|At present, the enormous amount of money channelled into campaigns by large corporations, unions, and special interest groups (Political Action Committees) overwhelm the smaller, limited contributions of individual donors.
2312| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|Even the most radical campaign finance reform proposals have yet to eliminate corporate or union contributions.
2312| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|Short of such bans, the potential for large organizations to swamp the donations of individual voters still exists.
2313| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|"Campaign finance reform will reduce corruption in government by discouraging candidates from ""selling themselves"" to special interests bidding for their votes."
2313| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|Candidates will be less beholden to special interests, and thus, more amenable to listening to good reasons when making decisions about public policy.
2314| Campaign Finance Reform|conclusion|Even after the complete elimination of contributions by groups, the temptation to bow to the wishes of special interests may remain.
2314| Campaign Finance Reform|premise|Additionally, pressure from within one’s own party, personal ideological commitments, and a candidate’s sense of the majority’s opinion in their district will still hold enormous influence on their voting record - regardless of whether the politician feels they should vote differently.
2315| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Debt cancellation would reduce the lives lost to the burden of debt.
2315| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|Some of the most heavily indebted poor countries are struggling to pay even the interest on their loans, let alone the actual capital.
2316| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Debt cancellation has proven effective at reducing poverty.
2316| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|"""Debt cancellation now has a ten-year record of success."
2317| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Debt usually cannot be attributed as the cause of deaths in poor countries.
2317| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|There are many reasons for the current problems in the world’s poorest nations; often they also have heavy debt burdens, but the debt is not necessarily the cause of the problems.
2318| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Even if debt does cost lives, this is not necessarily a reason to forgive it.
2318| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|Many things cost lives in the modern world.
2319| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Forgiving debt may teach the wrong lessons and cost lives in the long run.
2319| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|Letting a country deal with their debt can teach them to never accumulate debt in the first place.
2320| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|"Debts forces countries to produce ""cash crops"" that don't help famine."
2320| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|In order to raise the cash for debt repayments, poor countries have to produce goods which they can sell around the world.
2321| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Famine is the result of many things, not just debt.
2321| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|Again, there are many potential causes for starvation – famines are caused by war or by freak weather conditions, not by debt.
2322| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Debt repayments often punish those not responsible for creating debt.
2322| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|In a number of poorer countries huge debts were amassed by the irresponsible spending of dictators in the past, who have now been overthrown; yet the new government and the people of that country have to pay the price for the dictator’s actions.
2323| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Nations are responsible for repaying historical debts.
2323| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|This thinking has dangerous implications on an international level.
2324| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Poor countries need a fresh start with debt cancellation.
2324| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|While their economies are dominated by the need to repay debt, it is impossible for them to truly invest in infrastructure and education, sowing the seeds for development in the future.
2325| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Reform has to come before debt cancellation.
2325| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|Many poor countries are crippled by corrupt and incompetent governments and economic systems.
2326| Cancellation of developing world debt|conclusion|Rich countries will still earn off of poor countries following debt cancellation.
2326| Cancellation of developing world debt|premise|"""the reality is that even after the debt cancellation provided to date, the world’s most impoverished nations continue to send $100 million each day to the United States government, other wealthy nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and other creditors."
2332| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system incentivizes reductions in carbon emissions where it can be done most efficiently.
2332| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|"""The efficiency ."
2333| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|An effective cap-and-trade system helps reduce economic costs caused by carbon emissions.
2333| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|One of the strongest pieces of evidence supporting this argument is the United States sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade system, in which the economic costs of acid rain damage was dramatically reduced.
2334| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|Cap-and-trade is more flexible in the interconnected global economy.
2334| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|A cap-and-trade system is more flexible in the global economy.
2335| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system is complicated and entails substantial administrative costs.
2335| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|The costs of establishing and administering a cap-and-trade system could be substantial.
2336| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A carbon tax is more predictable and less volatile than a cap-and-trade system.
2336| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|A carbon tax is predictable, as are most simple tax systems.
2337| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|The negative economic effects of a cap-and-trade system would be larger than its environmental benefits.
2337| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|"""Getting the amount of emissions a little bit wrong in any year through a carbon tax would hardly upset the global climate."
2338| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system better encourages companies to cut their carbon emissions.
2338| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|A cap-and-trade system provides companies with credits if they are able to reduce their emissions below an established level.
2339| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system is certain to reduce emissions, which is important in context of the global warming crisis.
2339| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|"""In a cap-and-trade carbon market, total emissions are guaranteed to go down."
2340| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|The market does a better job of directing investments in the best green technologies.
2340| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|"""Subsidizing one or two targeted technologies with a carbon tax would discourage investment in others that may turn out to be more effective."
2341| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|Carbon trading schemes rely on bureaucratic processes to actually reduce emissions.
2341| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|Tax schemes direct the power of market forces towards reducing emissions, rather than merely reducing the price of emissions.
2342| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A carbon tax addresses carbon emissions in all industries.
2342| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|"""Carbon taxes address emissions of carbon from every sector, whereas cap-and-trade systems have only targeted the electricity industry, which accounts for less than 40% of emissions."
2343| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A carbon tax can be implemented immediately.
2343| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|While a cap-and-trade system may take a long time to take effect, a carbon tax can be implemented immediately.
2344| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system is vulnerable to companies tricking the system by polluting heavily before the system begins.
2344| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|The main problem is that baseline emission allowances for companies are based on their past emissions.
2345| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A carbon tax obligates participation, whereas participating in a cap-and-trade system is largely optional.
2345| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|"A carbon tax is an ""opt-out"" program, where all companies are obligated to participate unless taking specific steps to avoid it."
2346| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A carbon tax is less popular and harder to achieve politically.
2346| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|The basic problem is that a carbon tax would be a new tax on the public.
2347| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A carbon tax would also require complicated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.
2347| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|In a carbon tax, emitters would pay a tax for every ton of carbon emitted.
2348| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system demands the creation of a large and highly complicated administrative bureaucracy.
2348| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|A cap-and-trade system demands that the government determine the emissions baselines for companies, the allocation of carbon credits, and the monitoring and enforcement of this all.
2349| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system is more susceptible to corruption than a carbon tax.
2349| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|The complexity of a cap-and-trade system would make it easier for companies to cheat.
2350| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|Governments within a cap-and-trade system have the incentive to cheat.
2350| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|Governments have the incentive to establish conditions favorable to the performance of their own national companies.
2355| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|"It is wrong to tax all carbon emissions, and call them all ""bad""."
2355| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|Carbon emitting energy industries emerged long ago, before anyone thought about the environmental impact of this industry.
2356| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|"A cap-and-trade system is ""fair"" because it rewards ""efficient""-polluters while punishing ""non-efficient"" polluters."
2356| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|Given the above argument, this is a more reasonable approach to rewarding and punishing an industry whose emergence pre-dates the environmental concerns surrounding carbon emissions.
2357| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|A carbon tax fairly treats all carbon emissions as bad.
2357| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|A carbon tax essentially considers all carbon emissions harmful to the environment, and warranting of equal punishment.
2358| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|Companies favor the predictability of a carbon tax.
2358| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|Companies are even willing to pay a premium for the stability provided by this system; the premium being the tax itself, and the lack of the potential for profit through the trading of carbon credits.
2359| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|conclusion|It is ok for some of the costs of a carbon tax to be passed on to consumers because they are also responsible for carbon emissions.
2359| Cap-and-trade versus carbon tax|premise|By consuming energy, consumers create demand for the production of energy and the burning of fossil fuels.
2360| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism run by central bureaucracy, not the people.
2360| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"""In truth, the working classes had much to lose under socialism, and for later generations the shackles of communism would weigh heavy; for in practice, a central person or group had to control the redistribution of the wealth, and under communism power was concentrated for the benefit of the few at the controls — at the expense of the masses, no matter the harm and the suffering visited upon the masses."
2361| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism over-trusts government bureaucrats.
2361| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""Concentrated power is not rendered harmless by the good intentions of those who create it."
2362| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|In capitalism, society is rightly ruled by individuals.
2362| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Only a given individual can assess what is to his benefit or detriment.
2363| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is about individuals collaborating to supply needs.
2363| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|On the most basic level, capitalism allows individuals to organize and work together to supply services and goods that have value in communities, meet needs, and for which other citizens are willing to spend their money on to benefit from.
2364| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|No transaction happens in capitalism unless both parties benefit.
2364| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit."
2365| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Focusing on large corporation distracts from fundamentals of capitalism.
2365| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Capitalism is not about enriching large and powerful corporations.
2366| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism allows for greater personal fulfillment.
2366| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Socialism presents a ""mob rule"" where the collective (or whomever controls the government) outweighs any decisions made by individuals concerning their own lives."
2367| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|In socialist systems, society is ruled by the collective people.
2367| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Under socialism, society is ruled by individuals collectively working together toward a common purpose to enhance the collective good.
2368| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism does not guarantee societies needs.
2368| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|This is because social costs, and everything that affects third parties in a transaction, are externalised (see discussion of market prices later in debate).
2369| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|In capitalism, businesses must put profit before everything else.
2369| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In a system (capitalism) with a built in need for growth and expansion (on every level) based on profit and on a level of competition such that every company that fails to achieve a level of growth and expansion on par with its competitors will go out of business, it is entirely intuitive that businesses can ONLY be about making profit and expanding - everything else is secondary to that goal.
2370| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|In capitalism, profit is made through exploitation.
2370| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|There are many ways that exploitation is used bring profit in capitalism.
2371| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is not ruled by individual, but corporations.
2371| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Corporations are totalitarian structures and are completely unaccountable to the public.
2372| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism has never been about groups of people working together to meet collective needs.
2372| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|It has always been about the ruling class enriching itself at the expense of the ordinary people, particularly at the peripheries of capitalism.
2373| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Genuine socialism is not ruled by a central bureaucracy.
2373| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Genuine socialism means a classless society where everyone owns the means of production and income is still reward based (see the argument and argument page on examples cited against socialism are usually not socialism for more detail on how they are not).
2374| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Market transactions exclude third parties.
2374| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|These third parties could be exploited workers, murdered trade unionists, people who suffer and die from pollution, people who are impoverished, whole species (including humanity) that could get wiped out from climate change.
2375| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism is not about state rule, but individual rule.
2375| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In socialism, individuals are empowered as part of the collective.
2376| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Government in capitalism is not compassionate.
2376| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|It usually serves the interests of (and is comprised of) the elite.
2377| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism incentivizes higher productivity through reward.
2377| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The drive to succeed as an individual is the strongest motivating factor a human being can feel in their work.
2378| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism maximizes benefits of greed, minimizes harms.
2378| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""The problem of social organization is how to set up an arrangement under which greed will do the least harm, capitalism is that kind of a system."
2379| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism favors political greed over economic greed.
2379| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Socialism fosters the power of central planning and of the bureaucrat.
2380| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Best ideas come from individuals, not govt.
2380| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""Columbus did not seek a new route to the Indies in response to a majority directive."
2381| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism removes the incentive to excel.
2381| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|This is a driving force essential for the development of human society.
2382| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism punishes effort, subsidizes laziness.
2382| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""We have a system that increasingly taxes work and subsidizes nonwork."
2383| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism wrongly labels wanting/ambition as wrong.
2383| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"The behavioral schema that was all-too-common in  was like follows: ""You will not want anything from me, I will not want anything from you, and we will all solidarily wait until the end of the working hours""."
2384| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|More people get a chance to be productive in socialism.
2384| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Socialism gives about 4 times as many people the chance to harness their individual desires since they are no longer held back by poverty and class restraints (see the section on inequality, particularly the argument that Inequalities in capitalism stifle individual opportunity as well as the section on class).
2385| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism does not prevent individual success.
2385| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The only thing that socialism blocks is for individuals to earn more, or exploit other people, by virtue of being lucky enough to be born with more talent.
2386| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism subverts community, solidarity, productivity.
2386| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In a capitalist environment the ultimate end is the acquisition of profit through individual success, competition, and low wages.
2387| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism places profits above moral judgement.
2387| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Michael Moore: ""One of the most ironic things about capitalism is that the capitalist will sell you the rope to hang himself with."
2388| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism rewards many people in perverse ways.
2388| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Some footballers or company chief executives earn a thousand times more than nurses.
2389| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Genuine socialism does not promote political greed.
2389| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The argument that socialism puts power into bureaucrats and rulers is flawed, since it comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of socialism.
2391| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism gives everyone the opportunity to succeed.
2391| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Bill O'Reilly: ""For all of its faults (capitalism), it gives most hardworking people a chance to improve themselves economically, even as the deck is stacked in favor of the privileged few."
2392| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is unequal riches.
2392| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|As Franklin D.
2393| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism fosters equal opportunity, not equal outcome.
2393| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|One of the main principles of capitalism is to foster an equal-opportunity meritocracy, in which the most talent (no matter their background and parents) can rise up and achieve anything, mainly because they are the ones that can produce the greatest products and provide the best services to their fellow man.
2394| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Business don't take from poor.
2394| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|It is false to think of capitalism as a zero-sum game in which the only way for the rich to become rich is to take from the poor.
2395| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Income and rewards in capitalism are unequal.
2395| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000, and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total.
2396| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Inequalities in capitalism stifle individual opportunity.
2396| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Since there are such vast inequalities within capitalism some individuals are prevented from a chance of success.
2397| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism does not bring poverty but prosperity.
2397| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Examples of this have already been given in the history section, but suffice to say that the actual examples of genuine socialism have greatly improved the prosperity of the people in those societies and have not caused poverty.
2399| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.
2399| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|This process occurs because in capitalism there is a slope of wealth from the peripheries to the core.
2400| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Poverty is a byproduct of inequalities under capitalism.
2400| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The structural inequality in society is produced by the wealth gap initiated through capitalism.
2401| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism wrongly incites antagonism between classes.
2401| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"""2."
2402| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism divides people into classes.
2402| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|By creating the vast earning inequalities capitalism divides people into classes whereby some people are born into more privileged positions than others.
2403| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is not a political philosophy.
2403| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Capitalism merely entails the ability to buy, sell, or save.
2404| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism relies on righteous belief in freedom.
2404| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself."
2405| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is necessary condition for political freedom.
2405| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom."
2406| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Without rights and property, tyranny of majority reigns.
2406| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"One basic problem with socialism is that it raises ""the public good"" over many individual rights, such as the right to private property (or at least socialism tends to infringe on the right to private property to a higher degree that capitalism and maybe less so that communism)."
2407| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|"Capitalism is guided by people's ""invisible hand""."
2407| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"In Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith argued that capitalism had a ""guiding hand"" which drove people working for their self-interest to help society as a whole."
2408| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialist leadership cannot protect human rights effectively.
2408| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|This type of utilitarian framework neglects appeals for human rights and any other framework of deontology, morality, ethics, etc.
2409| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|"""Collective Good"" is a category error."
2409| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In that who benefits from any situation or policy is an individual.
2410| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism divides and diffuses the power to oppress.
2410| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Socialism places both the control of wealth and the control of coercive force in the same hands, the state.
2411| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism exists under constraints of democratic govt.
2411| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Capitalism isn't a monolithic system - capitalism can have elements of control in it.
2412| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism often subverts human rights for profits.
2412| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|These rights that are subverted include the right to life, the right to live adequately, the right to earn a fair wage, the right to liberty etc.
2413| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism subverts genuine political freedom.
2413| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Capitalism can tolerate democratic forms but not democratic substance.
2414| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|The only genuinely democratic societies have been socialist.
2414| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Examples include the Spanish Revolution, the Zapatista Revolution, Kerala, the Partisan republics of the various anti-fascist resistances at the end of WW2, and smaller examples.
2415| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism impairs the right to food/life.
2415| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"According to the UN ""The Right To Food: Commission on Human Rights Resolution 2002/25” 36 million people starve to death every year despite the fact that the world currently produces enough food to feed everyone and according to the Food And Agricultural Organization Of The United Nations' 2008 report the world could produce twice as much food."
2416| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism is ideal for protecting human rights.
2416| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The argument that socialism cannot protect human rights since it seeks the good of the people is ridiculous.
2417| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism gives corporations tyrannical powers.
2417| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|There are pure unaccountable tyranny, as well as the state.
2418| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is very dictatorial.
2418| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Firstly, capitalism is extremely dictatorial in the economic sphere.
2419| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism only respects liberty of rich to stay rich.
2419| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Bertrand Russell: ""Advocates of capitalism are very apt to appeal to the sacred principles of liberty, which are embodied in one maxim: The fortunate must not be restrained in the exercise of tyranny over the unfortunate."
2420| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism seeks social justice.
2420| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Socialism seeks to redistribute wealth and to ensure that the means of production are at the service of the whole of society, so that all can benefit and none will go without.
2421| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|"Capitalism is no ""invisible hand"", but a crushing foot."
2421| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"The term ""invisible foot"" was coined by E."
2422| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|No transaction happens in capitalism unless both parties benefit.
2422| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit."
2423| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Market prices are always fair prices.
2423| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In capitalism, the market determines price, including pay - the price of labour.
2424| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|State guaranteed prices lead to shortages.
2424| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In , the prices of goods were guaranteed.
2425| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Market prices do not reflect social cost.
2425| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Market prices do not include any costs to third parties, including anything from individual people all the way up to the ecosystem as a whole (these are called externalities).
2426| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Payment schemes under markets are unfair.
2426| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|When people are paid more in the market it doesn't mean that people believe in what they are producing more.
2427| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Markets often go against human interests and values.
2427| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|This is because of the way that they measure success.
2428| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Efficiency isn't the major goal of capitalism as a whole.
2428| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|It will by its very nature provide checks and balances to its working system.
2429| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism allocates capital/resources most efficiently.
2429| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The reason for this is that capitalism gives individual investors the highest of personal incentives to choose wisely where they put their money: putting it where (to that individual's best knowledge) it can make the most money, which is where there is the greatest demand for a service and the greatest ability of a company to provide that service efficiently.
2430| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism provides people with what they actually want.
2430| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Capitalism is based on the idea that services and goods will exist only because there is a demand for them.
2431| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Competition produces more valued goods more cheaply.
2431| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Competition yields better products and more efficient processes in all fields of man's activities.
2432| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialist governments slow progress of markets.
2432| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The guiding hand of government is too strong in a socialist system; it means that change is slow – which means that innovation is missed.
2433| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism has shown itself to be very efficient.
2433| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|A prime example of this is the Spanish Revolution.
2434| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism has shown itself to be inefficient.
2434| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|For example, by 1995, after neo-liberal deregulation which brought a purer capitalism than the social democratic era that preceded it, 95% of financial transactions were speculative and only 5% were related to the real economy.
2435| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism grossly mismanages resources.
2435| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"According to the UN ""The Right To Food: Commission on Human Rights Resolution 2002/25” 36 million people starve to death every year despite the fact that the world currently produces enough food to feed everyone and according to the Food And Agricultural Organization Of The United Nations' 2008 report the world could produce twice as much food."
2436| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism provides people with what they actually want.
2436| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In collective socialism workers' and consumers' councils interact through the participatory planning process to determine what is produced and consumed.
2437| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Centralized currency is biased toward scarcity and hoarding.
2437| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|This is, in part, because it appreciates in value when it is not spent.
2438| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism has control, unlike capitalism.
2438| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Socialist economies are very well planned and has control over all the industries, thus providing a guiding hand in building and contstructing its economy.
2439| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Unplanned capitalist economies undergo dramatic volatility.
2439| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Economies in capitalist systems are essentially unplanned, so they often crash, producing depressions that damage the lives of millions.
2440| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism actively breaks monopolies to foster competition.
2440| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Whilst it is true that monopolies sometimes form, these are combated by regulatory methods like monopolies commissions (witness attempts to break up Microsoft, or regulators forbidding the merger of some airlines on competition grounds).
2441| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalist competition continually improves with technology.
2441| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"Bill Gates: ""The Internet will help achieve 'friction free capitalism' by putting buyer and seller in direct contact and providing more information to both about each other."
2442| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is characterized by monopolies, not competition.
2442| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|As everyone knows, monopolies are often formed under capitalist systems.
2443| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|State monopoly is not present in a socialist system.
2443| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|A truly socialist system is classless and everyone owns the means of production.
2444| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism subverts cooperation.
2444| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|For a society to work (let alone work well) the people in the society need to cooperate together.
2445| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism fosters, does not prevent, charity.
2445| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|There are lot of rich people in capitalist society who provide grants for charity funds, student fellowships etc.
2446| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|There is less charity in a socialist society.
2446| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Every resource considered by the majority to be either necessary or highly desirable is supplied through government.
2447| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism has a systemic bias against helping others.
2447| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Since third parties are externalised from prices in capitalism, it is economically inefficient to consider the effects that something has on others.
2448| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism provides motivation of aiding fellow man.
2448| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The impulse to share wealth and material amongst the community, to support all, leaving none behind, is one of the purest among humankind.
2449| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Charity is not meaningful in a capitalist system.
2449| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Charity is invalidated in capitalism because if you steal a million pounds from someone and then give them a pound of charity because they are starving then that is not increasing their living standards.
2450| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism poorly adapts to change.
2450| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Well, life is unpredictable.
2451| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|There are multiple methods of decision-making in a capitalist society.
2451| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Because of the free market people are free to experiment with various methods of organization and decision-making concerning the acquisition and distribution of resources.
2452| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism puts planning into the hands of the people.
2452| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|In collective socialism workers' and consumers' councils interact through the participatory planning process to determine what is produced and consumed.
2453| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism can effectively respond to crises.
2453| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|A truly socialist society would be far more versatile and flexible than any capitalist one.
2454| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Free trade promotes the most peace and solidarity.
2454| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|When people are interdependent upon one another for goods and services they are significantly less likely to intentionally cause each other harm.
2455| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism grossly misdirects money to military.
2455| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|According to the 1998 UN Human Development Report, the additional cost of achieving and maintaining universal access to basic education for all, basic health care, reproductive health care for all women, adequate food and clean water and safe sewers (in other words, ending poverty) would amount to roughly $40 billion a year.
2456| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism necessitates imperial wars of conquest.
2456| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|See the section (and the extended) argument of how capitalism fosters imperialism, subjugation and suffering for information and explanation on this.
2457| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism necessitates war for profit.
2457| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"In  Alexander Berkman spoke of ""the capitalistic interests of the various countries fighting for the foreign markets and compete with each other there"" and when they ""get into trouble about concessions and sources of profit,"" they ""call upon their respective governments to defend their interests ."
2458| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism does not peacefully accept losses.
2458| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|When capitalism is faced with troubles it's typical reaction (it meaning the elites who run the show) is to steal from the poor so as to offset the (minor) losses that the rich have experienced.
2459| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism could do great damage to the environment.
2459| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Without private means of production there are no private citizens to hold responsible for environmental harm which certain industries may cause if not run conscientiously.
2460| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism has a neutral impact.
2460| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Within a capitalist system, the environment will be harmed only if people choose to engage in economic activity that harms the environment.
2461| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is destroying the world ecosystem.
2461| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Anyone familiar with recent history will know that our species is fast becoming suicidal.
2462| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Socialism has inbuilt mechanisms to protect the ecosystem.
2462| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Since through participatory planning (then planning mechanism for genuine socialism) everyone gets a say in decisions that affect them, the people most affected by an environmental decision would get the most say and would thus override decisions that harm the ecosystem they rely on.
2463| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|The argument that socialism could do damage to the ecosystem rests on two erroneous assumptions.
2463| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|The first assumption is that socialism is a statist society.
2464| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Everyone has a voice within a capitalist society.
2464| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|Whether rich or poor, educated or uneducated, a part of a majority group or a part of a minority group, all non-imprisoned adult persons have the freedom to choose how to acquire and utilize their money.
2465| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|People generally prefer capitalism to socialism.
2465| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|"""Last November  a survey of 29,000 people across 27 countries (almost all democracies) by GlobeScan and the BBC World Service found that only 23% agreed that capitalism is ""fatally flawed"" and needs replacing."
2466| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|That poll shows that capitalism is not popular.
2466| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|More than twice as many people think that capitalism is fatally flawed and needs to be changed than people who think that capitalism is good as it is.
2467| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Other polls show that socialism is more popular than capitalism.
2467| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|For example, according to a recent gallup poll (found ) people in 17 out of 19 Latin American countries are more likely to call themselves socialists than capitalists - For example in Paraguay people are 5.
2468| Capitalism vs socialism|conclusion|Capitalism has always been fought against by workers.
2468| Capitalism vs socialism|premise|This conclusion is strongly supported by the fact that throughout history the working class has fought and struggled against capitalism (see  by David McNally,  by Patrick Barrett et al.
2469| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Cap-and-trade systems ensure emissions reductions to the set cap.
2469| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""In a cap-and-trade carbon market, total emissions are guaranteed to go down."
2470| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Carbon trading incentivizes companies to cut emissions.
2470| Carbon emissions trading|premise|A cap-and-trade system provides companies with credits if they are able to reduce their emissions below an established level.
2471| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Emissions trading encourages investments in best technologies.
2471| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""Subsidizing one or two targeted technologies with a carbon tax would discourage investment in others that may turn out to be more effective."
2472| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Emissions trading wrongly allows companies to buy right to pollute.
2472| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""Carbon Trading IS an Excuse to Avoid Real Emissions Reductions."
2473| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Emissions trading doesn't ensure reductions in local emissions.
2473| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""The principal argument against trading programs is that they do not guarantee that improvements to air quality occur in the local areas that are most affected by air pollution."
2474| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Cap-and-trade systems create emissions caps arbitrarily.
2474| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""Carbon taxes also avoid the baseline quandary that bedevils carbon markets."
2475| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Carbon tax can be implemented much faster than cap-and-trade.
2475| Carbon emissions trading|premise|A carbon tax is simple enough that it can be implemented immediately.
2476| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Carbon trading encourages efficient emissions reductions.
2476| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""The efficiency ."
2477| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Emissions trading reduces economic costs of greenhouse gas emissions.
2477| Carbon emissions trading|premise|One of the strongest pieces of evidence supporting this argument is the United States sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade system, in which the economic costs of acid rain damage was dramatically reduced.
2478| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Cap-and-trade systems are flexible in the global economy.
2478| Carbon emissions trading|premise|Nations that adopt a cap-and-trade system can later link their system into other cap-and-trade systems around the world.
2479| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Emissions trading has govt not markets set cap.
2479| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""There appears to be a misconception among many 'lay economists' that carbon trading is a 'market mechanism' while carbon taxes are not."
2480| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Companies will pollute excessively before starting carbon trading.
2480| Carbon emissions trading|premise|The main problem is that baseline emission allowances for companies are based on their past emissions.
2481| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Complicated cap-and-trade system requires costly administration.
2481| Carbon emissions trading|premise|The costs of establishing and administering a cap-and-trade system could be substantial.
2482| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Cap-and-trade schemes cause job loss.
2482| Carbon emissions trading|premise|By generally making the status quo more costly for businesses, carbon trading can decrease revenues overall and lead to job loss.
2483| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Emissions trading increases government costs and lowers revenue.
2483| Carbon emissions trading|premise|Managing emissions trading costs governments money, yet it does not increase revenues, like a tax can.
2484| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|The EU Emissions Trading System is a success.
2484| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""An analysis of the historical emissions data by the economists suggests that abatement or environmental measure taken by companies had achieved a reduction of about 7 per cent, even allowing for the growth in emissions that accompanies growth in gross domestic product."
2485| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|US cap-and-trade in sulfur dioxidew was succesful.
2485| Carbon emissions trading|premise|The EU cap-and-trade system was founded in 2005.
2486| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|US cap-and-trade in sulfur dioxide was successful.
2486| Carbon emissions trading|premise|This program was initiated by US Congressional legislation in 1990, and has seen major reductions in the emission of sulfur dioxide since.
2487| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|The Chicago Climate Exchange is a success and model.
2487| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""City officials are not sitting idly by waiting to see if or when such things could happen."
2488| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Europe's cap-and-trade system has encountered major problems.
2488| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""Designed to discourage the production of greenhouse gases and encourage investment in cleaner forms of energy, it has rewarded polluters rather than penalising them, and failed to boost alternatives."
2489| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Cap-and-trade systems are implemented too slowly.
2489| Carbon emissions trading|premise|Our fear is that with so many billions at stake, any carbon cap-and-trade program will necessarily be beset by crippling delays, inside-dealing and favoritism run wild.
2490| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Cap-and-trade systems are susceptible to corruption.
2490| Carbon emissions trading|premise|The complexity of a cap-and-trade system would make it easier for companies to cheat.
2491| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Governments under cap-and-trade systems have an incentive to cheat.
2491| Carbon emissions trading|premise|Governments have the incentive to establish conditions favorable to the performance of their own national companies.
2492| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Cap-and-trade systems are susceptible to distortion by lobby groups.
2492| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""I no longer believe that a complicated carbon trading regime — in which industries trade emissions ""credits"" — would work within the United States … So much is at stake for so many industries that the legislative process to create it would be easily distorted by their various lobbies."
2493| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Global C02 trading not like US sulfur trading.
2493| Carbon emissions trading|premise|"""CO2 IS NOT SO2."
2494| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Emissions trading involves sufficient democratic control.
2494| Carbon emissions trading|premise|Emissions trading does not make the environment and emissions into property and place all power in the hands of the markets.
2495| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|A cap-and-trade system is progressive.

2496| Carbon emissions trading|conclusion|Carbon trading fairly punishes inefficient polluters.

2512| Castration of sex offenders|premise|"""what is it that pushes sexual predators to want to give up their virility? I suspect it's that they understand better than the rest of us that rape and most other sexual offenses have little to due with sex — and more to do with physical domination."

2549| Castration of sex offenders|premise|It is important that if the courts make a mistake, that they be able to compensate in some way for their mistake.
2550| Castration of sex offenders|conclusion|Surgical castration can't be avoided/overridden by offender.
2550| Castration of sex offenders|premise|There are many ways in which a determined offender could avoid chemical castration (merely by leaving a country, they could avoid being required to take drug).
2551| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Church contraception policy focuses on saving souls not lives.
2551| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The opposition puts this debate in a very different context, seeing it within the framework of the Catholic Church.
2552| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Evil  should not be used to fight evil .
2552| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Neither is it valid to argue, as a justification for sexual intercourse which is deliberately contraceptive, that a lesser evil is to be preferred to a greater one, or that such intercourse would merge with procreative acts of past and future to form a single entity, and so be qualified by exactly the same moral goodness as these.
2553| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|If people followed Christian principles.
2553| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The twin problems of AIDS and population growth are not a direct result of Church teaching but rather Catholics picking and choosing which doctrines to follow.

2562| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Contraceptives protect married women from HIV-infected husbands.
2562| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|"""Extolling abstinence and fidelity, as the Catholic Church does, will not protect her; in all likelihood she is already monogamous."
2563| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Condoms are needed where abstinence is not an option for women.
2563| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|"""Of course, never having sex will significantly reduce the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease."
2564| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Church condom policies fail to adapt to harsh modern realities.
2564| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|"""If men did not stray, if women had rights, if AIDS did not kill, perhaps the church’s strict ban on condom use would be morally defensible."
2565| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Life should form by God's will, not by human birth control.
2565| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|"""On a more general level, there exists in contemporary culture a certain Promethean attitude which leads people to think that they can control life and death by taking the decisions about them into their own hands."
2566| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|If life begins at conception, contraception cannot violate life.
2566| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|One of the main Catholic arguments against abortion is that life begins at conception, or when the sperm enters the egg.

2568| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Condom-use is a responsible act of sexual maturity and prevention.
2568| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Condom-use, in modernity, is seen as a wise and responsible act for those that are sexually active.
2569| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Sexual morality can/should go hand-in-hand with condom-use.
2569| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|There is no reason that sexual morality cannot be taught along with the distribution of condoms.
2574| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Church contraception policy properly based on faith not reason.
2574| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|"Thomas Aquinas wrote, ""If the only way open to us for the knowledge of God were solely that of reason, the human race would remain in the blackest of ignorance."
2575| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Pope Paul VI ruled against contraception in the 1960s.
2575| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The 1963-66 commission was set up only to advise the Pope and ultimately until a subsequent Pope decrees otherwise it is he who is the Supreme arbiter of the Church’s policy, acting as Christ’s representative on Earth.
2576| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Church contraception policy is supported by natural law.
2576| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The Catholic position on contraception is highly influenced by the natural law theory of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas, which deems that sexuality has as its end purpose, procreation; to interfere in this end would be a violation of the natural law, and thus, a sin.
2577| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|The fathers of the Catholic Church condemned contraception.
2577| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|the seed is not to be vainly ejaculated, nor is it to be damaged, nor is it to be wasted” (Clement of Alexandria).
2578| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Priests need not promote condoms, but should not ban them.
2578| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|UNAIDS Director Peter Piot said in 2001: “When priests preach against using contraception, they are committing a serious mistake which is costing human lives.
2579| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|The 1960 Church Commission ruled in favor of contraceptives.
2579| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The Commission set up to decide on a policy revision in the late 1960s took expert advice both on matters of faith and on the practical implication of allowing contraception.
2580| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Pope Paul VI's 1968 ruling is not binding and can be overturned.
2580| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Importantly the Papal ruling has not been defined as an interpretation of scripture (there is some argument about this) and so is not a ruling on which the Pope was infallible and which binds future Popes, hence the Church does have the ability to overturn the ruling.
2581| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|The bible does not actually condemn the use of condemns.
2581| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Scholars have for centuries argued over whether the discussion of Onan in Genesis condemns him for spilling his seed or for failing to take care of his brother’s wife.
2582| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|The Winnipeg Statement of Canadian Catholic bishops supported condom use.
2582| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|It stated that Catholics could in good faith use artificial contraception.
2583| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Few support Catholic condom policy, undermining Church legitimacy.
2583| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|"Claire Short, the UK’s minister for international development - ""The Catholic church ."
2584| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Condoms help preserve the sexual life of a marriage.
2584| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Without condoms, many married couples may have to forego sex in order to prevent further pregnancies.
2585| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Contraception use leads to the degradation of women and their bodies.
2585| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.
2586| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Contraception use, in most cases, doesn't degrade a woman's body at all.
2586| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|This blanket statement has been a bane of Catholic teaching since the mid-1960's, when it was apparently popularized by Archbishop Wojtyla.
2587| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Contraception is an immoral approach to population control.
2587| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|"""Another present-day phenomenon, frequently used to justify threats and attacks against life, is the demographic question."
2588| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Condoms help Catholics avoid the prospect of abortion.
2588| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The Catholic Church is adamantly anti-Abortion.
2589| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Natural methods of contraception can provide the solution to high population growth.
2589| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|This is particularly true in areas where there is a cultural stigma against condom usage.
2590| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Natural birth-control helps developing world avoid dependencies on developed countries.
2590| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Condom use in developing countries results in a a reliance on condoms from the developed world which can often not be distributed to remote areas and need to be stored within a certain temperature range, impractical in mid-summer in Sub-Saharan Africa where refrigerators are often scarce.
2591| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|"Catholic Church's ""natural family planning"" is ineffective."
2591| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The rhythm method requires observations to be marked on calendars over a long period of time and it doubtful that many newlyweds have the will-power to abstain for their first month together.
2592| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Back-tracking on Church policy against condoms would fracture the Church.
2592| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Regional Churches often feel obliged to follow their faith.
2593| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Church policies against condoms are invasive against developing-country policy.
2593| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The Church’s stance on contraception causes the invasive involvement of the Church in the politics of predominantly Catholic developing nations whose governments are promoting contraceptive use in order to fight AIDS.
2594| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|The Church is not a democracy.
2594| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Whilst political parties often have transparent leadership elections with one member one vote, a ‘One Catholic One Vote’ (OCOV) system for electing the Pope is inconceivable.
2596| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Undoing ban on condoms would prevent schisms in Church.
2596| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Removal would also prevent schisms in the Church around the flashpoint of how to deal with the AIDS epidemic.
2597| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|The Church has changed positions before.
2597| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|The Church is constantly under pressure to adapt to changes in a manner which is spiritually consistent but deals with issues in the material world.
2598| Catholic Church contraception policy|conclusion|Removing Church objections to condoms would increase attendance at Church.
2598| Catholic Church contraception policy|premise|Removing the ban on contraception would help strengthen falling Church membership in developed nations by lifting a burden placed upon its members which a majority of Catholics in developed nations see as unworkable.
2599| Catholic priest celibacy|conclusion|Marriage and family do not distract from priesthood.

2609| Catholic priest celibacy|conclusion|Catholic Church did not adopt celibacy until second millennium.
2609| Catholic priest celibacy|premise|"""More and more Catholics today are coming to understand that celibacy as a universal law for priests had its origins in the 12th century and that during the church's first millennium, priests and bishops -- and at least thirty-nine popes -- were married."

2610| Catholic priest celibacy|premise|"""Eastern Orthodox Catholic priests are allowed to marry."

2615| Catholic priest celibacy|premise|"""Remember several years ago when celibacy was blamed by the media for creating pedophiles? It’s shocking how many otherwise intelligent people still fervently believe that not having sex with women makes men have sex with young boys."
2616| Catholic priest celibacy|conclusion|Lifting celibacy enables sexual exploitation by priests.
2616| Catholic priest celibacy|premise|It would allow priests to take advantage of their position of power to seek to date or court women.
2617| Catholic priest celibacy|conclusion|Priests should be allowed to marry to increase vocations.
2617| Catholic priest celibacy|premise|"""The present plea is justified on the basis that drastic action is needed to restore priestly numbers, which in the Western world have dropped markedly over the past 30 years."
2618| Catholic priest celibacy|conclusion|Allowing priests to marry would not increase vocations.

2621| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol packs many times the energy of corn ethanol.
2621| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""yields from a grass that only needs to be planted once would deliver an average of 13."
2622| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol emits a lower net level of greenhouse gases.
2622| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|Similar to the argument above, because cellulosic energy is three times as efficient as corn ethanol, it is only necessary to burn one-third the amount of it to obtain the same amount of energy.
2623| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol can be 0 emissions.
2623| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|If done sustainable, cellulosic ethanol can emit 0 emissions.
2625| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol is sustainable bridge while new technologies are built.
2625| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"Kelly Tiller, director of external operations for the University of Tennessee’s office of bioenergy programs asks, what are the alternatives? ""There is no perfect solution."
2626| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol is just one  part of the solution.
2626| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"Many critics of cellulosic ethanol say things like, ""if all of the cars in the US had to rely on cellulosic ethanol, all of the available farmland would have to be dedicated to switchgrass and this would devastate forests and the farming economy."
2627| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|General statements in favor of cellulosic ethanol.
2627| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""The arguments in favor of cellulosic ethanol as a replacement for gasoline in cars and trucks are compelling."
2628| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic biofuel production emits significant greenhouse gases.
2628| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""if American corns fields of average yield were converted to switchgrass for cellulosic ethanol, replacing that corn would still trigger emissions from land use change that would take 52 years to pay back and increase emissions over 30 years by 50%."
2629| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Converting grass into fuel is tremendously inefficient.
2629| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""Despite the hype, cellulosic ethanol is no closer to commercial viability than it was when Midgley first began talking about it back in 1921."
2630| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Electric cars are the future, not fuel-based cars.
2630| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|Electric cars, which get their electricity from renewable sources such as wind or solar power, are the future.
2631| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Let forests grow on unused farmland, not cellulosic ethanol.
2631| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""The benefits to wildlife and the carbon storage of planting switchgrass are valid if your baseline is traditional farming."
2632| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol can degrade engines, worsen emissions.
2632| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""Another argument is that the ethanol could burn hot enough to hurt catalytic converters or eat away the seals in various parts of the engine, resulting in higher emissions."
2633| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol can be grown on otherwise unused land.
2633| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""Estes argues that switchgrass would be planted mainly on fallow farmland."
2634| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol packs three-times the energy as corn ethanol.
2634| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|This makes cellulosic ethanol roughly three times as cheap per unit of energy and three-times as efficient in terms of land-use, compared to corn ethanol.
2635| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol does not require same intensive farming, labor, water.
2635| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|Making ethanol from forestry or agricultural waste does not involve the same intensive farming as corn, which requires more water and labor, cellulosic ethanol proponents say.
2636| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol production does not compete with food production.
2636| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|Cellulosic ethanol is wood and grass-based.
2637| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol increases crop values, lowers need for subsidies.

2640| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol land-use harms forests, environment, climate.
2640| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""Carpeting the continent with enough switchgrass to displace all that petroleum use is theoretically possible—but it would be an environmental catastrophe on many counts."
2641| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Renewable energy mandates ensure market for cellulosic ethanol.
2641| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""Among the most important incentives is the renewable fuel standard, or RFS, a federal mandate that requires increasing volumes of renewable fuels -- including advanced biofuels (fuels produced from non-corn feedstocks that have 50% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emission than petroleum fuels) and cellulosic biofuels (fuels produced from cellulose, hemicellulose or lignin that have 60% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuels) -- be blended into transportation fuel in the U."
2643| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol can reduce our trade deficit.
2643| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|By reducing foreign oil imports, cellulosic ethanol brings reduces the flow of money going abroad and concentrates back around local fuel-producers.
2644| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Not enough flex-fuel cars to spur demand for cellulosic ethanol.
2644| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""IEEE Spectrum says there isn't enough farmland in the U."
2645| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Processing cellulose is more difficult than starches.
2645| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""Compared with sugarcane or corn, though, switchgrass is tricky to use, because it provides cellulose—the natural polymer that gives plants their rigidity—rather than simple sugars."
2646| Cellulosic ethanol|conclusion|Cellulosic ethanol can generate good-paying jobs.
2646| Cellulosic ethanol|premise|"""But next generation biofuels can reduce dependence on foreign oil imports in the U."

2653| Censorship of gangsta rap|premise|Gangsta rap is a way for artists to not only capitalize on such a stereotypical image, to profit from a media industry that was already exploiting African-American stereotypes, but also to turn such stereotype into camp and pastiche, a postmodern comment on the nature, reception, and circulation of media images.
2654| Censorship of gangsta rap|conclusion|Gangsta rap is corrosive because it affirms negative stereotypes.

2656| Censorship of gangsta rap|premise|People correctly look to the government as the public arbiter of common morals, for the wider social good.
2657| Censorship of gangsta rap|conclusion|Government censorship is a dangerous form of statist control.
2657| Censorship of gangsta rap|premise|Even if one accepts the argument for some limited form of government censorship to protect public morals, this needs to be very precisely and conservatively defined to avoid the slippery slope towards creeping totalitarianism.
2658| Censorship of gangsta rap|conclusion|Censorship could keep Gangsta rap away from most vulnerable.
2658| Censorship of gangsta rap|premise|It would be an effective method of keeping gangsta rap out of the hands of the people who are most susceptible to suffering from its corrosive message.

3124| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|A test ban treaty does not directly ban nuclear weapons nor their production.
3125| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|Test ban does not erase knowledge of how to build nukes.
3125| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|The CTBT is not a solution due to the fact that the information and know-how to build nuclear weapons will remain.
3126| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|Nuclear test ban lacks commitment to nuclear disarmament.

3129| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|Fear will cause nuclear proliferation, despite testing ban.
3129| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|The Utopian model suggested by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that it will prevent nuclear war and hazards by stopping nuclear testing is fallacious, primarily because fear of nuclear arsenals will continue, which may lead to wars similar to the War in Iraq, just to see whether a country has nuclear weapons or not.
3130| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|New technologies enable detection and ban of nuclear tests.
3130| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|"""Detecting a test of a nuclear weapon has become so effective and reliable that no nation could expect to get away with secretly exploding a device having military significance."

3132| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|Detecting nuclear tests is too difficult to enforce ban.
3132| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|"""While the treaty calls for a total ban on nuclear testing, there is a threshold beneath which the seismic network will be unable to detect tiny events, Lay says."
3133| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|Enforcing a test ban, not detecting tests, is the issue.
3133| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|While detection is a problem, even if we assume that detection is possible, the main issue surrounds enforcing the treaty after detecting a test.
3134| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|Nuclear Test Ban lacks force behind it.
3134| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|"""As for deterrence, it's a simple concept: convince others that the cost of taking an action you wish to prevent is far greater than any benefits."
3135| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|conclusion|Enforcing a nuclear test ban is a risky proposition.
3135| Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|premise|Under a test ban treat, any sort of testing, whether civil or military in nature, will be - officially - intolerable.

3166| Compulsory voting|premise|Such a system guarantees that the government represents a majority of the population, not only a minority of individuals who vote.
3167| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting would reduce polarization.
3167| Compulsory voting|premise|"""My prediction, based on the difference between voters and nonvoters in the United States today, is that it would reduce political polarization."
3168| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting decreases need for big dollars in campaigns.
3168| Compulsory voting|premise|Because mandatory voting means that no large campaign funds are needed to goad voters to the polls, the role of money in politics will decrease.
3169| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting would compel broader campaign messaging.
3169| Compulsory voting|premise|"""Campaigns wouldn't have to spend nearly as much time on voter mobilization, nor would they be able to target their message simply to the most passionate partisan members of the electorate."
3170| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting reduces power of lobbying groups.
3170| Compulsory voting|premise|A benefit of compulsory voting is that it makes it more difficult for special interest groups to vote themselves into power.
3171| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting decreases risk of political instability.
3171| Compulsory voting|premise|High levels of participation decreases the risk of political instability created by crises or dangerous but charismatic leaders.
3172| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting does not enhance legitimacy of govt.
3172| Compulsory voting|premise|Even if compulsory voting allows for abstention, legitimacy is not improved.
3173| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting pushes ignorant to vote.
3173| Compulsory voting|premise|Some individuals resent the idea of compulsory voting, particularly if they have no interest in politics or no knowledge of the candidates.
3174| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Not voting is often a form of political expression.
3174| Compulsory voting|premise|Supporters of voluntary voting assert that low voter participation in a voluntary election is not necessarily an expression of voter dissatisfaction or general political apathy.
3175| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting may increase hold of established parties.
3175| Compulsory voting|premise|"""the political system in America is concentrated in two parties, with only minor successes of alternate parties."
3176| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting expands government, limits freedom.
3176| Compulsory voting|premise|"""compulsory voting will require processes and man power to ensure adherence."
3177| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Forcing a vote is as bad for democracy as poor turnout.
3177| Compulsory voting|premise|"""I do recognise that a low turnout in elections lends itself to questions about the legitimacy of those elected – and indeed, in the institutions themselves."
3178| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting compels voters to better educate themselves.
3178| Compulsory voting|premise|Compulsory voting will potentially encourage voters to research the candidates' political positions more thoroughly.
3179| Compulsory voting|conclusion|First-time voters will better inform themselves.
3179| Compulsory voting|premise|"""In Australia, the case that I know the best, these nonvoters who are being drafted into the political system were referred to pejoratively as 'donkey voters' who vote for candidates based only on their order on the ballot."
3180| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting won't compel voters to become more informed.
3180| Compulsory voting|premise|Compulsory voting will not bring people's attention to politics.
3181| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting may cause backlash against participation.
3181| Compulsory voting|premise|Compulsory voting may discourage political education of the citizens because people forced to participate may react against the perceived source of oppression.
3182| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting mistrusts intelligence of citizens.
3182| Compulsory voting|premise|"""compulsory voting is a extreme form of cynicism."
3183| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Voting is more of a duty than a right.
3183| Compulsory voting|premise|"""There probably are a lot of people who believe that not serving on juries is a right."
3184| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Voting as duty makes people take it more seriously.
3184| Compulsory voting|premise|"""So I’ve now become a believer in seeing voting as a duty on the theory that regarding it as obligatory, as opposed to elective, forces one to take it a tad more seriously."
3185| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting is smaller intrusion than jury duty, taxes, etc.
3185| Compulsory voting|premise|Other civic duties also exist, like paying taxes, attending school and, in some democracies, military conscription and jury duty.
3186| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Benefits of mandatory voting outweigh costs to freedoms.
3186| Compulsory voting|premise|"""Mandatory voting comes with a price: a modest loss of freedom."
3187| Compulsory voting|conclusion|"Mandatory voting undermines the ""right"" to vote."
3187| Compulsory voting|premise|Voting is not a civic duty, but rather a civil right.
3188| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Voting is not a civic duty.
3188| Compulsory voting|premise|A duty is a duty only when there is some tangible service involved.
3189| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting violates freedom of choice.
3189| Compulsory voting|premise|A democracy is based on the principle of respecting basic human freedoms, such as free choice.
3190| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting may infringe on freedom to express one's relgion.
3190| Compulsory voting|premise|For example, most Jehovah's Witnesses believe that they should not participate in political events.
3191| Compulsory voting|conclusion|"Voters could be given option to vote ""none of the above""."
3191| Compulsory voting|premise|"""The message has to be clear: We're not trying to make you vote for anybody."
3192| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Protest voting composes a small percentage of total.
3192| Compulsory voting|premise|"""There's not a lot of evidence that many people are casting protest votes or intentionally foolish votes or are spoiling their ballots."
3193| Compulsory voting|conclusion|There are many reasons for not participating in elections.
3193| Compulsory voting|premise|"""People have genuine reasons not to vote."
3194| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Punishment for not voting could be modest but symbolic.
3194| Compulsory voting|premise|A fine could be imposed of between $15 and $100.
3195| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Exemptions for when citizens can't vote/pay.
3195| Compulsory voting|premise|Although voting in a country may be compulsory, penalties for failing to vote are not always strictly enforced.
3196| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting would be difficult to enforce.
3196| Compulsory voting|premise|"""compulsory voting would probably cause additional problems in administering the vote, as well as problems in enforcement."
3197| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Unacceptable to punish citizens when they aren't harming others.
3197| Compulsory voting|premise|"""Article 21 of our constitution provides for 'Personal liberty'."
3198| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting helps protect voter access.
3198| Compulsory voting|premise|In a similar way that the secret ballot is designed to prevent interference with the votes actually cast, compulsory voting prevents interference with access to the vote.
3199| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Quality of decisions matters more than access to vote.
3199| Compulsory voting|premise|The important thing is that informed citizens are electing the best possible candidates to lead communities, states, and an entire country.
3201| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting delivers more votes to Democrats.
3201| Compulsory voting|premise|"""And while there is no proving that higher turnout means more left-leaning votes, political scientists of both stripes tend to believe that mandatory voting delivers more votes to the left than to the right."
3202| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting has been succesful in Australia.
3202| Compulsory voting|premise|Australia has had mandatory voting for decades without any problems and without serious protest or complaint.
3203| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting exists in over 30 countries.
3203| Compulsory voting|premise|There are currently 32 countries with compulsory voting.
3204| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Mandatory voting is cheaper in less populated countries.
3204| Compulsory voting|premise|"""Keeping in mind that the United States has more than ten times the voting population of Australia, the financial cost for the two nations is vastly different."
3205| Compulsory voting|conclusion|American people will come around to mandatory voting.
3205| Compulsory voting|premise|"""There was a poll a while back that found that more than 70 percent of Americans opposed a compulsory voting system."
3206| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting won't necessarily make sure the better and capable government comes into power.
3206| Compulsory voting|premise|Look, just because people are forced to vote now, it doesn't change the fact that they refused to vote in the first place because none of the political parties/candidates contesting has swayed their interest.
3207| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Vast majority of Americans oppose mandatory voting.
3207| Compulsory voting|premise|An ABC News poll conducted in the summer of 2004 found that 72 percent of those surveyed oppose the idea.
3208| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting would undermine barometer of interest.
3208| Compulsory voting|premise|"""Mandatory voting would be a nightmare to enforce and would rob us of an important barometer of public interest in politics."
3209| Compulsory voting|conclusion|Compulsory voting causes anti-govt feelings.
3209| Compulsory voting|premise|Democracy is based on the freewill of the individual.

3213| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Putting a condom machine in a school does not mean that all students are encouraged to have sex.
3213| Condoms in schools|premise|Teenage sex predates both condom machines and high schools.
3214| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Condoms for students can offend people from different religions.
3214| Condoms in schools|premise|Catholics and followers of other religions who do not believe in birth control, and orthodox practitioners of a number of the world’s religions find the apparent encouragement of sexual activity an affront to their religious traditions.
3215| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Religious considerations are not irrelevant.
3215| Condoms in schools|premise|Various religions are members of society, and these citizens have a right to voice their views about condom distribution or machines in their schools.

3218| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Condoms in schools would encourage sex and so increase STD risks.
3218| Condoms in schools|premise|I feel that if condoms in schools could in fact increase the incidence of venerial disease as it could spread the information to the younger students still not achieved puberty.
3219| Condoms in schools|conclusion|The effectiveness of condoms is exaggerated.
3219| Condoms in schools|premise|If not used properly, condoms can be highly ineffective.
3220| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Providing condoms to students is the morally pragmatic thing to do.
3220| Condoms in schools|premise|Educators need not endorse sexual activity, but they can encourage students to make wise choices if they decide to have sex.
3221| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Providing condoms to students is a wise investment of government funds.
3221| Condoms in schools|premise|A fortune is spent by world governments each year addressing the public health problems created by risky sexual behaviour.
3222| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Taxpayers should not have to support objectionable condom-distribution programs.
3222| Condoms in schools|premise|This is even if there seem to be pragmatic justifications for the action.
3223| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Providing access to birth control empowers women with more control over their bodies.
3223| Condoms in schools|premise|Historically women have often suffered more because of restrictive policies related to reproduction (abortion laws, restrictions on birth control purchases, parental consent policies).
3224| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Condom distribution encourages the responsibility of men.
3224| Condoms in schools|premise|It can also establish condom use as the norm, not something that women continually have to negotiate, often from a position of weakness.
3225| Condoms in schools|conclusion|Widespread condom distribution will establish sexual activity.
3225| Condoms in schools|premise|creating peer pressure to participate in sex.

3234| Constitutionality of US health insurance mandates|conclusion|Individual mandates will be met by individual lawsuits.
3234| Constitutionality of US health insurance mandates|premise|"""If an individual mandate is passed, it seems likely that courts will be faced with claims from individuals who can afford to purchase health insurance, but who will protest that they should be free to determine whether their earnings are best used for other purposes."

3243| Constitutionality of US health insurance mandates|premise|"""the action of refusal actually has an effect on interstate commerce, because in shrinking the risk pool of insured the premiums would incrementally rise."

3286| Corn ethanol|conclusion|It requires less petroleum to produce corn ethanol than gasoline.
3286| Corn ethanol|premise|While some argue that it more petroleum is burned in the production of corn ethanol than is burned in the production and use of gasoline, multiple studies indicate otherwise.
3287| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Ethanol energy is a net CO2 polluter.
3287| Corn ethanol|premise|The primary concern here is the amount of fossil fuels that are burned in the process of producing corn ethanol, not just the emissions from the burning of corn ethanol alone.
3288| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol incentivizes deforestation, contributing to global warming.
3288| Corn ethanol|premise|Increasing demand for ethanol incentivizes the deforestation of rainforests and other areas to make way for corn crops.
3289| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol cannot compete with oil.
3289| Corn ethanol|premise|In terms of net energy gain, there is little comparison between corn ethanol and oil.

3304| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol is a good local replacement for oil.
3304| Corn ethanol|premise|On farms and towns where corn is being produced, corn ethanol is a particularly attractive fuel option.
3305| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol is merely a part of the equation in replacing oil.
3305| Corn ethanol|premise|Very few people argue that corn ethanol is THE replacement for oil and the solution to global warming.
3306| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol production is becoming more efficient relative to gasoline.
3306| Corn ethanol|premise|While the technology and production methods advance in support of corn ethanol and as adequate corn supply is developed, the price of corn ethanol will decrease.
3307| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol will not be a significant substitute for oil.
3307| Corn ethanol|premise|Corn ethanol production and use is currently only about 1% of US petroleum production and use.
3308| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol production demands too much oil to lower oil dependencies.
3308| Corn ethanol|premise|Corn ethanol production demands a substantial amount of oil in the processing of corn into alcohol.
3309| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol has a positive effect on air quality.
3309| Corn ethanol|premise|"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory tested a 1998 Ford Taurus FFV running on E85, reporting, ""Emissions of total potency weighted toxics (including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde) for the FFV Taurus tested on E85 were 55% lower than that of the FFV tested on gasoline."
3310| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol damages air quality and causes respiratory illnesses.
3310| Corn ethanol|premise|A health study by a Stanford professor indicates that emissions from the burning of corn ethanol production could have equal or worse air-quality and health effects as compared to the burning of gasoline.
3311| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn feedstock is a beneficial byproduct of corn ethanol production.
3311| Corn ethanol|premise|The production of corn ethanol produces feedstock as a byproduct.
3312| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol contributes to soil erosion and runoff.
3312| Corn ethanol|premise|To produce corn ethanol, corn must be grown.
3313| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Making ethanol from corn does not deprive the needy of food.
3313| Corn ethanol|premise|The primary issue with world famine is the difficulty of transporting existing food resources to the poor and needy.
3314| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol increases the price of corn and related foods.
3314| Corn ethanol|premise|Corn ethanol increases the demand for corn, while it is difficult for supply to keep pace.
3315| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn requires less water than many other crops.
3315| Corn ethanol|premise|Corn generally uses less water than soybeans and cotton in Pacific and Mountain regions.
3316| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Producing corn for ethanol requires too much water.
3316| Corn ethanol|premise|Water scarcity globally makes the heavy demand for water in the growth of corn crops very damaging.
3317| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol production damages water quality.
3317| Corn ethanol|premise|All farming, particularly with row crops like corn, results in soil run-off.
3318| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol is energy efficient.
3318| Corn ethanol|premise|"""Corn ethanol is energy efficient."
3319| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Many race cars run on corn ethanol.
3319| Corn ethanol|premise|Ethanol fuel has a high octane level, which makes it a high-performance fuel that is desirable to many race car drivers.
3320| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol is less energy efficient than regular gasoline.
3320| Corn ethanol|premise|A gallon of E-85 (fuel that contains 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) has an energy content of 80,000 Btu — compared with about 118,000 Btu for a gallon of gas.
3321| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Sugar ethanol yields more energy and power than corn ethanol.
3321| Corn ethanol|premise|A study, published in the July 2005 issue of BioScience, the journal of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS)assessed assessed the energy required to produce the crops and to manufacture and distribute the resulting fuels.
3322| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Modern engines have been made ethanol-compatible.
3322| Corn ethanol|premise|Over the past 20 years, engine manufacturers have made their engines compatible with corn ethanol fuels.
3323| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol acts as an antifreeze in the wintertime.
3323| Corn ethanol|premise|As such, corn ethanol eliminates the need to use artificial anti-freeze.
3324| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Ethanol-blended fuels are approved under many auto warranties.
3324| Corn ethanol|premise|This is largely because ethanol has been around for so long, and car manufacturers have been making their engines compatible for the past 20 years.
3325| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Ethanol fuel is bad for engines.
3325| Corn ethanol|premise|Examples of extreme corrosion of ferrous components, and internal separation of portions of rubber fuel tanks have been observed in some vehicles using ethanol fuels.
3326| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Most engines are compatible only with ethanol mixed with gasoline.
3326| Corn ethanol|premise|Fuels with more than 10% ethanol are not compatible with non E85-ready fuel system components.
3327| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol is an immediate alternative fuel solution.
3327| Corn ethanol|premise|"This is one of the main arguments the US president Bush put forward in his advocacy of corn ethanol, saying in 2006, ""Ethanol has the largest potential for immediate growth."
3328| Corn ethanol|conclusion|Corn ethanol is inferior to sugar ethanol.
3328| Corn ethanol|premise|Sugar ethanol achieves much greater energy output than corn ethanol.

3331| Corn ethanol|premise|"On the grounds that there are more efficient, more ""green"" energy alternatives than corn ethanol, many environmentalists oppose the further development of corn ethanol."
3332| Corporal punishment of adults|conclusion|Criminals must be punished, and any form of punishment recognizes the fact that on committing criminal acts they surrender some of their rights as humans.
3332| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|Why, logically, is corporal punishment any more of an infringement of these rights than prison? Corporal punishment is an easy, strong, visible, and therefore effective deterrent as well as a proportionate punishment for certain crimes.
3333| Corporal punishment of adults|conclusion|Punishing with pain is barbarian.
3333| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|a throwback to societies built on military might, slavery and the treatment of criminals as humans without any rights.
3334| Corporal punishment of adults|conclusion|Like all forms of punishment, flogging and whipping can and should be subject to regulation.
3334| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|In Singapore, for example, caning is confined generally to young males between 16 and 50, with a maximum number of 24 strokes which must be administered all at once.
3335| Corporal punishment of adults|conclusion|Any regulation tends to be arbitrary and allow abuse.
3335| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|Singapore’s list of crimes for which caning may be sentenced includes the transport of fireworks or a third road traffic offence.

3337| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|Since their freedom is already gone and their date of release may seem distant (or non-existent), there is very little else with which to maintain order.
3338| Corporal punishment of adults|conclusion|There are always alternative punishments that can be used in prison.
3338| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|solitary confinement, the removal of privileges, extension of sentence and so on.
3339| Corporal punishment of adults|conclusion|Societies with a collective mentality need less strict punishment laws than societies without.
3339| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|the USA doesn’t have more crime than Singapore because of the lack of corporal punishment but precisely because of the lack of a behavioural norm.
3340| Corporal punishment of adults|conclusion|Corporal punishment is appropriate for some cultures, but not for others.
3340| Corporal punishment of adults|premise|Citizens of Western democracies such as the USA find a great deal of state control and authority frightening, and hold very diverse views on acceptable behavior and appropriate punishment.
3341| Corporal punishment of children|conclusion|Corporal punishment is a good tool for disciplining unruly children.

3351| Corporal punishment of children|premise|The actual physical damage inflicted via corporal punishment on children can be horrifying.
3352| Corporal punishment of children|conclusion|Abuses do not demonstrate corporal punishment is inherently wrong.
3352| Corporal punishment of children|premise|While it is true that corporal punishment can be abused, this does not demonstrate that it is always abused, or that it is inherently abusive.
3353| Corporal punishment of children|conclusion|There is a difference between corporal punishment and child abuse.
3353| Corporal punishment of children|premise|Corporal punishment is designed to punish specific acts of significant misbehavior and delinquency.

3360| Corporal punishment of children|conclusion|Risks of sexual abuse with spanking can be regulated.
3360| Corporal punishment of children|premise|"""It is, of course, a concern that some parents or teachers might derive sexual gratification from beating children, but is it a reason to eliminate or ban the practice? Someone might suggest that it is, if the anticipated sexual pleasure led to beatings that were inappropriate--either because children were beaten when they should not have been, or if the punishment were administered in an improper manner."
3361| Corporal punishment of children|conclusion|Corporal punishment on the buttocks is a sexual violation.
3361| Corporal punishment of children|premise|"""Slapping or any other type of force used on the buttocks is a sexual violation: The buttocks are an erogenous zone of the human body."

3364| Corporal punishment of children|premise|There are always ways to discipline children that do not involve violence, and which are inherently superior than resorting to violence.
3365| Corporal punishment of children|conclusion|Corporal punishment can be regulated within orderly framework.
3365| Corporal punishment of children|premise|Corporal punishment must be used as part of a wider strategy and at the correct time: when other immediate discipline has failed; when the child understands their behaviour and has had an opportunity to explain it; and after an initial warning and opportunity for the child to repent.
3366| Corporal punishment of children|conclusion|Regulation of corporal punishment does not soften ill effects.
3366| Corporal punishment of children|premise|No matter how orderly you make the beating of a child, there are a number of adverse effects.

3575| Covenant marriage|conclusion|No one is going to be forced to have a covenant marriage, but it should be available to people as a choice.
3575| Covenant marriage|premise|If more people choose covenant marriages, it simply proves that they reject the looser moral values of the liberal establishment.
3576| Covenant marriage|conclusion|If covenant marriage is given legal status, it will rapidly become a forced norm.
3576| Covenant marriage|premise|Couples planning to be married will face pressures from each other, their families, their ministers, and society at large to choose a covenant marriage.
3577| Covenant marriage|conclusion|Covenant marriage is essentially a religious concept, which means that it's legal stature would threaten the notion of separation of church and state.
3577| Covenant marriage|premise|Couples who choose traditional marriages may also be discriminated against, and their children looked down upon.
3578| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching evolution exclusively is dangerous to science and reason.
3578| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|To exclude a set of ideas a priori is to potentially exclude the truth.
3579| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Creationism is scientifically testable.
3579| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method.
3580| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Evolution is unobserved.
3580| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|The term evolution can describe a number of things, some of which are directly observable while others are not.
3581| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|The theory of evolution is not falsifiable.
3581| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|The fact that evolution is present is true, and that isn't what many creationists who are well informed argue.
3582| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching creationism is dangerous to science and reason.
3582| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|"If a theory that does not follow the scientific method is taught in schools as ""science"", science and reasoning will be undermined."
3583| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Creationism is not scientifically testable.
3583| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|The creationist account is an explanation that is not based on empirical evidence.
3584| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Evolution is an observable fact.
3584| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|While creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a theory, this is not exactly the case.
3585| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching creationism's truth is necessary in upholding the truth of the Bible.
3585| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|There is a great deal at stake in the claim that God did not create the world in seven days: the Bible says that he did; if he did not, then the Bible is wrong.
3586| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|If we are descended from animals then the unique relationship between man and god is undermined.
3586| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|There is nothing to separate us from the beasts, and no moral basis for feeling ‘special’ and acting differently from them.
3588| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|It is not 'appropriate' to teach creationism as a means for upholding the bible.
3588| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|This pre-supposes that the bible should be upheld in a literal sense.
3589| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state.
3589| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|A separation of Church and state necessitates that public schools not be a forum for upholding the validity or truth of certain faiths.
3591| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Creationism makes a false historical/scientific claim that is detached from the broader precepts of belief in God.
3591| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|The belief that God creates and sustains the world is not the same as the belief that God created the world in seven days a few thousand years ago.
3592| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Evolution makes no judgment about the existence of God or Jesus.
3592| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|It only tries to explain the process by which species develop from other species.
3593| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|The Bible is simply wrong if a literal interpretation is taken.
3593| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|On this question, the Bible just is wrong, and if you insist on holding a literalistic approach to Scripture then the implications you claim do indeed follow.
3594| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|The idea that creationists reject mutation or natural selection is ridiculous.
3594| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|These are observable facts.
3595| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Open-mindedness toward creationism is important.
3595| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|People should not reject discussion of Creationist theory simply because their belief in science and evolution contradict evolution.
3596| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Attempts to conceal the creationism-evolution controversy from students are dogmatic promotions of evolution.
3596| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Not since blasphemy laws has competitive expression of thought been illegalized, and this is what evolutionists want to accomplish.
3597| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching darwinism is comparable to teaching flying spaghetti monsterism.
3597| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|We've observed the ability of rapidly moving water to carve out canyons resembling the Grand Canyon (see: Little Grand Canyon, Mt.
3598| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching the creationism-evolution controversy is important to student learning.
3598| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|One of the greatest lessons that a school can teach its students is the ability to use their own logic and reasoning to develop an objective opinion of the world around them.
3599| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Preventing the teaching of creationism violates freedom of religion.
3599| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Many groups contend that evolution directly instructs that Genesis is wrong.
3600| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Biology can be studied in a creationist context.
3600| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Some argue that looking at the way in which different organisms work shows us the beauty and perfection of God’s design.
3601| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|"The history of God's creation should be taught irrespective of it being considered ""science""."
3601| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|"Why does creationism have to be considered ""scientific"" to be taught? Spirituality and God's role in creating the world (or even just the possibility of this) are all highly important to understand by students, and should therefore be taught."
3602| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Schools should teach competing theories.
3602| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|The idea that creationists reject mutation or natural selection is ridiculous.
3603| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching Creationism is in no way akin to child abuse.
3603| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Does Richard Dawkins give any support for his claim? Any reason he believes this to be so? It is hard to refute an argument that states ungrounded opinion as fact, but even harder to take it seriously.
3604| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching Creationism would be against the law.
3604| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Bibles and other holy doctrines are not allowed to be used by a teacher for any purpose, so regardless of anything else, it is against the law.
3605| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Attempts to teach the creationism-evolution controversy to students are disingenuous promotions of activist Christians.
3605| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Certainly, it sounds reasonable that creationism should taught in public schools in the context of it being a cultural/religious perspective? Who could argue with this? Many non believers would argue that creationism and Bible are wonderful literary works of fiction, and so, yes, they should be taught.
3606| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching creationism is comparable to teaching flat earthism.
3606| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|"The scientific consensus against creationism is as strong as against ""flat earthism""."
3607| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Schools should not teach theories that are completely at odds with each other.
3607| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Evolution should be a central part of the science curriculum, because the rest of biology is dependent on it.
3608| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Because students are impressionable, if you teach them the literal truth of Genesis as science, they may well believe you.
3608| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Since you are wrong, this is not to be welcomed, particularly since what your teaching involves is a wilful misunderstanding of the nature of scientific method, with implications for their understanding of science in general for the rest of their lives.
3609| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|If creationism should be taught, it should not be taught in science classes.
3609| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|"Opponents point out that there is no scientific controversy, but only a political and religious one, therefore ""teaching the controversy"" would only be appropriate in a social studies, religion, or philosophy class."
3610| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Teaching creationism is akin to child-abuse.
3610| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|This view is put forward by Richard Dawkins, a prominent opponent of teaching creationism in schools.
3611| Creationism vs evolution in schools|conclusion|Public opinion is unimportant to whether creationism belongs in science classes.
3611| Creationism vs evolution in schools|premise|Public opinion does not determine whether creationism qualifies as science.
3618| Crime cameras|conclusion|Inexpensive camera viewing services are avaialable.
3618| Crime cameras|premise|There are professional services which provide very inexpensive camera viewing over the internet.

3622| Crime cameras|conclusion|FBI Reports on the effectivness and future of surveillance cameras.
3622| Crime cameras|premise|"""This increase in numbers of cameras means that more and more criminals are being photographed in the commission of their crimes."
3623| Crime cameras|conclusion|Benefits of crime cameras may not be reflected in crime rates.
3623| Crime cameras|premise|"John Firman, the director of research at the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said a 2007 ABC article: ""We know cameras enhance that capacity but saying for sure that they reduced crime by 20 percent, that's another thing."
3624| Crime cameras|conclusion|Cameras make a small but valuable contribution to crime fighting.
3624| Crime cameras|premise|"""The cameras by themselves are not a crime-solving strategy, but part of an overall network designed to stop criminals before or after the act."
3626| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras have not had a significant impact on crime rates.
3626| Crime cameras|premise|"""The cameras have been installed in phases on some of the city's roughest streets since 2005 with large concentrations of them in the Western Addition and Mission District and others in the lower Haight, the Tenderloin and near Coit Tower."
3627| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras may help prosecutions, but don't reduce crime.
3627| Crime cameras|premise|"Jim Harper, the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, was quoted saying in a July 2007 ABC article: ""They are good forensic tools — after something happens, they'll tell you what happened."
3628| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras help deter crime.
3628| Crime cameras|premise|"""These cameras help to identify who is involved with specific crimes and provide a deterrent to those who know the cameras are installed."
3629| Crime cameras|conclusion|Cameras can deter anti-social behavior such as littering.
3629| Crime cameras|premise|"""Originally surveillance cameras systems were installed to deter burglary, assault and car theft but their use has been extended to include combating 'anti social behaviour', such as littering, urinating in public, traffic violations, obstruction, and drunkenness (Davies 1998)."
3630| Crime cameras|conclusion|Surveillance cameras do not deter crime.
3630| Crime cameras|premise|"""San Francisco's 68 controversial anti-crime cameras haven't deterred criminals from committing assaults, sex offenses or robberies - and they've only moved homicides down the block, according to a new report from UC Berkeley."
3631| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras cannot deter criminals that do not fear the law.
3631| Crime cameras|premise|"""A recent study demonstrating this failure to improve the clear-up rate, however, could not also show that the cameras failed to deter crime in the first place."
3632| Crime cameras|conclusion|Shift in crime means cameras are working, should be expanded.
3632| Crime cameras|premise|If cameras shift crime away from an area, it means they are doing their job of tracking and deterring crime in an area.
3633| Crime cameras|conclusion|Even shifting crime with cameras can benefit communities.
3633| Crime cameras|premise|"San Francisco Mayor said to the San Francisco Chronicle in 2008, ""When I put the first cameras in, I said, 'This may only move people around the corner."
3634| Crime cameras|conclusion|Surveillance cameras merely shift crime to different areas.
3634| Crime cameras|premise|San Francisco's 68 controversial anti-crime cameras haven't deterred criminals from committing assaults, sex offenses or robberies - and they've only moved homicides down the block, according to a new report from UC Berkeley.
3635| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras help restore a public sense of safety.
3635| Crime cameras|premise|"In December, 2008, an armed robbery attempt in New Orleans failed after the victim, according to police, ""."
3636| Crime cameras|conclusion|"Spending on cameras for a ""sense of safety"" is wasteful."
3636| Crime cameras|premise|"""not all city officials think it's wise to spend money on public safety measures if the best thing that can be said about them is they have a placebo effect for worried residents."
3637| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras offer a dangerous false sense of security.
3637| Crime cameras|premise|"San Francisco Police Commissioner Joe Alioto-Veronese said to the San Francisco Chronicle in March 2008: ""In their current configuration they are not useful, and they give people a false sense of security, which I think is bad."
3638| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras help catch criminals and get them off the street.
3638| Crime cameras|premise|"""What is the purpose of the cameras? Crime cameras are useful in fighting illegal activity."
3639| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras offer conclusive, unbiased evidence in court.
3639| Crime cameras|premise|"New Orleans Mayor Nagin said in 2005 when unveiling his crime camera program: ""These cameras not only record crime, they are witnesses that cannot be intimidated."
3640| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime camera evidence is very rarely used in court cases.
3640| Crime cameras|premise|"""Major cities across the country that have launched crime-camera programs have seen similar results."
3641| Crime cameras|conclusion|Damaged crime cameras can be fixed.
3641| Crime cameras|premise|Crime cameras that are not working can be fixed.
3642| Crime cameras|conclusion|Even broken cameras can offer a deterrent effect on crime.
3642| Crime cameras|premise|"Some communities actually use ""dummy cameras"" (props that look like real cameras to criminals) mixed in with operating cameras to deter criminal activities."
3643| Crime cameras|conclusion|Too few crime cameras are working to fight/deter crime.
3643| Crime cameras|premise|"New Orleans City Councilwoman Stacy Head said in the fall of 2008: ""There are so many crimes that have taken place near crime cameras that weren't working, that shoots the deterrent argument away."
3644| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime-ridden communities have right to demand and install cameras.
3644| Crime cameras|premise|"""You can expect any issue that loosely covers the term civil liberties to bring out the masses in San Francisco  Yet, thankfully there was one argument that commissioners just couldn’t brush aside."
3645| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras in public spaces do not really invade privacy.
3645| Crime cameras|premise|"""I count myself among those opposed to more government interference in personal privacy, but that’s not really a big issue here."
3646| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime camera privacy, Big Brother concerns are exaggerated.
3646| Crime cameras|premise|When new crime cameras are being considered and installed in a city, it is typical that the media, civil rights groups, and skeptical citizens exaggerate the claims regarding the implications for privacy, civil liberties, and for the role of Big Brother.
3647| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras violate privacy no more than corner store cameras.
3647| Crime cameras|premise|"""The people who complain about the use of cameras on the street say nothing about their presence in their corner store, the post office, the subway, Macy’s, Safeway or just about every commercial enterprise in existence."
3648| Crime cameras|conclusion|Cameras help protect citizens' liberties against crime.
3648| Crime cameras|premise|"""There’s no doubt that people with thick rap sheets don’t like them, and they’re the people who are really infringing on our civil liberties."

3649| Crime cameras|premise|Cameras are there to protect the public.
3650| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras are an intrusion on individual privacy rights.
3650| Crime cameras|premise|"Former Oakland Mayor (now California Attorney General) Jerry Brown said in 1999 when the City of Oakland rejected proposed video surveillance cameras: ""Reducing crime is something the community and police must work on together."
3651| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras with ID technology deeply violate privacy.
3651| Crime cameras|premise|"""Threat to Civil Liberties from Combined Technologies Government-run video surveillance can radically alter the relationship between law enforcement and the public."
3652| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras lead to slippery slope of Big Brother surveillance.
3652| Crime cameras|premise|Crime cameras are only the beginning of a host of violations of civil liberties on the part of government.
3653| Crime cameras|conclusion|Police abuse crime cameras, leering at women.
3653| Crime cameras|premise|Surveillance cameras are often used by police to leer at women, instead of to fight crime.
3654| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras place security over civil liberties.
3654| Crime cameras|premise|While security interests are important, security cameras wrongly place them over civil liberties.
3655| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras help reduce frequency of community patrols.
3655| Crime cameras|premise|Police typically patrol neighborhoods with a certain frequency.
3656| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras are cost-effective only when used properly.
3656| Crime cameras|premise|"""Even by the standard of San Francisco’s pretty lousy records, SF’s crime cameras have a pretty lousy record."
3657| Crime cameras|conclusion|Maintaining crime cameras costs too much.
3657| Crime cameras|premise|"""Councilwoman Stacy Head said the city has spent $7,500 per camera this year for maintenance and upgrades to each of the 240 cameras, while it costs only $6,240 to buy and install a new camera."
3658| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras are too costly for too few benefits.
3658| Crime cameras|premise|"""New Orleanians have patiently waited for the Nagin administration and its contractors to deliver on promises to install up to 1,000 working crime cameras that would help convict violent offenders and reduce crime."
3659| Crime cameras|conclusion|Police should not waste time watching crime cameras.
3659| Crime cameras|premise|It is a waste of police resources for officers to spend significant amounts of time watching surveillance cameras for signs of criminal activity.
3660| Crime cameras|conclusion|Crime cameras often have no one watching due to limited resources.
3660| Crime cameras|premise|"""Crime in Cirencester town centre is going unmonitored because there is no one to watch the CCTV full-time."
3663| Crime investigation|conclusion|Removing the easy opportunity to commit crime.
3663| Crime investigation|premise|By investigating and impisoning criminals we are sending the message that crime really does not pay.

3664| Crime investigation|premise|Minor crimes trouble our society as they are more common, affect more people, have more victims.
3665| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|conclusion|Harm done by Holocaust denial exempts it from protections.
3665| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|premise|While many claim that free speech rights protect individuals that deny the Holocaust, free speech principles can be justly limited in cases where speech does direct harm to other individuals or society as a whole.

3671| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|premise|The resurgence of Nazism is a real possibility in Europe and elsewhere.

3677| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|premise|"Beate Rudolf, an expert on European law at Berlin's Free University: ""This is a difficult argument because they supporters of banning Holocaust denial are saying that to promote one basic human right you need to limit freedom of speech, which is another basic human right."
3678| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|conclusion|Danger of public accepting holocaust denial should be fought by logic.
3678| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|premise|While Holocaust denial may be dangerous if it gained public support, the government's responsibility should be in fighting this with logic and reasoning opposed to a ban.

3702| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|conclusion|Holocaust denial becomes increasingly threatening as witnesses die.
3702| Criminalization of Holocaust denial|premise|"VHF president Doug Greenberg: ""In 50 years from now, not only will there be no survivors alive, there won't be anybody alive who even knew a survivor, and that is where the real danger lies in Holocaust denial."

3705| DC handgun ban|conclusion|2nd Amendment applies only to the collective right of the militia to bear arms.
3705| DC handgun ban|premise|The language of the Second Amendment creates a situation in which the right to bear arms applies only to the militia.
3706| DC handgun ban|conclusion|If the 2nd amendment was to protect an individual right it would have clearly expressed it.
3706| DC handgun ban|premise|If the intentions of the framers had been to protect an individual right to bear arms, they would have clearly expressed this.
3707| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Unfettered right to bear arms would be too expansive.
3707| DC handgun ban|premise|"""One of the troublesome aspects of viewing this as a right of personal use is that that is the kind of fundamental liberty interest that would create a real potential for disruption."
3708| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Previous Supreme Court decisions ruled that the Second Amendment does not apply to personal guns.
3708| DC handgun ban|premise|Cases such as U.
3709| DC handgun ban|conclusion|English Bill of Rights restricted right to arms.
3709| DC handgun ban|premise|"""JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we're going back to the English Bill of Rights, it was always understood to be subject to the control and limitation and restriction of Parliament."
3710| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The constitution confers an individual right to bear arms.
3710| DC handgun ban|premise|On March 9, 2007 in a blockbuster opinion, the U.
3711| DC handgun ban|conclusion|1st and 2nd clauses of 2nd amendment guarantee militia and individual gun rights.
3711| DC handgun ban|premise|"""JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction between reading the second clause as a -- as a personal guarantee and reading the first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia that resisted the British was not State- managed."
3712| DC handgun ban|conclusion|2nd amendment combines right to militia and individual arms.
3712| DC handgun ban|premise|"""Now, what I think is happening is that two different rights are being put together."

3713| DC handgun ban|premise|A federal appeals court ruled on March 10th that the District's longtime ban on keeping handguns in homes is unconstitutional.
3715| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Handguns would be of little use to a militia fighting the US military.
3715| DC handgun ban|premise|"The notion involved in the ""militia"" clause of the 2nd amendment is that it is important for citizens to have the right to form a militia in order to combat a tyrannical government, and presumably its army."
3716| DC handgun ban|conclusion|2nd amendment could not exist solely to uphold militias as Congress has power to disarm them.
3716| DC handgun ban|premise|Congress has the power and authority to disarm a militia.
3717| DC handgun ban|conclusion|In today's reality the Second Amendment cannot be applied to civilians.
3717| DC handgun ban|premise|The difference in the technology the military now employs versus the personal guns individual civilians can have access to is exponentially greater than in the framer's time.
3718| DC handgun ban|conclusion|An individual right to bear arms helps protect against domestic tyranny.
3718| DC handgun ban|premise|The main intent of the Second Amendment of the constitution was to protect against domestic tyranny.
3719| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Militias are relevant today as a symbol of preventing tyranny.
3719| DC handgun ban|premise|Historically, the militia that resisted the British was a non state managed association of people that were fighting against tyranny.
3720| DC handgun ban|conclusion|To maintain the handgun ban a change in the constitution is imperative.
3720| DC handgun ban|premise|The constitution is the basis for allowing gun possession within the US society.
3721| DC handgun ban|conclusion|If 2nd amendment applied only to militias it would be useless today.
3721| DC handgun ban|premise|If the Second Amendment applied only to the collective right of the militia, it would be useless, as no militias exist today in America.
3722| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Rifles and shotguns are as effective as handguns in self-defense.
3722| DC handgun ban|premise|There is little evidence that a handgun is a more effective as a means to self-defense than a rifle or a shotgun.
3723| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The 2nd Amendment does not express a right to bear arms for self-defense.
3723| DC handgun ban|premise|The 2nd Amendment does not explicitly refer to a right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.
3724| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The Second Amendment confers the individual right to self defense.
3724| DC handgun ban|premise|Modern legal scholarship posits that the amendment is the affirmation of the the individual freedom to posses guns and use them for self protection.
3725| DC handgun ban|conclusion|A ban on legal handguns disadvantages citizens against armed criminals.
3725| DC handgun ban|premise|Criminals, who are able to acquire guns,irrespective of the illegality of doing so, welcome a ban on legal handgun ownership.
3726| DC handgun ban|conclusion|A handgun is uniquely valuable in self defense in one's home.
3726| DC handgun ban|premise|U.
3727| DC handgun ban|conclusion|DC's handgun ban threatens citizens' ability to defend themselves on the streets.
3727| DC handgun ban|premise|The majority of violent encounters occur on the street, versus in the home.
3728| DC handgun ban|conclusion|2nd Amendment conferred a right to defend against various historical threats.
3728| DC handgun ban|premise|Self-defense was a very likely element of the Framers' thinking behind the second amendment.
3729| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Handguns are particularly needed for self-defense in a crime-ridden DC.
3729| DC handgun ban|premise|Handguns are most needed for self-defense in the hands of citizens that are under the most threat, such as in DC's crime-ridden streets.
3733| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Handguns should be banned due to their uniquely dangerous concealability.
3733| DC handgun ban|premise|Hand guns are concealable as well as portable.
3734| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The DC handgun ban did decrease crime immediately after passing.
3734| DC handgun ban|premise|The DC handgun ban did decrease crime and murder rates directly after the ban was passed.
3735| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The DC handgun ban has produced a marginal decrease in crime and murders.
3735| DC handgun ban|premise|A 1991 University of Maryland study by criminologists in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, even despite the fact that the number of deaths in the city had risen to 479 that year, 81 deaths per 100,000, earning it the title of the murder capital of the country.
3736| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Proper regulation of handgun use increases safety.
3736| DC handgun ban|premise|Legal scholar acknowledge that the individual right of keeping arms can be limited for the safety of the community.
3737| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The social harm related to firearms outweighs any social benefits from possessing firearms.
3737| DC handgun ban|premise|It is empirically proven that the numbers of victims from gun related attacks or incidents far outweigh the number of instances when arms were used for self protection.
3739| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Citizen gun ownership acts as a deterrent against criminals.
3739| DC handgun ban|premise|When citizens have guns, criminals fear committing crimes due to the risk that they will be shot.
3740| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Gun bans only disarm citizens that are not inclined to commit crimes.
3740| DC handgun ban|premise|"Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776 - ""Laws that forbid the carrying of arms."
3741| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Cities that have gun ban laws enacted are not significantly safer.
3741| DC handgun ban|premise|The examples of Washington DC and New York show that with a gun ban law they are one of the most dangerous cities within the US.
3742| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The handgun ban prevents law abiding citizens from self defense.
3742| DC handgun ban|premise|The present large amount of guns within the US society and the even larger black market of guns provides the proof that inevitably post any banning of guns they will still be present in society.
3743| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The handgun ban is ineffective at stopping handguns homicides.
3743| DC handgun ban|premise|According to the statements of the DC police that an overwhelmingly amount of the homicides have been committed with handguns.
3744| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Studies that have showed the murder rate has decreased were flawed.
3744| DC handgun ban|premise|The methodology of the studies has proven to be flawed.
3745| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The DC handgun ban has not really decreased crime and murders in DC.
3745| DC handgun ban|premise|Since the handgun ban was first implemented in 1976, more than 8,400 people have been murdered in the district.
3746| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The DC handgun ban is made ineffectual by legal purchases in Maryland and Virginia.
3746| DC handgun ban|premise|DC is very small and very close to Maryland and Virginia, making it very easy for people to legally purchase guns outside of DC and bring them in.
3747| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Alternative measures can be taken in place of a ban to stem crime and murder.
3747| DC handgun ban|premise|There are a range of ways to decrease gun crime and murder in a city, including greater background checks, making sure that bad people don't get guns, more police patrols, and various other alternatives.
3748| DC handgun ban|conclusion|A handgun ban deprives citizens of the most commonly used weapon for self defense.
3748| DC handgun ban|premise|The handgun is used more commonly than any other weapons in self defense in the home.
3749| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Banning one class of arms does not violate an individual right to bear arms.
3749| DC handgun ban|premise|An individual right to bear arms can be interpreted to mean that individuals have the right to bear arms of some kind, but not necessarily every kind.
3750| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Since other gun classes have been banned, so too can handguns for reasonable ends.
3750| DC handgun ban|premise|There is a precedent for banning citizens from purchasing specific gun classes, such as fully-automatic weapons and heavy weaponry such as grenades and bazookas.
3751| DC handgun ban|conclusion|"""Arms"" falling under the 2nd Amendment can be regulated but not banned."
3751| DC handgun ban|premise|"""Once it is determined - as we have done - that handguns are 'Arms' referred to in the Second Amendment, it is not open to the District to ban them ."
3752| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The DC gun ban does not violate 2nd amendment because DC is not a state.
3752| DC handgun ban|premise|In the opinion of the dissenting judge in the DC handgun ban court decision, the Second Amendment cannot apply to DC, since DC is not a state.
3753| DC handgun ban|conclusion|According to the Supreme Court states cannot prohibit people's possession of guns.
3753| DC handgun ban|premise|Legal experts argue that the reserved militia that the Second Amendment is comprised of people capable of bearing arms.
3754| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Constitutional right to bear arms applies to DC residents as much as citizens of other states.
3754| DC handgun ban|premise|Some argue that Washington, DC is not a state, and so the constitutional right to bear arms does not necessarily apply.
3755| DC handgun ban|conclusion|If 2nd Amendment aims only at military preparedness, guns should be available for training only.
3755| DC handgun ban|premise|Some argue that one of the main purposes of the 2nd amendment is to enable citizens to train with weapons so that they are prepared for military service or the draft.
3756| DC handgun ban|conclusion|A handgun ban serves to weaken US military preparedness.
3756| DC handgun ban|premise|Handguns are an important part of combat.
3757| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Historically gun control laws and prohibitions have been applied even at the federal level.
3757| DC handgun ban|premise|In 1969 federal legal initiatives aimed at increasing federal control and regulation over gun commerce, possession and licensing.
3758| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Only very few cities have currently gun ban laws enacted.
3758| DC handgun ban|premise|The fact that nationwide there are very few cities that have gun ban laws enacted goes to show that both the communities and their representatives on the political level do not support such actions.
3759| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Gun prohibition movement has historically failed in the U.S.
3759| DC handgun ban|premise|Starting from early 1970s initiatives for handgun bans started to be struck down as people opposed them .
3760| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Gun control laws do not work since citizens to not comply to them.
3760| DC handgun ban|premise|Empirically by studying cities that have rigorous gun control laws the apparent conclusion is that very few people , percentage wise actually comply to these laws.
3761| DC handgun ban|conclusion|Disarming will not be feasible in the US.
3761| DC handgun ban|premise|Taking into account the large number of guns owned is the US by households and individuals and adding that on top of a philosophy of property rights and freedom from government encroaching upon individual's rights, legal or political initiatives trying to attempt a nationwide disarmed would be prone to failure as they would be rejected on a full scale by the US citizens.
3762| DC handgun ban|conclusion|A strong majority of DC residence support the DC handgun ban.
3762| DC handgun ban|premise|A Georgetown University poll found three out of four city residents supported the DC handgun ban.
3763| DC handgun ban|conclusion|The implications of the DC handgun ban are not supported nationwide.
3763| DC handgun ban|premise|The DC handgun ban case does not have an isolated impact in DC.
3765| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty is proportional punishment/due desert for murder.
3765| Death penalty|premise|US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, Majority opinion in 7-2 ruling that the death penalty is a constitutionally acceptable form of punishment for premeditated murder.
3766| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions respond appropriately to the most heinous crimes.
3766| Death penalty|premise|A two and a half-year-old girl was kidnapped, raped, sodomized, tortured and mutilated with vise grips over six hours.
3767| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions help society express horror and abhorrence of murder.
3767| Death penalty|premise|"""Executing a murderer is the only way to adequately express our horror at the taking of an innocent life."
3768| Death penalty|conclusion|Life imprisonment does not repudiate murder like capital punishment.
3768| Death penalty|premise|"""'The loss of freedom for the remainder of one's life is no mild punishment,' James Bernstein of New York wrote to the Times."
3769| Death penalty|conclusion|Death penalty addresses crimes where victim can never be compensated.
3769| Death penalty|premise|"""If one robs a store, the captured thief can pay back the debt and, in fact, under biblical law (which is better than today's law) would be tasked to work for the man he robbed until the debt was satisfied seven times the value of the goods stolen."
3770| Death penalty|conclusion|Executing killers is not comparable to raping rapists.
3770| Death penalty|premise|"""Abolitionists often insist that if we argue for lex talion justice we must be prepared to rape rapists, beat sadists, and burn down the houses of arsonists."
3771| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty is about punishment/due desert, not vengeance.
3771| Death penalty|premise|"""Opponents of capital punishment describe it as a surrender to emotions--to grief, rage, fear, blood lust."
3772| Death penalty|conclusion|Eternal torture worse than clean break.
3772| Death penalty|premise|Imagine this room.
3773| Death penalty|conclusion|Life in prison is a sufficient punishment.
3773| Death penalty|premise|"""The loss of freedom for the remainder of one's life is no mild punishment."
3774| Death penalty|conclusion|Life in prison is a greater punishment than the death penalty.
3774| Death penalty|premise|If the goal is to punish a person as severely as possible, life without parole can be seen as meeting this objective better than capital punishment.
3775| Death penalty|conclusion|"The punishment principle of an ""eye for an eye"" is debunked."
3775| Death penalty|premise|"""Fact: Only God or an omniscient being could determine that; Jesus argued against ""an eye for an eye."
3776| Death penalty|conclusion|Proportional justice risks justifying extreme punishment such as torture.
3776| Death penalty|premise|"If the death penalty is considered a ""proportional"" punishment for someone who commits 1 murder, wouldn't we need a harsher sentence for a person that tortures and murders 10 people? If proportionality is the model, we might have to torture criminals in order to exert sufficient punishment."
3777| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty is merely a vehicle for vengeance.
3777| Death penalty|premise|Harry Lee Anstead, Florida Supreme Court Justice, dissenting from a ruling that upheld the constitutionality of the electric chair.
3778| Death penalty|conclusion|"Murderers might ""deserve"" death, but decency requires mercy."
3778| Death penalty|premise|"""Opponents of the death penalty should be emphatic that relative to what is 'deserved' -- that is, to what those who have committed murder have reason to claim from their society -- there are many who 'deserve' to die."
3779| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty does not advance any social objective.
3779| Death penalty|premise|P.
3780| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is compassionate to the victims.
3780| Death penalty|premise|"""It is up to the law to speak for all grief-stricken survivors confronted with the butchery of someone near and dear."
3781| Death penalty|conclusion|The executed are not deprived of everything.
3781| Death penalty|premise|Capital punishment could only be the severest and most horrific punishment if it was able to deprive the executed of their souls and their after lives.
3782| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment best prepares an evil soul for the after life.
3782| Death penalty|premise|Some argue that capital punishment is something like a spiritual medicine in the sense that it saves a man's soul from an evil life on earth.
3783| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty best fosters repentance.
3783| Death penalty|premise|"""Death can actually be a peaceful and spiritually enlightening experience."
3784| Death penalty|conclusion|Death is more compassionate than life in prison.
3784| Death penalty|premise|"Patrick Henry: - ""Is life so dear."
3785| Death penalty|conclusion|The state does not honor the victim by emulating the murderer.
3785| Death penalty|premise|William Brennan, former U.
3786| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is void of compassion.
3786| Death penalty|premise|"""He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first."
3787| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment does not allow for repenting as life imprisonment does.
3787| Death penalty|premise|John Paul II was one of the strongest advocates of life without parole over capital punishment, and applied the above rationale.
3788| Death penalty|conclusion|Opposition to executions is not about sympathizing with murderers.
3788| Death penalty|premise|"""Opposition to the death penalty does not arise from misplaced sympathy for convicted murderers."
3789| Death penalty|conclusion|Only love can conquer hatred and murderous acts.
3789| Death penalty|premise|Hector Black, whose daughter Patricia was murdered in Atlanta, Georgia in 2000, Victim Impact Statement delivered before the Fulton County (Georgia) Superior court, January 2002.
3790| Death penalty|conclusion|Unquestioned guilt does not carry risk of wrongful execution.
3790| Death penalty|premise|There is often no doubt of the guilt of an individual.
3791| Death penalty|conclusion|Mistaken convictions have not translated into wrongful executions.
3791| Death penalty|premise|"""Several myths about the death penalty have been reported but continue to be debunked upon closer examination."
3792| Death penalty|conclusion|Some risk of executing the innocent must be tolerated.
3792| Death penalty|premise|G.
3793| Death penalty|conclusion|DNA testing increases assurances of guilt.
3793| Death penalty|premise|Some argue that DNA testing has revealed the innocence of some that have been on Death Row, believing it indicates that the system is flawed.
3794| Death penalty|conclusion|Wrongful convictions can be fixed with better prosecutors.
3794| Death penalty|premise|"""American media, already biased against capital punishment, made a sensation of stories from Chicago about wrongful prosecution."
3795| Death penalty|conclusion|Exoneration from death row is not proof of innocence.
3795| Death penalty|premise|When people are let out of death row, it is often because re-consideration found that there was not sufficient proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
3796| Death penalty|conclusion|Due process is all that is required, even if it risks wrongful execution.
3796| Death penalty|premise|The law does require only due process to justify the execution of the orders of a conviction.
3797| Death penalty|conclusion|Wrongful convictions do not mean that the system is wrong.
3797| Death penalty|premise|It is true that occasionally people are wrongly executed under the capital punishment.
3798| Death penalty|conclusion|Risk of executing innocent people undermines death penalty.
3798| Death penalty|premise|Since 1973, 123 in 25 US states have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence.
3799| Death penalty|conclusion|Wrongful executions cannot be corrected, violating due process.
3799| Death penalty|premise|"""DISPLAYING ABSTRACT - Judge Jed S Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan discusses novel legal argument against capital punishment which he developed while overseeing death penalty case; interview; his 2002 ruling pointed to increasing number of DNA exonerations and wondered whether death penalty violates due process because executed prisoners cannot pursue claims of innocence."
3800| Death penalty|conclusion|Individuals are executed on murder charges whom deserved manslaughter.
3800| Death penalty|premise|"""The person convicted of the murder may have actually killed the victim and may even admit having done so but does not agree that the killing was murder."
3806| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions give solace to families.
3806| Death penalty|premise|"""The families of murder victims do not stop mourning when the killer dies, but for many, there is indeed a measure of solace in knowing that the monster who destroyed their loved one will never hurt anyone again."
3807| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions take vengeance out of hands of loved ones.
3807| Death penalty|premise|"Jeff Jacoby - ""It is up to the law to speak to them-to speak for all grief-stricken survivors confronted with the butchery of someone near and dear."
3808| Death penalty|conclusion|Loved ones should not have to support a killer in prison.
3808| Death penalty|premise|Take, for example, a murderer who took the life of a teenager.
3809| Death penalty|conclusion|Can any one say that the people who hit the twin towers should be let free.
3809| Death penalty|premise|Punishment is to create fear among the likes who are in line to do this kind of criminal acts.
3810| Death penalty|conclusion|"Capital punishment does not bring ""closure"" to families."
3810| Death penalty|premise|Larry Fitzgerald, Spokeswoman for Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
3811| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty does not bring back a loved one.
3811| Death penalty|premise|Sharon Borcyzewski, whose daughter was murdered in 1997, Arizona Republic, 12 Apr.
3812| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty does not honor the memory of a loved one.
3812| Death penalty|premise|Jennifer Bishop, whose sister Nancy Bishop Langert and her husband Richard Langert were murdered in 1990.
3813| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty harms the family of the executed.
3813| Death penalty|premise|"Theodore Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography - ""almost any criminal, however brutal, has usually some person, often a person whom he has greatly wronged, who will plead for him."
3814| Death penalty|conclusion|It is acceptable to give a person the job of executing another.
3814| Death penalty|premise|Some argue that it is cruel to delegate the task of execution; however, it is perfectly acceptable if the executioner opted for the job.
3815| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is not barbaric.
3815| Death penalty|premise|"""Why is it barbaric to require that one who violently steals the life of an innocent (or 168 innocents) not be allowed to keep his own? Where is the moral tradition that prescribes life for mass-murderers? How can it be civilizing to tell the world's worst people that no matter no matter how many victims they butcher, no matter what cruelty they inflict on others, the worst that will happen to them is that they will go to prison? Those are questions that abolitionists never answer."
3816| Death penalty|conclusion|Modern states regulate executions, unlike barbaric executions elsewhere.
3816| Death penalty|premise|"""The arbitrary use of capital punishment in totalitarian societies argues for ensuring that government never abuses this power; it does not argue against the principle of capital punishment, which, in a free society, is applied justly under the rule of law."
3818| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty is uncharacteristic of a decent society.
3818| Death penalty|premise|Abe Fortas, former U.
3819| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions characterize oppressive, undemocratic countries.
3819| Death penalty|premise|deathpenalty.
3820| Death penalty|conclusion|Killing in any form victimizes all of humankind.
3820| Death penalty|premise|"""All mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated."
3821| Death penalty|conclusion|An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
3821| Death penalty|premise|Mahatma Ghandi.
3822| Death penalty|conclusion|Society is judged by how it treats prisoners.
3822| Death penalty|premise|"Oscar Wilde - ""One is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the wicked have committed, but by the punishment that the good have inflicted."
3823| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment has a deterrent effect on criminal activities.
3823| Death penalty|premise|As a deterrent to others, it depends on how effectively the death penalty is applied; in the USA where less than 1% of murderers are executed, it is difficult to assess the true effect of deterrence.
3824| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is 100% effective in preventing a murderer from killing again.
3824| Death penalty|premise|There are many instances in which released, paroled, or escaped murderers have gone on to kill again.
3825| Death penalty|conclusion|Criminals fear death and the death penalty.
3825| Death penalty|premise|Abolitionists also hold the notion that criminals do not fear death because they do not take time to think about the consequences of their acts.
3826| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty helps protect inmates and prison guards.
3826| Death penalty|premise|Life in prison without parole does not protect everyone from a murderer.
3827| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty deters crime only if it is a certainty.
3827| Death penalty|premise|When the death penalty is a 100% assured punishment for certain crimes, it has a strong deterrent effect.
3828| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty is a just means of protecting society.
3828| Death penalty|premise|"""The legitimate role of government involves the protection of life, liberty and property."
3829| Death penalty|conclusion|Deterrence is not a necessary pillar of the case for the death penalty.
3829| Death penalty|premise|"""Death penalty opponents love to assume that the principal purpose for capital punishment is deterrence, possibly realizing it is a perfect straw argument."
3830| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions punish the guilty so can't encourage killing the innocent.
3830| Death penalty|premise|"""If capital punishment teaches that it's permissible to kill, do prison sentences teach that it's permissible to hold someone against his will, and do fines teach that it's permissible to steal? In actuality, this fallacy confuses killing the innocent with punishing the guilty."
3831| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment protects more innocents than it does accidentally take the life of innocent convicts.
3831| Death penalty|premise|While it is possible that an innocent person may be executed through capital punishment, more innocent people have been killed by released, paroled or escaped murderers than innocent people executed.
3832| Death penalty|conclusion|Deterrent of capital punishment varies across the states.
3832| Death penalty|premise|"""on average, the states where capital punishment deters murder execute many more people than do the states where capital punishment incites crime or has no effect."
3835| Death penalty|conclusion|Life in prison deters crime/murder as well as the death penalty.
3835| Death penalty|premise|"""The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains it in these words: If 'non-lethal means such as life without parole are sufficient to defend and protect people’s safety from the aggressor i."
3836| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment does not deter crime.
3836| Death penalty|premise|"""These new studies that claim a new evidence supports the conclusion that capital punishment has a positive deterrent effect are fraught with technical and conceptual errors: inappropriate methods of statistical analysis, failures to consider all the relevant factors that drive murder rates, missing data on key variables in key states, the tyranny of a few outlier states and years, and the absence of any direct test of deterrence."
3837| Death penalty|conclusion|"""Deterrent-effect"" of executions is too controversial to justify policy."
3837| Death penalty|premise|It is not proper to conclude that more executions cause higher crime rates with the limited information available.
3838| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions have a brutalizing social effect that can increase crime.
3838| Death penalty|premise|"Capital punishment has a ""brutalizing effect"" that increases the willingness of criminals to take life."
3839| Death penalty|conclusion|Higher execution rates may actually increase violent crime rates.
3839| Death penalty|premise|California averaged 6 executions a year from 1952 to 1967, and had twice the murder rate than the period from 1968 until 1991 when there were no executions.
3840| Death penalty|conclusion|The ends  should not justify means .
3840| Death penalty|premise|It is unacceptable to justify capital punishment on the idea that it will produce a desirable social end, such deterrence.
3841| Death penalty|conclusion|Using death penalty to fight crimes distracts from underlying problems.
3841| Death penalty|premise|"""Reliance on the death penalty obscures the true causes of crime and distracts attention from the social measures that effectively contribute to its control."
3842| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty denies the opportunity to study murderers to prevent future ones.
3842| Death penalty|premise|It is important that scientists be able to study murderers to determine what drives them to perform such heinous acts.
3843| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions contradict strategy of sensitivity to urban neighborhoods.
3843| Death penalty|premise|Daniel F.
3844| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment should be based on principle, not implementation.
3844| Death penalty|premise|Some of the main criticisms of capital punishment are that innocent convicts may be executed and that the form of execution may be faulty and cause the convict excessive pain.
3845| Death penalty|conclusion|Race is not a significant factor in capital punishment cases.
3845| Death penalty|premise|"""The issue of race has been cited by critics, who complain that minorities are unfairly chosen for death sentences."
3846| Death penalty|conclusion|Any discrimination in capital punishment cases can be corrected.
3846| Death penalty|premise|Instances of discrimination in capital punishment cases does not mean capital punishment is wrong.
3847| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is too often the decision of a single authority.
3847| Death penalty|premise|Because Capital Punishment is resolute and irreconcilable, its application is either reserved for extremities, or for judicial statements regarding the severity of the law concerned.
3848| Death penalty|conclusion|The death penalty is often motivated by discrimination.
3848| Death penalty|premise|Steward F.
3849| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is excercised irregularly and arbitrarily.
3849| Death penalty|premise|"""When a country of over 200 million people inflicts an unusually severe punishment no more than 50 times a year, the inference is strong that the punishment is not being regularly and fairly applied."
3850| Death penalty|conclusion|The poor are unfairly vulnerable to capital punishment.
3850| Death penalty|premise|The poor are less able to afford a good lawyer that will defend their interests.
3851| Death penalty|conclusion|Overburdened courts cut-corners on death penalty cases.
3851| Death penalty|premise|Stephen Reinhardt, U.
3852| Death penalty|conclusion|Public calls for capital punishment must be met to uphold justice.
3852| Death penalty|premise|If a public demands capital punishment, and yet a government does not deliver it, the public will likely feel that justice has not been served, which is highly socially damaging.
3853| Death penalty|conclusion|Rejecting calls for capital punishment risks inciting vigilante justice.
3853| Death penalty|premise|If the public will for capital punishment is consistently rejected by a government, elements of the public may feel that they need to uphold justice themselves, leading to vigilante justice.
3854| Death penalty|conclusion|Death penalty popular internationally.
3854| Death penalty|premise|Joshua Micah Marshall.
3855| Death penalty|conclusion|Public opinion is not necessarily right.
3855| Death penalty|premise|OK.
3856| Death penalty|conclusion|Public opinion should not determine justice.
3856| Death penalty|premise|Justice is not supposed to be up to public opinion.
3857| Death penalty|conclusion|National hysteria can lead to unjust convictions and execution.
3857| Death penalty|premise|As with the famous case of the Rosenburgs, capital punishment is sometimes carried out in response to national hysteria.
3858| Death penalty|conclusion|Executions are no more costly than life in prison.
3858| Death penalty|premise|"""I have heard the death penalty is too costly, that life without parole is cheaper."
3859| Death penalty|conclusion|Costs of capital punishment are irrelevant to justice.
3859| Death penalty|premise|"""It doesn't matter what it costs."
3860| Death penalty|conclusion|Opponents of capital punishment are responsible for high costs.
3860| Death penalty|premise|Opponents of the death penalty prefer to ignore the fact that they themselves are responsible for its high costs, by causing a never-ending succession of appeals.
3861| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment relieves strains on over-populated prisons.
3861| Death penalty|premise|Prisons in many countries are over-crowded and under-funded, and this problem is made worse by life sentences or delayed death sentences for murderers.
3863| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment costs more than life without parole.
3863| Death penalty|premise|"""Considerable delay in carrying out the death sentence is unavoidable, given the procedural safeguards required by the courts in capital cases."
3864| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment wastes time and energy and burdens courts.
3864| Death penalty|premise|"""Capital punishment wastes resources."
3865| Death penalty|conclusion|Opponents of the death penalty are not to blame for the costs.
3865| Death penalty|premise|Capital cases cost more on average than housing a criminal for life because criminals are motivated to make frivolous appeals that delay their execution.
3866| Death penalty|conclusion|There is no such thing as a frivolous appeal of the death penalty.
3866| Death penalty|premise|No criminal wants to die and any attempt to save a persons life can not be deemed frivolous, nor inappropriate simply on account of the costs.
3867| Death penalty|conclusion|The executed guilty cannot be equated with aborted unborn innocent.
3867| Death penalty|premise|"""A related fallacy is that the pro-lifer who defends the right to life of an unborn baby in the mother's womb, but who does not defend the right to life of a convicted murderer on death row, is being morally inconsistent."
3868| Death penalty|conclusion|Pro-life anti-abortionists inconsistently support the death penalty.
3868| Death penalty|premise|How can you be pro-life in one instance (abortion) and pro-death in another instance (death penalty)? This is a very common position of many conservatives, and is inconsistent.
3869| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is reserved for those beyond rehabilitation.
3869| Death penalty|premise|Some individuals are simply evil.
3870| Death penalty|conclusion|By executing criminals society rules out the possibility of rehabilitation and productivity.
3870| Death penalty|premise|Killers may repent of their crime, serve a sentence as punishment, and emerge as a reformed and useful member of society.
3871| Death penalty|conclusion|Universal Declaration of Human Rights allows for death penalty.
3871| Death penalty|premise|"""Abolitionists interpret from Article 3 in that Universal Declaration of Human Rights to proclaim each person's right to protection from deprivation of life, especially murderers! And they also point to Article 5, which states that no one shall be subjected to cruel or degrading punishment."
3872| Death penalty|conclusion|United Nations opposes the death penalty.
3872| Death penalty|premise|Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations.
3873| Death penalty|conclusion|The European Union opposes the death penalty.
3873| Death penalty|premise|Brian Cowen, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Politics, 4/22/2004.
3874| Death penalty|conclusion|5th amendment of US Constitution allows for executions.
3874| Death penalty|premise|"It states: ""No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
3875| Death penalty|conclusion|US Founding Fathers approved of death penalty.
3875| Death penalty|premise|"""I would imagine that the Founding Fathers could not have conceived of a world or nation without capital punishment."
3876| Death penalty|conclusion|Capital punishment is supported by the Bible.
3876| Death penalty|premise|There are many passages in the Bible that provide direct support to capital punishment.
3879| Death penalty|conclusion|"Thou shall not kill"" means ""thou shall not murder."
3879| Death penalty|premise|"""The commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill,' has been a source of great confusion."
3880| Death penalty|conclusion|"The expression an ""eye for an eye"" is a prescription for proportional justice and capital punishment."
3880| Death penalty|premise|"""The term 'an eye for an eye' in the scriptures, is not a directive for authority to seek vigilante vengeance, nor necessarily a mandate to recompense a literal eye-for-eye."
3881| Death penalty|conclusion|"Gen. 9.6, ""He who sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed"", helps justify capital punishment."
3881| Death penalty|premise|"""Since biblical times, the death penalty has been deemed as a just punishment for capital offenses."
3884| Death penalty|conclusion|Religious arguments are irrelevant to the legality of Capital Punishment.
3884| Death penalty|premise|The state cannot utilize religious arguments in interpreting the appropriateness of capital punishment.
3885| Death penalty|conclusion|Bible does not support the death penalty.
3885| Death penalty|premise|"Deuteronomy (30:19): ""I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live""."
3888| Death penalty|conclusion|The Catholic Church has long opposed the death penalty.
3888| Death penalty|premise|While complex, the teaching of the Universal Church is clear.
3889| Death penalty|conclusion|Most Catholics now reject the death penalty.
3889| Death penalty|premise|"""Catholic support for the use of the death penalty has dropped significantly—from over 70% of Catholics in the late 1990s to now less than half (48%)."
3890| Death penalty|conclusion|"Bible's ""an eye for an eye"" does not support death penalty."
3890| Death penalty|premise|"""In spite of a common assumption to the contrary, 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,' does not give justification for the imposing of the penalty of death."
3893| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debaters are able to see both sides of a coin.
3893| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Debating teaches people to look at both sides of a problem, thus debaters have this skill usually more developed than other people (and are able to find positives even there where the others give up).
3894| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debaters can approach problems from many different angles.
3894| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Not only can debaters look at positives or negatives, but they are also able to analyze situations from many perspectives, which in turn benefits them as well as others.

3896| Debaters make better spouses|premise|This means that debaters are able to come up with solutions, instead of new fights.
3897| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debating is not about solving problems, quite the contrary.
3897| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Most debaters tend to research the topics given as much as possible, thus making it harder for themselves to finally come to a conclusion (as every good debater is able to argue both for and against any motion).
3898| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debaters´ way of thinking is too complicated.
3898| Debaters make better spouses|premise|In a debate, complex analysis is usually an advantage.
3899| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Solving crises has nothing to do with debating.
3899| Debaters make better spouses|premise|There is no correlation between one's ability to solve crises and skills acquired through debate experience, as debate is a competition, not a row that would be supposed to come to a conclusion.
3900| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|"Debaters need the feeling that they ""won""."
3900| Debaters make better spouses|premise|"Instead of analyzing properly what the pros and cons are, debaters tend to stress only those points that can make them seem as the ""winners"" or the row."
3901| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Self-confidence and ambitiousness is the way to go.
3901| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Modern world needs innovative people who know what they stand for, and why.

3903| Debaters make better spouses|premise|"Imagine a debater's response to a wedding day's (in)famous question ""Do you take this man/woman as your lawfully wedded husband/wife?""."
3904| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debate helps to build up self-confidence.
3904| Debaters make better spouses|premise|It can be argued that, in general, debaters are more self-confident than their peers, because public speaking helps them discover not only their weaknesses, but also their strengths.
3905| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debate enhances cooperation.
3905| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Debating on teams effectively enhances communication and cooperation among people, as they have to come together in order to come up with proper arguments and strategy for each and every debate.
3906| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debate enhances tolerance.
3906| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Given that debaters participate at many international debate competitions, they get to know a lot of people of different ethnicity, religious belief, etc.
3907| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debaters tend to be arrogant.
3907| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Most debaters expect their peers to know a lot about current affairs (just as they themselves do), which could cause misunderstandings.
3908| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Debate tournaments are not just about debating.
3908| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Sadly, debate tournaments can be also seen as an opportunity to get drunk with one´s friends, because parents are far away - and tournament´s organizers do not (usually) care.
3909| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Fierce competition harms relationships.
3909| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Debate is based on competition, however, sometimes this gets out of control.
3910| Debaters make better spouses|conclusion|Competitive debating is very stressful.
3910| Debaters make better spouses|premise|Debating as such takes up a lot of time (research, tournaments, sessions with trainers.

3914| Debate vs. dialogue|premise|It might create a choice between two alternatives when no such choice exists or when multiple unconsidered alternatives exist.
3915| Debate vs. dialogue|conclusion|"Debate participants often deploy tactics of arguing any point just to ""win""."
3915| Debate vs. dialogue|premise|"This isn't about the ""truth"" or resolution, but about winning and often ego."
3916| Debate vs. dialogue|conclusion|A debate between two alternatives does not inherently imply that there are only two alternatives to choose from.
3916| Debate vs. dialogue|premise|A debate may merely be a comparative investigation between two cases.
3917| Debate vs. dialogue|conclusion|If a false dichotomy is created, this is only an issue of the poor implementation of a debate.
3917| Debate vs. dialogue|premise|A resolution or yes/no question can and should be created to reflect a legitimate choice present in society.
3918| Debate vs. dialogue|conclusion|"Debate can lead to ""false dichotomies""."

4189| Direct democracy|premise|As  argue, voters do not necessarily need perfect information to make reasonable decisions.
4190| Direct democracy|conclusion|Citizens are best at determining their own interests.
4190| Direct democracy|premise|While politicians try to determine what's in the best interests of citizens, citizens themselves are better at making these kinds of determinations.

4192| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy encourages citizens to educate themselves.
4192| Direct democracy|premise|It is certainly true that direct democracy requires that citizens participate actively in the political process and that they inform themselves on the issues surrounding them.
4193| Direct democracy|conclusion|Being part of the process is a requirement in a democracy.
4193| Direct democracy|premise|Citizens identify themselves more closely with the government policies when they are allowed to cast votes.
4194| Direct democracy|conclusion|Nothing wrong about NIMBYism through initiatives.
4194| Direct democracy|premise|The people are right when they oppose a policy in their neighbourhood that would worsen their quality of life.
4195| Direct democracy|conclusion|Citizens are not informed enough to make good policy.
4195| Direct democracy|premise|"""a small minority of the total number of the voters and human nature being what it is probably a large proportion of the signers have not got the slightest knowledge of what they signed It is notorious that men can be easily persuaded to sign petitions for almost anything."
4196| Direct democracy|conclusion|Voters tend to be self-centered in a direct democracy.
4196| Direct democracy|premise|Voters tend to look after their self-interests, rather than the bigger picture of what needs doing.
4197| Direct democracy|conclusion|Voters are too apathetic to make good laws.
4197| Direct democracy|premise|The average voter may not be interested in politics and therefore may not participate.
4198| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy fosters emotional decision-making.
4198| Direct democracy|premise|When presented with a single yes/no question, usually without any information on the issue at hand, people tend to make spur-of-the-moment decisions based on emotions, driven by anger, fear and hatred.
4199| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy disables unpopular but necessary decisions.
4199| Direct democracy|premise|The problem with direct democracy is that the general public can hardly ever think about the issues at hand in the long-term.
4200| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy often results in radical measures.
4200| Direct democracy|premise|"""There seems to be little capacity for discrimination in Direct Democracy."
4201| Direct democracy|conclusion|Having to vote on every issue is a burden on citizens.
4201| Direct democracy|premise|One con of direct democracy is that the people have to vote on EVERY issue, which would take time away from your day.
4202| Direct democracy|conclusion|Rep democracy produces un-representative leaders.
4202| Direct democracy|premise|Individuals elected to office in a representative democracy tend not to be demographically representative of their constituency.
4203| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy helps check political class.
4203| Direct democracy|premise|Politicians are the victims of many things: be it their selfish interest (or bias) which may result in rearing to corruption, or just the pressure that rich and well-organized interest groups exert to persuade the politician that it is in his electorate's interest to pass (or vote down) the legislature in a move which is in all actuality detrimental to the majority of his voters (see a book by Fareed Zakaria Illiberal Democracy Home and Abroad).
4204| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy is too slow and inefficient.
4204| Direct democracy|premise|Another objection to direct democracy is that of practicality and efficiency.
4205| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy makes politicians timid and ineffective.

4209| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy promotes democratic principles.
4209| Direct democracy|premise|"Initiatives, recalls, and referenda are the ultimate opportunity to the citizens to say ""Hang on a minute, this is not in my interest at all"", and for citizens to directly shape the policies that affect them."
4210| Direct democracy|conclusion|Political parties are unfortunate consequence of rep. democracy.
4210| Direct democracy|premise|"The formation of political parties is considered by some to be a ""necessary evil"" of representative democracy, where combined resources are often needed to get candidates elected."
4211| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy checks the tendency toward package deals.
4211| Direct democracy|premise|Given that voters decide on single issues instead of a package of policies that might not fully be in the voters' interests, the people are freer to choose what is the best for them.
4212| Direct democracy|conclusion|"Direct democracy over-simplifies policies to a ""yes/no"" vote."
4212| Direct democracy|premise|In a representative democracy, laws in the parliamentary bodies undergo a lot of scrutiny, repeated rewritings, curbings, mitigations and other checks that in the end, the law that is passed is usually okay on principle with most of the representatives.
4213| Direct democracy|conclusion|Referenda devalue role of legislative bodies.
4213| Direct democracy|premise|"""Teach Yourself: Politics"", Peter Joyce): ""In some countries (such as France) they were deliberately introduced to weaken the power of parliament."
4214| Direct democracy|conclusion|Campaigns for ballot measures often have unfair resource advantages.
4214| Direct democracy|premise|"""Competing groups in a referendum do not necessarily possess equality in the resources which they have at their disposal and this may give one side an unfair advantage over the other in putting its case across to the electorate."
4215| Direct democracy|conclusion|Referenda are often a malignant form of protestation.
4215| Direct democracy|premise|As the post-referendum survey in Ireland shows, one of the reasons people voted against the Lisbon Treaty was that some of them saw it as a good way to protest against the government's policies (instead of a reason one might expect - that they were against the treaty itself).
4216| Direct democracy|conclusion|Rep democracy is less accountabile than direct democracy.
4216| Direct democracy|premise|Once elected, representatives are free to act as they please.
4217| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy avoids appointment of unaccountable officials.
4217| Direct democracy|premise|Elected individuals frequently appoint people to high positions based on their mutual loyalty, as opposed to their competence.
4218| Direct democracy|conclusion|Direct democracy lacks accountability of decision-making.

4224| Direct democracy|conclusion|Unorganized minorities are vulnerable in direct democracy.
4224| Direct democracy|premise|"""Not only is the Initiative and Referendum a game of dice against the unorganized majority but it is a cruel handicap and an eternal danger to unorganized minorities who are dumb and helpless against others of their fellow citizens who are organized and are possibly not as considerate of the rights of others as they ought to be."
4225| Direct democracy|conclusion|Many founding fathers believed in government by the people.
4225| Direct democracy|premise|"Thomas Jefferson once said: ""Men by their makeup are naturally divided into two camps: those who fear and distrust the people and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of higher classes; and those who identify themselves with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them the safest and most honest, if not always the wisest repository of the public interest."

4232| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague was asked by the United Nations General Assembly to consider the legality of the barrier and in July 2004 it ruled that the security wall was a breach of international laws.
4233| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|There are numerous reasons why the ICJ opinion is not binding for Israel.
4233| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|The opinion of the ICJ is advisory, largely symbolic, and not legally binding.
4234| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The Oslo Accord between Israel and the Palestinians says that disputes must be settled by negotiation, not by unilateral appeal to external bodies.

4237| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|The main priority of Israeli government is the security of its people, as well as the security of Palestinians.
4238| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The Security wall could weaken the Palestinian position at any peace negotiations as it creates new facts on the ground favorable to Israel that will be hard to reverse.
4238| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|It would be harder to object to the wall if it followed the “Green Line” of the 1967 border between Israel and what are now the Occupied Territories.
4239| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The security barrier is only temporary and can therefore not affect any peace negotiations.
4239| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|Israel has made clear that it expects any border settlement to be negotiated with the Palestinians.
4240| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The security wall effectively means the annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel.
4240| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|Palestinian leaders assert the route chosen could lead to almost half of the cultivatable land in the West Bank being annexed.
4241| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The route of the security wall is not based on security considerations, but politics.
4241| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|It is primarily concerned with tying the land around Israeli settlements to Israel.
4242| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The security barrier merely connects Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
4242| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|Civilians in the West Bank settlements deserve as much protection against terrorist attacks as anyone else.
4243| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The security wall hinders the everyday activities of Palestinians.
4243| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|A great number of Palestinians have land or jobs, hospitals and schools on one side of the wall and houses on other side.
4244| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The security barrier reduces violence and tensions and subsequently reduces the need for heavy handed and often violent Israeli responses.
4244| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|Without a wall, the need for patrols, arrests, and sometimes draconian actions by the Israel's is greatly heightened, simply on the basis of the needed security.
4245| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|In time, entry systems will become more routine across the Israeli-Palestinian security border.
4245| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|Life will be better for Palestinians and they won’t have to go through so severe treatment.
4246| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|By carving up the West Bank, Israel is stopping the development of a workable Palestinian state.
4246| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|The barrier and the settlements it protects will ensure that the Palestinian people will remain desperate, and that their government will be unable to control its own territory effectively.
4247| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The Palestinian Authority has to show that it can be trusted to run a viable state before Israel relaxes its security measures.
4247| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|The corruption and ineptitude of Fatah have led to ten years of misrule and increased the people’s poverty.
4248| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|conclusion|The barrier harms Israel’s international image and weakens its support in the USA, a crucial ally.
4248| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|The US has acted to ensure its loan guarantees cannot be used to pay for the wall’s construction.

4249| Dismantling the Israeli security wall|premise|The USA has accepted Israel’s right to build a security barrier and President Bush has also agreed that some Israeli settlements are facts on the ground which need to be respected in any future settlement.
4250| Divided government vs. one-party rule|conclusion|Divided government places a necessary check on ambition.
4250| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|My strong preference for a check and balance on the accumulation of power leads me to hope Republicans salvage a sliver of power from this Democratic tide.

4257| Divided government vs. one-party rule|conclusion|The Supreme Court still checks one-party rule.
4257| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|"""Second, the Democrats do not have the supreme court, and there is no early prospect of a firm Democratic majority on it."
4258| Divided government vs. one-party rule|conclusion|Minority Party always argues for divided government.
4258| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|"""the Republicans did have one-party rule in 2000-2006 and really did have all three branches of government under their control."

4265| Divided government vs. one-party rule|conclusion|One-party rule under Bush administration was a failure.
4265| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|"""a search for policies enacted since 2003 that have enjoyed either substantive success or broad public support yields results that can only be called dispiriting."
4266| Divided government vs. one-party rule|conclusion|Divided government impedes sound governance.
4266| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|"""Since Americans have an innate mistrust of concentrated power, the notion of divided government could gain traction for voters with short memories."

4271| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|"""People who want divided government are afraid of politics."
4272| Divided government vs. one-party rule|conclusion|Divided government is a bad idea when parties are polarized.
4272| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|When there are many centrists in a government, opposing political parties can better come together to reach compromises and take action.
4273| Divided government vs. one-party rule|conclusion|Voters prefer divided government over one-party rule.
4273| Divided government vs. one-party rule|premise|"""The voters like divided government (shorthand for when one party controls the White House and the other controls at least one house of Congress)."

4278| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Sharing Jerusalem is necessary to the peace process.
4278| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""At a recent closed-door gathering of former Israeli and Palestinian negotiators hosted at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution."

4279| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""Palestinians would not consider leaving all of Jerusalem under the control of Israel to be a permanent solution."
4280| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Unconventional division of Jerusalem can break cycle of violence.
4280| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""Sometimes and in some places, conflict is so intractable that all but the most unlikely solutions are fated to fail."
4281| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Dividing Jerusalem would shift the battle lines to the city.
4281| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""Those who give the Palestinians control over the Temple Mount, the ""outlying neighborhood"" next to the Western Wall, will no longer be able to pray in peace at the Wall, or hold Memorial Day ceremonies or induction ceremonies for paratroopers there; nor will they be able to ensure the safety of the president or prime minister should either wish to participate in such ceremonies."
4282| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Jerusalem is too interwoven to be neatly divided.
4282| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""In 2000 President Bill Clinton, as part of a set of ""parameters"" he laid out for ending the conflict, proposed a legal split of the city, with Israel handing the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem over to Palestinian rule."
4283| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Dividing Jerusalem will fail, like all divided cities in history.
4283| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""In the city of Nicosia, for example, they decided to build a wall to separate Turkish and Greek Cypriots, but this failed to solve the economic or political aspects of the conflict between the two peoples."
4284| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Dividing Jerusalem will destroy the city.
4284| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""Yet there is a truth that has yet to be spoken: Any division of Jerusalem will bring about the city's destruction."
4285| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Jerusalem can be shared.
4285| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"It has been a Palestinian position that Jerusalem can ""remain the capital of Israel"" and can ""remain undivided""."
4286| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Sharing Jerusalem is fairest trade-off between competing interests.
4286| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""The basic trade-offs require meeting Israeli needs on security and refugees on the one hand and Palestinian needs on territory and a capital in Arab East Jerusalem on the other."
4287| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Israel misgoverns East Jerusalem.
4287| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""In a Jerusalem telephone book, for example, maps of Arab neighborhoods are blank, like unexplored parts of the Amazon in the 19th century."

4291| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Israel governs Palestinians in Jerusalem well and democratically.
4291| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|Israel governs East Jerusalem as well as it can.
4292| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|The idea that Jerusalem could be shared as opposed to divided or solely Israeli is not practical.
4292| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|If all Jerusalem becomes the capital of both Israel and Palestine, this would create all sorts of potential problems.
4293| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Jerusalem was intended by the UN to be a joint capital.
4293| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"The League of Nations and United Nations initially established Jerusalem as an ""international"" city."
4294| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Countries do not recognize Jerusalem as Israeli capital.
4294| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|Almost all countries keep their diplomatic missions in Tel-Aviv today and do not consider Jerusalem the official capital of Israel.
4295| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|"1947 Arab invasion invalidated ""international"" status of Jerusalem."
4295| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"""the Arab non-acceptance of Resolution 181 and invasion of Israel immediately upon its declaration of statehood essentially reneged the resolution and the creation of an Arab state at the time."
4296| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Dividing Jerusalem will not alienate Jews from their heritage.
4296| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"Dennis Ross writes in the book ""the Missing Peace"", that it is a myth: ""that all of Jerusalem, including the exclusively Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, must remain Israeli lest the division of East Jerusalem rob Israel of its link to its Jewish heritage."
4297| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Sharing Jerusalem is forbidden under Israeli law.
4297| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"In 1980, Israel's parliament, the Knesset, passed the ""Basic Law""."
4298| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|Jerusalem is too important to Jewish identity to be divided.
4298| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|"Ben Gurion explain in 1937, ""for the Jews, the millions of the Jews who do not know the difference between the Sharon or the Jezre'el and the Valley or the difference between Rehavia and the Old City the name Jerusalem means everything."

4299| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|Without peace, it is impossible for Jerusalem to thrive economically as it should.
4300| Dividing Jerusalem|conclusion|A divided Jerusalem would be less viable economically.
4300| Dividing Jerusalem|premise|Dividing a city in two means cutting off commerce between the two sides.
4301| Divorce|conclusion|The idea of lifelong marriage is outdated.
4301| Divorce|premise|This belief arose in ancient times, when life expectancies were much shorter than today, and there was no other way apart from marriage to ensure a secure upbringing for the offspring of a union.
4302| Divorce|conclusion|If marriage comes to lack love and happiness then it should end.
4302| Divorce|premise|There is no point holding on in such a situation for the sake of a principle.
4303| Divorce|conclusion|Marriage is about union and love, both of which are hard to fulfill and need to be continually worked on, rather than abandoned casually.
4303| Divorce|premise|Modern expectations of a perfect marriage are unrealistic, and have been fostered by the entertainment industry’s concept of an ideal relationship.
4304| Divorce|conclusion|Households filled with fighting parents are damaging to children.
4304| Divorce|premise|While divorces may inconvenience the day-to-day lives of children, we also need to consider the repercussions for the children when their parents do not get along.
4305| Divorce|conclusion|It is more damaging for a child to have to suffer the break-up of their parents than to live through a conflicted household marriage.
4305| Divorce|premise|It is very difficult for children to see the two people they love most in the world fall out of love for one-another and break up.
4306| Divorce|conclusion|Separated parents disrupt the day-to-day lives of children.
4306| Divorce|premise|With parents living across town or in different cities, children must accommodate the logistical problems of seeing both of their parents.
4307| Divorce|conclusion|Vows are made only with the best knowledge of the moment.
4307| Divorce|premise|The opposition's argument is a spurious one, as nowadays we regard a promise not as something unchanging and absolute, but as an expression of commitment for the time and the circumstances it was made.
4308| Divorce|conclusion|Divorce devalues the meaning of the vows made at a wedding.
4308| Divorce|premise|as long as you both shall live’.
4309| Divorce|conclusion|Divorce can avoid the problem of adultery.
4309| Divorce|premise|By making divorces faster and easier to obtain, we are reducing the incidence of adultery, both during a marriage and during the course of the divorce proceedings.
4310| Divorce|conclusion|Easier divorces may encourage adultery through the devaluation of the institution of marriage.
4310| Divorce|premise|The debate is not about mere sexual gratification, but about a deeper, life-long commitment.
4311| National DNA database|conclusion|Databasing only the DNA of the arrested is too arbitrary.
4311| National DNA database|premise|"""The problem with the government's approach is that it uses the criterion of whether you happen to have been arrested – even for a fairly trivial offence."
4312| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA database should only be subjected to former criminals.
4312| National DNA database|premise|DNA databasing only of the arrested is justified.
4313| National DNA database|conclusion|General statements against DNA databases.
4313| National DNA database|premise|"A judge from the European Court of Human rights ruled in a 2008 court case involving two innocent British men whose DNA was retained by police that DNA databases ""could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society""."
4314| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA databasing is invaluable technology for solving crimes.
4314| National DNA database|premise|"""DNA is an invaluable technology in solving serious crime."
4315| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA detection may not always be accurate.
4315| National DNA database|premise|There is a significant portion of crimes where no DNA data has been found.
4316| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA databasing protects citizens/rights by imprisoning criminals.
4316| National DNA database|premise|One of the most important obligations of government is, indeed, to protect the rights of citizens.
4317| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA database does not impede private acts of individuals.
4317| National DNA database|premise|While the main argument against a national DNA database is that it violates the right to privacy, this argument does not hold up well to scrutiny.
4318| National DNA database|conclusion|One thing for authority, others for civilians.
4318| National DNA database|premise|It's one thing for the police authority to have access to a vast database of every civilians' DNA, but it's quite another for civilians to have the access.
4319| National DNA database|conclusion|A DNA database for everyone will be too intrusive.
4319| National DNA database|premise|A DNA database should only be subjected to former criminals who have been convicted of a crime.
4320| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA databases could expose personal information in unanticipated ways.
4320| National DNA database|premise|"Professor Stephen Bain, a member of the national DNA database strategy board: ""If the information about you is exposed due to illegal or perhaps even legalised use of the database, in a way that is not currently anticipated, then it's a very difficult situation."
4321| National DNA database|conclusion|No realistic ways in which government would abuse DNA database.
4321| National DNA database|premise|"""why are civil libertarians so scared of a national DNA database? How, exactly, do they think that state officials are going to use such a database to abuse their powers? After all, the fact that someone has access to a genetic database coded in 1's and 0's on a computer does not mean that they can actually create the DNA in a test tube and, perhaps, plant it somewhere."
4322| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA database would make government/police abuses more difficult.
4322| National DNA database|premise|"""a national DNA database would make it far more difficult for those with power to abuse it."
4323| National DNA database|conclusion|Only criminals should worry about their DNA samples being on file.
4323| National DNA database|premise|"""I had my DNA sampled, they took a cheek swab from me."
4324| National DNA database|conclusion|Weapons against people opposing the government.
4324| National DNA database|premise|Since the government will obviously be in control of the DNA database, they will be surely granted access to information regarding every citizen in the country.
4325| National DNA database|conclusion|Governments can and do abuse data.
4325| National DNA database|premise|We don't need to speculate about whether DNA databases could be abused or not, because in the UK the government and its agencies have already demonstrated very convincingly and repeatedly that they are not able to keep our data secure.
4326| National DNA database|conclusion|If you're innocent, you should be worried.
4326| National DNA database|premise|DNA information is extremely personal and valuable - whether it gets into the hands of criminals or insurance companies.
4327| National DNA database|conclusion|National DNA database would aid medical research/innovation.
4327| National DNA database|premise|"""A national DNA database would allow medical scientists to increase vastly their understanding of the roles that genes play when it comes to every disease that there is - including those to do with ageing and mental health functioning."
4328| National DNA database|conclusion|DNA databases reduce crime and related expenditures.
4328| National DNA database|premise|"""The reduction in crime that a national DNA database would bring about would also save so many resources."
4330| National DNA database|conclusion|The taxpayers are funding it.
4330| National DNA database|premise|It would cost a lot of tax payers money to make and to test everyone.
4331| DNA database of criminals|conclusion|DNA fingerprinting techniques have considerable advantages over conventional means of forensic crime detection.
4331| DNA database of criminals|premise|Conventional fingerprints attach only to hard surfaces, can be smeared, or avoided by the use of gloves.
4332| DNA database of criminals|conclusion|A DNA database would not be intended to replace conventional criminal investigation.
4332| DNA database of criminals|premise|The database ought to identify the potential suspects, each of whom can then be investigated by more conventional means.
4333| DNA database of criminals|conclusion|The increased use of DNA evidence will minimize the risk of future wrongful convictions.
4333| DNA database of criminals|premise|An FBI study indicates that since 1989 DNA evidence has excluded the primary candidate in 25% of sexual assault cases.
4334| DNA database of criminals|conclusion|Although DNA detection might have advantages over fingerprint dusting, the test is nevertheless fallible.
4334| DNA database of criminals|premise|Environmental factors at the crime scene such as heat, sunlight, or bacteria can corrupt any genetic data.
4335| DNA database of criminals|conclusion|There is a serious risk that genetic evidence will be used to the exclusion of material that might prove the innocence of the suspect.
4335| DNA database of criminals|premise|It is likely that more crimes will be prosecuted on account of largely circumstantial evidence.
4336| DNA database of criminals|conclusion|The database is immaterial to the acquittal or exclusion of non-offenders.
4336| DNA database of criminals|premise|Where a primary suspect has been identified, a DNA profile ought to be created and compared to the crime scene data.

4417| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|Guilt should be the primary criteria for trials, not double jeopardy considerations.
4417| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|The problem with the ‘double jeopardy’ rule is that people who are clearly guilty - because new evidence has emerged, because they’ve confessed - are not being punished for crimes they have committed.
4418| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|This law protects evil doers.
4418| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|Who are we protecting with this rule? People who were wrongly acquitted, as displayed by later blatant and obvious proof of guilt.
4420| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|It's more important that a justice system provide is a clear result.
4420| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|The proposition may argue that this will only apply to ‘exceptional’ cases - but the truth is that every case is potentially subject to revisitation, and closure is never available - not to the acquitted accused, not to victims, not to relatives.
4421| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|"Banning ""double jeopardy"" laws would help protect innocent people from continual prosecution."
4421| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|The double jeopardy rule protects everyone from the danger of constant harassment from the state.
4422| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|‘Guilt’ is not verifiable in the same way in a second trial.
4422| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|When asked ‘what did you see?’ a witness is likely to reply, ‘what did I say last time?'.
4423| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|When crimes goes unpunished by double jeopardy laws, it undermines our faith in the justice system.
4423| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|Our bargain with the state entails the state’s right to judge the individual because the state protects the individual: if our attackers roam the streets because an arbitrary legal rule exempts them from prosecution despite clear guilt, then that system has broken down.
4424| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|All the rules and laws that protect the accused at the first trial will be in place at a second.
4424| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|The Presumption of innocence, proof beyond reasonable doubt, the right to a fair hearing and competent counsel, the judge’s duty to appropriately direct the jury, etc.
4425| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|The judicial system is unlikely to be overwhelmed with retrials.
4425| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|Much of the current push for the end of the double jeopardy rule comes from the widespread use of DNA testing, which has allowed many old cases to be revisited with compelling new evidence of guilt or innocence.
4426| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|The rule of law will actually come to mean less if it exists in a perpetual state of potential overturn.
4426| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|We need to be protected from the state in other ways, too - from the vindictive or obsessed policeman that will pursue a case because he ‘knows’ the accused, properly acquitted in a court of law, to be guilty nevertheless.
4427| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|The presumption of innocence will be undermined in a retrial.
4427| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|Juries will know this is a retrial – because evidence will have to be ‘read’ from the first trial where witnesses have died, because notes from ‘last time’ will be available to advocates and the accused, because the legal procedure of the last trial will be subject to discussion in this one.
4428| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|The Police should be able to restrain themselves from over-pursuing an investigation.
4428| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|While it may be possible that the police could continually attempt to overturn rulings if double jeopardy laws were banned, it would not be difficult to regulate police behavior in an appropriate manner on this point.
4429| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|If the ‘double jeopardy’ rule is scrapped, police work will be sloppier.
4429| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|because police detectives will know that the insurance of a second trial exists.
4430| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|New techniques make a reanalysis of evidence possible later on.
4430| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|premise|Vast improvements in the technology of crime-solving have occurred in recent times.
4431| Double Jeopardy Rule, Abolition of|conclusion|The implications of reanalysis should be looked at carefully.

4446| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|premise|If parents have given up a child for adoption for medical reasons, for example, then the feelings of resentment on the part of the child may cause a desire for revenge against one individual.
4449| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|conclusion|There is a strong medical imperative to discover genetic parentage.
4449| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|premise|Increasingly DNA samples will be used to predict and treat genetic diseases, for which information on family medical background will need to be known.
4450| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|conclusion|The idea that disease predictions should be made through knowledge of biological parenthood is wrong.
4450| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|premise|Higher insurance premiums and medical discrimination are likely to result.
4451| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|conclusion|Biological parents would not be threatened by their children knowing their existence, so why would these parents be more likely to perform abortions.
4451| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|premise|The right to know parentage does not equal the right to contact or depend on biological rather than adoptive families, so parents are unlikely to act in these irresponsible ways.
4452| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|conclusion|Parents who do not wish to be known will seek to circumvent a publicly regulated system, meaning a rise in the rates of abandoned children and an unwillingness to adopt them.
4452| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|premise|This would be a very dangerous outcome as children who are abandoned (rather than formally put up for adoption) may well die of exposure or starvation before they are found.
4453| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|conclusion|The right to know paternity is part of the implicit contract that a father supports a family in exchange for knowing the children are his.
4453| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|premise|This has a strong evolutionary base and is an important part of human psychology and culture.
4454| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|conclusion|Such a large number of children are illegitimate that a right to know would cause family disruptions.
4454| Do offspring have a right to know their biological parents?|premise|Recent genetic research estimates that up to 10% of children are illegitimate, brought up by men who believe erroneously that they are the biological father.
4455| DREAM Act|conclusion|"DREAM Act is ""earned citizenship"", not amnesty."
4455| DREAM Act|premise|"""it's not quite right to think of DREAM, a narrowly tailored provision that offers a relatively small group of young people a path to citizenship only if they are able to clear a number or hurdles, as an 'amnesty'."

4477| Driftnet ban|conclusion|"Drifnet ""by-catch"" has a disastrous impact on ocean life."
4477| Driftnet ban|premise|Driftnets indiscriminately ensnare sea creatures in their area.
4478| Driftnet ban|conclusion|By-catch doesn’t need to be a reason to ban driftnets.
4478| Driftnet ban|premise|In fact, when used well, drift-nets can have a minimum of by-catch, and certainly no more than other fishing methods.
4479| Driftnet ban|conclusion|Driftnets can push a targeted species to extinction.
4479| Driftnet ban|premise|Driftnets are so effective that their use actually pushes these species to the brink of extinction.
4480| Driftnet ban|conclusion|The reports of extinction through over-fishing are inconclusive and based on anecdotal evidence.
4480| Driftnet ban|premise|Even if catches have dropped so much, it can have different causes: for example, tuna are a highly mobile species, and maybe they have fled to the high seas where there is a ban on driftnets already.
4481| Driftnet ban|conclusion|Large-scale commercial driftnets are the concern, not local driftnet use.
4481| Driftnet ban|premise|Commercial driftnets were first employed in the 1980s by Japan, Korea and Taiwan.
4482| Driftnet ban|conclusion|Driftnet fishing is a form of subsistence living for many.
4482| Driftnet ban|premise|All talk about biodiversity and poor dolphins and fish is nice, but should be considered against the fact that for many people, driftnet fishing is their only means of subsistence.

4483| Driftnet ban|premise|A country’s Exclusive Economic Zone stretches 200 nautical miles from the coastline.
4484| Driftnet ban|conclusion|There is a ban on the use of driftnets in international waters already.
4484| Driftnet ban|premise|This should be enough: it provides fish with enough “breeding space” to recover from overfishing.

4505| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Drivers licenses to illegal aliens will bring these individuals out from the shadows into the open.
4506| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Post 9/11 fears should not cause the US to deny driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
4506| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|To let the fear of terrorists drive immigration policy in the United States, is to let the terrorist enemy win.
4507| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|It is already very easy for illegals to fake their identity.
4507| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Driver's licenses are not the end-all-be-all of identity in the United States.
4508| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Offering illegal immigrants drivers licenses is a national security threat.
4508| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Many terrorists, including 9/11 terrorists, obtained driver's licenses as a means to perform their acts of terrorism.
4509| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Passport security difficulties are minor and don't justify driver's licenses to illegal aliens.
4509| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Passport security has been substantially improved.
4510| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Illegal immigrant fugitives might be offered driver's licenses.
4510| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Many illegal immigrants are fugitives from their home countries.
4511| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Denying illegal immigrants driver's licenses does not address the problem of illegal immigration.
4511| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|The illegal immigrant problem in the United States cannot be resolved by mass deportation.
4512| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants would help gather important information.
4512| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|A serious part of the illegal immigrant problem is the lack of information on this group of American society.
4513| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Illegal immigrants will not risk deportation to obtain a drivers license.
4513| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|In the United States, there are uncertainties regarding the future of illegal immigrants.
4514| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|It would be wrong to provide illegal aliens an incentive to obtain driver's licenses.
4514| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Any incentive offered to illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses risks being viewed as a reward or concession for illegal behavior.
4515| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Offering driver's licenses to illegal immigrants will incentivize more illegal immigration.
4515| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|A big part of solving the illegal immigration problem is creating dis-incentives for entering the United States.
4516| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|America is capable of enforcing immigration law.
4516| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|If America really wanted to uncover and deport illegal immigrants it could.
4517| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Driver's licenses for illegal immigrants will generally lower insurance costs.
4517| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Because illegal immigrant drivers are a greater risk on the road, and because they do not have insurance, they make it necessary for insurance companies to raise rates for everyone.
4518| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Deporting illegal immigrants would cripple the US economy.
4518| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Some argue that illegal immigrants should be deported, rather than provided legal licenses that further integrate them into society.
4519| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|The costs of providing driver's licenses to millions of illegal immigrants would be very high.
4519| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|While driver's licenses for illegal immigrants may reduce general insurance costs, it will raise costs in other ways.
4520| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Denying illegal immigrants driver's licenses forces DMV employees to become immigration experts.
4520| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Without a driver's license to illegal immigrants scheme, it is necessary for DMV employees to know which documents they can accept as proof of lawful presence and which are faulty.
4521| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|DMV employees would not need to become immigration experts to determine the illegality of an immigrant.
4521| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|While determining illegal immigrant status may be difficult, systems have been created to enable this.
4522| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Some driver's license schemes would make clear possession by illegal immigrants, thus preventing voter fraud.
4522| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Voter fraud is only possible if an illegal alien is able to pretend that they are legal citizens with their driver's license.
4523| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Offering driver's licenses to illegal immigrants increases the risk of voter fraud.
4523| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|The only thing necessary in registering to vote is a driver's license.
4524| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Many US states do not require drivers to prove legal status in order to obtain a driver's license.
4524| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|These states include Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington.
4525| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|Public opinion is irrelevant to legal/constitutional interpretations on providing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
4525| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|There is a strong case that the 14th amendment of the constitution provides illegal immigrants with equal protection under the law, including in regards to the provision of driver's licenses.
4526| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|conclusion|The American public strongly opposes driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.
4526| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|premise|Public opposition to this proposition is a very important fact to consider.
4527| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|In certain circumstances it is better to compromise certain rights in order to uphold other values.
4527| Drug testing in schools|premise|While it can be argued that these tests compromise one's right to privacy, we have to realize that safety and health are much more important.
4528| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Forced drug-testing would violate the principle of innocent until proven guilty.
4528| Drug testing in schools|premise|Most justice systems hold to the notion of innocence until proven guilty.
4529| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Deterring drug use is the main objective of random drug testing.
4529| Drug testing in schools|premise|The purpose of random drug testing is not so much to catch offenders but to prevent all students from offending in the first place.
4530| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Random drug testing will effectively utilize social and peer pressures.
4530| Drug testing in schools|premise|Peer pressure is the primary cause of experimentation with drugs Discouraging drug use amongst athletes, model students etc.
4531| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|There is a clear and present problem with drug use among teenagers in many countries.
4531| Drug testing in schools|premise|Current measures to tackle drugs at the source (i.
4532| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|There are many simple methods of drug testing that are not too invasive.
4532| Drug testing in schools|premise|Urine, hair and breath samples can be used to detect use of most common drugs, especially cannabis, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine or PCP.
4533| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Drug education clearly does not work.
4533| Drug testing in schools|premise|Although young people have enough information about drugs, they carry on ruining their health.
4534| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Random drug tests make the school environment better.
4534| Drug testing in schools|premise|Instead of having students high (or even with worser symptoms), we are moving on to having responsible students aware of the consequences that come with drug usage.
4535| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|There are means of preventing drug use other than obligatory drug tests.
4535| Drug testing in schools|premise|The idea of prevention goes to the root of the drug problem; other methods of deterrence are less invasive, such as encouraging extra-curricular activities, drug education, fostering better parental relations, tackling poverty and safety and so on.
4536| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Forced drug testing will only encourage further rebellion.
4536| Drug testing in schools|premise|Teenagers, especially drug-taking teenagers, are attracted by rebellion and the chance of beating the system.
4537| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Education is the ultimate deterrent, not random testing.
4537| Drug testing in schools|premise|If the prospect of running after dragons is not scary enough, then random drug tests sound almost like fun.
4539| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Responsibility and obligation to protect.
4539| Drug testing in schools|premise|The government has the ultimate responsibility to protect the citizens.
4540| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|The government does not have the right to intervene.
4540| Drug testing in schools|premise|"Schools are supposed to be independent institutions, not some kind of artificially created ""government investigating bureaus""."
4541| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|"""Drugs are wrong and harmful""."
4541| Drug testing in schools|premise|Children have to realize that taking drugs is never OK and that they should not get away with it.
4542| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|Everybody is equal.
4542| Drug testing in schools|premise|"Given that these tests would be random, it shows the ""problematic"" students that we are not picking on them; it is just a matter of luck whether they are tested or not."
4543| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|It is OK to freely investigate.
4543| Drug testing in schools|premise|The real message random drug tests are sending are almost Orwelian.
4545| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|The benefits outweigh the costs.
4545| Drug testing in schools|premise|Due to the fact that these tests act as deterrents and lead to a drug-free school environment and thus a healthier and better society, they are clearly worth the costs.
4546| Drug testing in schools|conclusion|The future benefits should be taken into account too.
4546| Drug testing in schools|premise|Given that random tests have the deterrent effect, they prevent the development of serious addictions (such as when people move on from marijuana to heroine).
4547| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks allocate collective resources where it is needed most.
4547| Earmarks|premise|It is important that our collective resources be spend on specific needs.
4548| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks allow representatives to effectively apply local knowledge.
4548| Earmarks|premise|"""for the most part, the officials charged with dispensing stimulus dollars will do the best they can with what they have, because they are in fact closer to the people and will catch hell if they don’t do their jobs."
4549| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmark spending is more targeted and effective.
4549| Earmarks|premise|"""Competition for funding, combined with flexibility and local knowledge, makes earmarks 'often some of the best expenditures the federal government makes in a particular area,' Lilly says."
4550| Earmarks|conclusion|Legislators cannot fully examine all earmarks.
4550| Earmarks|premise|"Steve Ellis of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense - ""There's no way the Appropriations Committee is able to vet the thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars."
4551| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are often unrelated to legislation.
4551| Earmarks|premise|Sometimes a good piece of legislation that receives the support of a majority of congressman will be held up and voted down purely on the basis that it contains an egregious, unrelated earmark.
4552| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks can help the passage of important legislation.
4552| Earmarks|premise|Earmarks can be used to assuage the concerns of legislators over elements of legislation, allowing the legislation to pass.
4553| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are representatives' duty to constituents.
4553| Earmarks|premise|"""Some members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, eschew earmarks."
4554| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are part of federalism/power-sharing between nation/states.
4554| Earmarks|premise|"""for the most part, the officials charged with dispensing stimulus dollars will do the best they can with what they have, because they are in fact closer to the people and will catch hell if they don’t do their jobs."
4555| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks enable strong congressional check on executive spending.
4555| Earmarks|premise|"""So it’s bemusing to hear people now complain that the federal stimulus package has little congressional mandate as to how it will be spent."
4556| Earmarks|conclusion|Opponents of earmarks unjustifiably bash government.
4556| Earmarks|premise|"""The complaining about lack of congressional oversight in the stimulus package underscores the absurdity of the post-modern America polity: We brag about our freedom, democracy, and superior form of government, and yet relatively few Americans have any faith in it including earmarks or understand how it works."
4557| Earmarks|conclusion|Politicians bash earmarks to appear fiscally disciplined.
4557| Earmarks|premise|Bashing earmarks is part of a game played by politicians to appear to be fiscally disciplined and cutting-down on wasteful spending.
4558| Earmarks|conclusion|Opponents of earmarks hypocritically engage in practice.
4558| Earmarks|premise|"""One of the ironies in the anti-earmark position is that often its strongest advocates are among the first to demand funds for projects in their own Congressional districts."
4559| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks cannot be fully examined during short period of exposure.
4559| Earmarks|premise|"Steve Ellis of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense - ""There's no way the Appropriations Committee is able to vet the thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars."
4560| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are often unrelated to legislation.
4560| Earmarks|premise|Earmarks often have nothing to do with the actual substance of a piece of legislation, relating to something else entirely.
4561| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks award funding based on politics not on merit.
4561| Earmarks|premise|"""Within the academic community, the earmarking process could become corrosive."
4562| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are more transparent than other spending programs.
4562| Earmarks|premise|"""Reformers who want to ban earmarking might think again."
4563| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks lack transparency and competition.
4563| Earmarks|premise|"""Earmarks are bad because they are obscure and do not face competitive review—except in the backroom politics of the Appropriations, Transportation, or other committees that engage in the process."
4564| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are just a targeted form of federal spending.
4564| Earmarks|premise|"""earmarks are not necessarily evil."
4565| Earmarks|conclusion|"One person's ""pork spending"" is another's valuable project."
4565| Earmarks|premise|"""One person's earmark is another's vitally needed infrastructure project."
4566| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks often go toward important social works.
4566| Earmarks|premise|"Tony Pearsall, a former police captain and city councilman in Vallejo, Arizona, said, ""When you are dealing with kids, who are our future, how can you consider it pork or unreasonable spending?"" In general, many or even most earmarks go toward important social works, such as education, that cannot be considered ""wasteful""."
4567| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are a very small part of government spending.
4567| Earmarks|premise|"""As transparency has taken over, the case against earmarks has melted away."
4568| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmark spending is no worse than other forms of spending.
4568| Earmarks|premise|"""Some earmark spending is silly, but then so is some non-earmark spending, and there is a lot more of the latter."
4569| Earmarks|conclusion|Focus on earmarks distracts from bigger spending issues.
4569| Earmarks|premise|"""Obsessing about earmarks, indeed, has the perverse, if convenient, effect of distracting the country from its real spending problems, thus substituting indignation for discipline."
4570| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks foster a culture of spending excesses.
4570| Earmarks|premise|"""unfortunate is the symbolism of earmarking."
4571| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks fuel excessive defense spending.
4571| Earmarks|premise|"""Some stats: 'The number of earmarks in the annual defense spending bill increased from 587 worth $4."
4572| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks create unsustainable institutional dependencies.
4572| Earmarks|premise|"""if institutions rely on earmarking, they face the vagaries of the political process in a much more capricious way."
4573| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are not inherently bad.
4573| Earmarks|premise|"""Putting all earmarks in the same boat, as critics often do, distorts the debate and does a disservice to the public."
4574| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks should be reformed, but ban is unnecessary.
4574| Earmarks|premise|"""Democrats made earmark reform a campaign issue in 2006 — and a reality in 2007 — because earmarks were at the heart of corruption scandals in Washington."
4575| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks have already been significantly reformed.
4575| Earmarks|premise|"""we cut the amount of spending on earmarks in half."
4576| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are susceptible to bribery and corruption.
4576| Earmarks|premise|"""Earmarks are federal dollars that members of Congress dole out to favor seekers — often campaign donors."
4577| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks are used by politicians to effectively buy votes.
4577| Earmarks|premise|"""Earmarks aren’t just corruption bait, though."
4578| Earmarks|conclusion|"Earmarks foster a selfish ""bring-home-the-pork"" mentality."
4578| Earmarks|premise|"""The conventional view in the House is Americans really don't care about lobbying reform because they take corruption for granted, and it won't especially hurt Republicans (or benefit Democrats) this fall."
4579| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks benefit all equally in the long-run.
4579| Earmarks|premise|While it is true that some citizens will benefit from earmarks disproportionately from earmarks in any given year, that is OK.
4580| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks need not benefit all equally to be justified.
4580| Earmarks|premise|There is no reason why earmarks must benefit all citizens equally, even if they do roughly achieve this objective in the long-run.
4581| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks divide federal tax dollars unequally.
4581| Earmarks|premise|Earmarks are spending projects that take federal tax dollars, drawn from taxpayers across a nation, and spend them for isolated projects that benefit a very small and targeted group of people.
4582| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks benefit citizens with powerful legislators.
4582| Earmarks|premise|As certain senior members of the legislative branch achieve greater sway and power, they are able to control and direct disproportionate swaths of federal taxpayer dollars toward their home state.
4583| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks have existed since inception of US democracy.
4583| Earmarks|premise|"""Since the age of Jefferson, members of Congress have been earmarking money in spending bills for local projects that might not otherwise receive attention from federal agencies--and doing it to win votes back home."
4584| Earmarks|conclusion|Earmarks were not envisioned by Founding Fathers.
4584| Earmarks|premise|"""Despite all the evidence to the contrary and the vast opposition of the American people, here on FlashReport there continues to be Republicans arguing in favor of earmarks."
4597| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism's human impact on nature is part of the natural process.
4597| Ecotourism|premise|Humans are part of nature, and their impact on nature is part of the World's natural processes.
4598| Ecotourism|conclusion|Some negative externalities from eco-tourism are ok.
4598| Ecotourism|premise|There are certainly some negative impacts from eco-tourism.
4599| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism incentivizes environmental protection over exploitation.
4599| Ecotourism|premise|Landowners, in third world countries in particular, are often faced with the question of how to make their lands profitable.
4600| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism cultivates a conservation ethic.
4600| Ecotourism|premise|Environmental conservation is achieved through popular support and pressure.
4601| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism generates funds for conservation.
4601| Ecotourism|premise|The profits from many ecotourism businesses can be used to expand conservation efforts.
4602| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism encourages the tourism industry to be greener.
4602| Ecotourism|premise|Tourism is going to happen whether we like it or not.
4603| Ecotourism|conclusion|Human's should not tour natural areas because they will degrade them.
4603| Ecotourism|premise|No matter how careful humans are, if they descend on an area to tour it, they will degrade that ecosystem.
4604| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism can disturb wildlife.
4604| Ecotourism|premise|Wildlife is often disturbed by ecotourists.
4605| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism can damage habitats.
4605| Ecotourism|premise|Even ecotourists will inevitably deposit trash, trample on some plants, and even bring certain damaging microbes to a habitat that are capable of having devastating effects.
4606| Ecotourism|conclusion|"Ecotourism is just ""green-washing"" for profit."
4606| Ecotourism|premise|The tourism industry realizes that its consumers like to see that their tours are environmentally friendly, at least in name.
4607| Ecotourism|conclusion|The success of Ecotourism is bad for the environment.
4607| Ecotourism|premise|The ecotourism industry is growing incredibly quickly, with annual revenue growth in the double digits.
4608| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism builds cultural awareness and respect.
4608| Ecotourism|premise|A big part of Ecotourism's mission is to reveal cultures and build respect and understanding.
4609| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism does not preserve but damages local cultures.
4609| Ecotourism|premise|The commercialization of cultures through tourism does not preserve cultures.
4610| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism economically benefits local people.
4610| Ecotourism|premise|Ecotourism is an industry brought to local environments that supplies many various jobs in tours, lodging, restaurants, and in all other accompanying elements of the tourism industry.
4611| Ecotourism|conclusion|Local community benefits from ecotourism are minimal.
4611| Ecotourism|premise|"Foreign companies gain the most from ""ecotourism""."
4612| Ecotourism|conclusion|Third world governments often seize local control to expand ecotourism.
4612| Ecotourism|premise|Ecotourism can offer a substantial stream of revenue to poor countries and their governments.
4613| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism is good for the human soul and social health.
4613| Ecotourism|premise|While much emphasis in this debate is placed on the environmental pros and cons, it is important to consider the benefits to humans and society in general from these kinds of activities.
4614| Ecotourism|conclusion|Ecotourism raises awareness of host country socio-environmental politics.
4614| Ecotourism|premise|It is important that international awareness is raised not only about the need for conservation, but of the specific political issues surrounding conservation in a particular region or country.

4615| Ecotourism|premise|Ecotourism is a transnational corporate industry.
4616| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers honor right of parents/students to choose school.
4616| Education vouchers|premise|Parents and students have a right to choose what school they will attend.
4617| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers improve choice/access despite private school right to deny.
4617| Education vouchers|premise|It is true that private schools can deny students they believe to be unqualified.
4618| Education vouchers|conclusion|By giving parents a choice, vouchers engage parents more.
4618| Education vouchers|premise|Parents who have greater choice are more likely to be involved in their children's schooling.
4619| Education vouchers|conclusion|Students/parents with vouchers make better choices than bureaucrats.
4619| Education vouchers|premise|The voucher program in New Zealand benefited students in both the private and public schools by putting funding in the hands of students and parents instead of bureaucrats.
4620| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers lack choice as private schools can exclude students.
4620| Education vouchers|premise|Vouchers do not provide all public school students with a choice to attend private schools.
4621| Education vouchers|conclusion|Students choice of public schools can be improved without vouchers.
4621| Education vouchers|premise|The argument for vouchers relies on the premise that there is not enough choice in the public school system.
4622| Education vouchers|conclusion|Poor often can't afford private schools, even with vouchers.
4622| Education vouchers|premise|Given the limited budget for schools, a voucher system weakens public schools while at the same time not necessarily providing enough money for people to attend private schools.
4623| Education vouchers|conclusion|Competition via vouchers makes schools more efficient/effective.
4623| Education vouchers|premise|Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman argued for the modern concept of vouchers in the 1950s, stating that competition would improve schools and cost efficiency.
4624| Education vouchers|conclusion|Education vouchers force schools to hire competitive teachers.
4624| Education vouchers|premise|Schools that face choice-based incentives must increase the quality of the education they provide, which causes them to seek and keep better teachers and hold bad teachers to account.
4625| Education vouchers|conclusion|Cooperation, not competition, is best way to improve schools.
4625| Education vouchers|premise|Cooperation between schools, city and local officials, communities, and educational groups is the best way to improve schools.
4626| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers damage public schools that can't compete with private schools.
4626| Education vouchers|premise|Public schools are unlikely to be able to respond to increased competitive pressure generated by vouchers.
4627| Education vouchers|conclusion|Market-based education vouchers help supply demand.
4627| Education vouchers|premise|Under a student voucher system, where demand exists for education from the parents that would rather attend a different school, entrepreneurs are free to open and invest in new schools to accommodate demand.
4628| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers take advantage of more efficient private schools.
4628| Education vouchers|premise|State-run schools are more expensive per head than private equivalents.
4629| Education vouchers|conclusion|Public schools are a public good.
4629| Education vouchers|premise|Education does not fit well into a fungible supply/demand system.
4630| Education vouchers|conclusion|Profit motive of private schools is costly, undermining vouchers.
4630| Education vouchers|premise|Private sector schools require extra funds as the profit motive has to be met.
4631| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers give poor a choice of schools, lower inequality.
4631| Education vouchers|premise|School vouchers allow for greater economic diversity by offering lower income students opportunities to attend previously unaffordable private schools.
4632| Education vouchers|conclusion|Education vouchers improve minority academic achievement.
4632| Education vouchers|premise|There may be small achievement gains in mathematics for the African-American and Hispanic children who use vouchers.
4633| Education vouchers|conclusion|Voucher combat cultural genocide occurring in public schools.
4633| Education vouchers|premise|Some proponents of school vouchers, including the Sutherland Institute and many supporters of the Utah voucher effort, see it as a remedy for historic cultural genocide committed against demographic minorities by compulsory public schools.
4634| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers counter social division between public/private schools.
4634| Education vouchers|premise|The division between private and public schools is very prominent in society, based largely on the socio-economic ability of parents.
4635| Education vouchers|conclusion|Even with vouchers, private schools can still exclude certain groups.
4635| Education vouchers|premise|Because private schools can exclude students, even ones with vouchers, there is a tendency for them to exclude certain socio-economic, ethnic, or disabled groups.
4636| Education vouchers|conclusion|Education vouchers worsen economic and ethnic divisions.
4636| Education vouchers|premise|"""A pure voucher system would only encourage economic, racial, ethnic, and religious stratification in our society."
4637| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers worsen gap between private and public schools.
4637| Education vouchers|premise|"""Americans want consistent standards for students."
4638| Education vouchers|conclusion|School vouchers mostly benefit the affluent.
4638| Education vouchers|premise|A voucher system that offers choice to parents is used most by affluent parents that are already engaged in the education of their students and whom would prefer that their child leave a failing school.
4639| Education vouchers|conclusion|Voucher funding often goes to those that can afford private schools.
4639| Education vouchers|premise|Voucher are like a discount coupon for those who can already afford the full cost of a private school education.
4640| Education vouchers|conclusion|Voucher competition spurs schools to improve academic achievement.
4640| Education vouchers|premise|Voucher competition between public school districts spurs public schools to improve student outcomes.
4641| Education vouchers|conclusion|Competitive school voucher programs help increase graduation rates.
4641| Education vouchers|premise|Children that op-out of schools that are not serving them well are more likely to graduate than those who remain at schools that are failing them.
4642| Education vouchers|conclusion|Little evidence that vouchers improve academic achievement.
4642| Education vouchers|premise|In Chicago, there is little evidence that attending school choice programs provides any benefit on a wide variety of traditional academic measures, including standardized test scores, attendance rates, course-taking, and credit accumulation.
4643| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers foster competition that forces schools to improve themselves.
4643| Education vouchers|premise|Competition through free market capitalism would increase the quality of education for both private and public education sectors as it has for higher education with publicly funded state universities directly competing against private universities.
4644| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers allows for creative destruction of bad schools.
4644| Education vouchers|premise|Under a voucher system, successful schools would attract students, while bad schools would be forced to reform or close.
4645| Education vouchers|conclusion|Education vouchers allow students to leave failing schools.
4645| Education vouchers|premise|Many state schools are failing and a voucher system provides an escape valve for students that would otherwise be locked into unfortunate circumstances.
4646| Education vouchers|conclusion|Universities succeed because they are more like voucher system.
4646| Education vouchers|premise|The key difference between a k-12 and a University system is that the U.
4647| Education vouchers|conclusion|Student voucher programs help develop healthy school cultures.
4647| Education vouchers|premise|Vouchers allow individual school cultures to develop, enabling teachers to choose schools that promote teaching approaches that match their teaching styles, and enable students/parents to choose schools that match the students learning styles and abilities.
4648| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers promote innovation and specialisation.
4648| Education vouchers|premise|As schools work to attract particular kinds of pupils, variety and choice within the education system is increased.
4649| Education vouchers|conclusion|School vouchers leave worst schools and students behind.
4649| Education vouchers|premise|Some pupils will always end up stuck in dying, under-funded schools because over-subscribed schools cannot expand fast enough.
4650| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers drain talent from public schools, undermining competitiveness.
4650| Education vouchers|premise|"Some economist critics point to the problem of ""cream skimming,"" a variety of adverse selection in the educational market."
4651| Education vouchers|conclusion|School vouchers erode national educational standards.
4651| Education vouchers|premise|Education vouchers erode educational standards by allowing public funding to go to private programs that may not reflect strong national educational standards.
4652| Education vouchers|conclusion|Private education, with vouchers, is no better than public education.
4652| Education vouchers|premise|One reason given for being allowed to choose private schools is the belief that private schools offer better education – a belief disputed by the United States Department of Education in their 2006 study of the public education they oversee.
4653| Education vouchers|conclusion|Public schools are being improved without vouchers.
4653| Education vouchers|premise|"""NEA and its affiliates support direct efforts to improve public schools."
4654| Education vouchers|conclusion|Privatization of public schools through vouchers is a good thing.
4654| Education vouchers|premise|The Liberty and Democracy Party of Australia supports vouchers as a stepping-stone to abolishing public schools.
4655| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers forget that education is a public good, not a private good.
4655| Education vouchers|premise|The argument that education is a private good is based on the failure to differentiate education from public education.
4656| Education vouchers|conclusion|Market-based voucher system clashes with right to education.
4656| Education vouchers|premise|Under a 'market' system there is no guarantee that school places will be provided in isolated areas where there are not enough pupils to justify private investment or that schools will accept disabled pupils, whose education may require more funds than the voucher provides.
4657| Education vouchers|conclusion|Public school job loss from vouchers will be offset in private schools.
4657| Education vouchers|premise|Any loss of supply and demand for public institutions would be offset and equalized by the increased demand for private institutions.
4658| Education vouchers|conclusion|Student vouchers will cost many public school teachers their jobs.
4658| Education vouchers|premise|Student vouchers cost public teachers their jobs as students leave public schools for private schools with their vouchers.
4659| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers stop parents paying twice for public and private schools.
4659| Education vouchers|premise|Under non-voucher education systems, citizens that currently pay for private schooling are still charged taxes that are used to fund public schools.
4660| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers increase local accountability over central control.
4660| Education vouchers|premise|Education vouchers localize accountability as opposed to relying on central government standards.
4661| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers introduce competition without over-regulating public schools.
4661| Education vouchers|premise|Incentives to improve schools can be introduced without drammatically changing the whole system of publicly run education.
4662| Education vouchers|conclusion|Student vouchers reduce democratic accountability in education.
4662| Education vouchers|premise|Another argument against the implementation of a school voucher system is its lack of accountability to the taxpayer.
4664| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers comply with separation of church and state.
4664| Education vouchers|premise|The main argument here is that vouchers are only individual aid, giving individuals the choice to go to a religious school, but of course not mandating that they do so.
4665| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers for religious schools increase competition across system.
4665| Education vouchers|premise|The inclusion in 1998 of religious private schools in the Milwaukee voucher program led to more than a three-fold increase in the number of private schools and almost a four-fold increase in the number of choice students, and to a further improvement of the public schools.
4666| Education vouchers|conclusion|Vouchers for religious schools violates church/state separation.
4666| Education vouchers|premise|Education is used to inculcate values that the society believes in and to promote social and civic awareness.
4667| Election of judges|conclusion|Elections make judges more democratically accountable.
4667| Election of judges|premise|"""Judicial races are not just beauty contests."
4668| Election of judges|conclusion|Elected judges are more in tune with public opinion.
4668| Election of judges|premise|The system of training through law schools and vocational work is elitist and prolonged, and leaves judges’ opinions at risk of being, or appearing, out of date or out of touch.
4669| Election of judges|conclusion|Judicial elections are far more transparent than appointments.
4669| Election of judges|premise|This is true in many ways.
4670| Election of judges|conclusion|Elected judges wrongly interpret public opinion over the law.
4670| Election of judges|premise|Legal decisions require a strict interpretation of law.
4671| Election of judges|conclusion|Election of judges bows to tyranny of the majority.
4671| Election of judges|premise|Without elections, the judiciary is a branch of government that is isolated away from elections, and a check is placed on the potential for a tyranny of the majority, which can occur when a majority of the population retains dominance in elections.
4672| Election of judges|conclusion|Judges can be made accountable without elections.
4672| Election of judges|premise|Judges are held to account by their ability to publish dissents, and by those who have the time and special knowledge needed to assess their capability.
4674| Election of judges|conclusion|Judges are appointed/confirmed by elected officials, democratically.
4674| Election of judges|premise|Judges are appointed and confirmed by elected officials, which means that they are democratically appointed, albeit indirectly, via the people's elected represantives.
4675| Election of judges|conclusion|Voters will ensure elected judges uphold the rule of law.
4675| Election of judges|premise|Voters have at heart upholding the rule of law, particularly because they are interested in maintaining their individual rights.
4676| Election of judges|conclusion|Judicial elections elevate debate and awareness of judiciary.
4676| Election of judges|premise|"""we don’t mean judicial elections are “better” because of who prevailed-this newspaper supported Karmeier-- but rather because of how much was debated."
4677| Election of judges|conclusion|Voters don't have enough info to pick the best judges.
4677| Election of judges|premise|Voters are overwhelmed with so much information, and so many candidates, they usually know little to nothing about candidates for judges.
4679| Election of judges|conclusion|Election of judges delegitimizes their role.
4679| Election of judges|premise|"""Here’s what electing judges does."
4680| Election of judges|conclusion|Elected judge conflicts of interests can be sufficiently regulated.
4680| Election of judges|premise|The US Supreme Court ruled in a June 2009 West Virginia case that judges must recuse themselves from cases involving high-dollar donors who helped them win their seats.
4681| Election of judges|conclusion|Correlation between interests of donors and judges doesn't prove corruption.
4681| Election of judges|premise|Some have tried to demonstrate a correlation between the interests of donors to the election campaigns of judges and the ultimate decisions of those judges.
4682| Election of judges|conclusion|Appointment of judges is more prone to corruption than elections.
4682| Election of judges|premise|The appointment of judges can be done corruptly, in which a judge is appointed based solely on a close relationship, or because their is some promise of financial reward for making the appointment.
4683| Election of judges|conclusion|Elections damage trust in impartiality of judges.
4683| Election of judges|premise|"""Some years ago, I was told of a lawyer who was sitting with a client in court, waiting for a newly assigned judge to hear his case."
4684| Election of judges|conclusion|Elected justices are corruptly influenced by campaign funders.
4684| Election of judges|premise|"""a Tulane Law School professor has concluded after he and another scholar studied voting patterns on the state's high court over 14 years."
4685| Election of judges|conclusion|Donors influence judges' decisions.
4685| Election of judges|premise|Some argue that donors are simply giving money to judges of similar judicial philosophies.
4686| Election of judges|conclusion|Lawyers may fund judge campaigns to influence trials.
4686| Election of judges|premise|"""These statewide races are expensive -- they can cost millions."
4687| Election of judges|conclusion|Elected judges increase the influence of special interests.
4687| Election of judges|premise|"The election of judges opens the door to special interests supporting campaigns and subsequently ""buying"" influence over judges."
4688| Election of judges|conclusion|Elected judges bring hassle of regulating conflicts of interests.
4688| Election of judges|premise|"""The high court ruled in a West Virginia case that judges must recuse themselves from cases involving high-dollar donors who helped them win their seats."
4689| Election of judges|conclusion|Impossible to avoid big-money influence in judicial elections.
4689| Election of judges|premise|"""Although most statewide judicial candidates participate in a public campaign financing system, that’s not a safeguard against big-money influence."
4690| Election of judges|conclusion|Unelected judiciaries are prone to recklessly expanding their powers.
4690| Election of judges|premise|"Thomas Jefferson: ""the germ of dissolution of our federal government is in the Constitution of the federal judiciary; an irresponsible body (for impeachment is scarcely a scarecrow), working like gravity by night and by day, gaining a little today and a little tomorrow, and advancing its noiseless step like a thief over the field of jurisdiction, until all shall be usurped from the states, and the government of all be consolidated into one."
4691| Election of judges|conclusion|Appointed judiciaries are more independent to check other branches.
4691| Election of judges|premise|In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton argued for the independence of judges.
4692| Election of judges|conclusion|"It is up to the people to decide which judges ""merit"" election."
4692| Election of judges|premise|It is presumptuous to conclude that the electorate is ill-qualified to determine the qualifications and merit of prospective judges and make appropriate selections based on their collective judgement of merit.
4693| Election of judges|conclusion|Screening can help ensure judicial candidates have sufficient merit.
4693| Election of judges|premise|Some have proposed a kind of hybrid system in which judicial elections exist, but in which a pre-screening process ensures that all candidates appropriately qualified to become a judge.
4694| Election of judges|conclusion|Elections and campaigning distracts judges from responsibilities.
4694| Election of judges|premise|"""there's the issue that election campaigning isn't always the best use of a judge's time."
4695| Election of judges|conclusion|Political style will replace merit with election of judges.
4695| Election of judges|premise|In judicial elections, money, looks, celebrity, or unabashed populism will triumph over reasoned and balanced moderation.
4696| Election of judges|conclusion|Elections frequently unseat experienced, and seat inexperienced, judges.
4696| Election of judges|premise|In general, elections tend to create a higher rate of turnover in the judiciary.
4697| Election of judges|conclusion|Judicial elections are known to produce inferior judiciaries.
4697| Election of judges|premise|"""Federal judges, who of course are exclusively selected by appointment rather than election, are widely seen as upholding a general standard of quality well above that of their state brethren."
4698| Election of judges|conclusion|Judicial elections are more competitive, open, and fair.
4698| Election of judges|premise|"""2004’s state supreme court race was the most intense and competitive judicial election Southern Illinois has ever seen."
4699| Election of judges|conclusion|Legal hierarchy surrounding appointments is not a meritocracy.
4699| Election of judges|premise|The complex, lengthy, and costly process which constitutes current legal training does not make for a fully meritocratic system.
4700| Election of judges|conclusion|Merit, not money, should sway judicial elections.
4700| Election of judges|premise|"""Now that a judge can be more open about his or her beliefs, money is flowing into judicial campaigns as never before."
4702| Election of judges|conclusion|Lawyers are not free to campaign against judges.
4702| Election of judges|premise|"""Lawyers are reluctant to run against a sitting judge for obvious reasons, particularly if the would-be candidate is a courtroom attorney."
4703| Election of judges|conclusion|Democracies have no obligation to merit.
4703| Election of judges|premise|Democracies, even representative, have nothing to uphold other than letting the voters have a voice.
4704| Election of judges|conclusion|Election of judges does not inherently require partisanship.
4704| Election of judges|premise|The election of judges is not inherently related to any affiliation with political parties.
4705| Election of judges|conclusion|Appointed judges are identified with the party of the appointer.
4705| Election of judges|premise|While some complain elections would make the judiciary partisan in nature, this seems to forget that the appointment of judges is partisan with the appointee typically carrying the banner of the appointers party.
4706| Election of judges|conclusion|Judicial elections need not be designed as partisan.
4706| Election of judges|premise|It is not necessary to design judicial elections so that candidates must affiliate with political parties.
4707| Election of judges|conclusion|Elections pressure judges to craft positions to win votes.
4707| Election of judges|premise|"""The evils of asking impartial judges to beat the bushes for votes and contributions are so obvious and so (nearly) universally conceded that I won't dwell on them at any length here."
4708| Election of judges|conclusion|Elected judges are effectively forced to join political parties.
4708| Election of judges|premise|"""Electing judges puts enormous control into the hands of a few party leaders, who (by definition) are unmitigated whores."
4709| Election of judges|conclusion|Unelected judges lack authority need by co-equal branch of govt.
4709| Election of judges|premise|Elections offer a certain amount of legitimacy.
4710| Election of judges|conclusion|Judiciary is weaker.
4710| Election of judges|premise|"The judiciary is almost always considered an inherently weaker branch of government due to its inherent lack of ""force"" and ""will""."
4711| Election of judges|conclusion|Rulings of elected judges are weakened by concerns of bias.
4711| Election of judges|premise|"""I think judicial election also creates a new way to nullify a judge's decision; if a losing party to a case can show that a judge received a significant contribution from anyone even associated with the winning party the losing party can point to this decision to demand a new trial."
4712| Election of judges|conclusion|Electing judges has the appearance of public legitimacy.
4712| Election of judges|premise|While it may be true that elections can create the appearance of conflicts of interests and corruption, is it not also true that appointments can create the appearance of corruption between the appointer and appointee, and because appointed judges are less accountable and transparent to the electorate? Elections have the appearance of public approval and legitimacy through the process of the election and the accountability that follows.
4713| Election of judges|conclusion|Election of judges has appearance of judges selling influence.
4713| Election of judges|premise|Even if judges are not acting corruptly per se, the need to raise large sums of money for effective campaigns does create the impression that judges are selling their influence.
4714| Election of judges|conclusion|The public has less respect for politician judges.
4714| Election of judges|premise|"Roscoe Pound told the American Bar Association (ABA) in 1906 when he was a Nebraska law professor, ""Putting courts into politics and compelling judges to become politicians, in many jurisdictions has almost destroyed the traditional respect for the Bench."
4715| Election of judges|conclusion|Very few countries have judicial elections.
4715| Election of judges|premise|Japan, Switzerland, and the United States are the only countries that hold judicial elections.
4716| Elective cesarean section|conclusion|Modern life is unnatural.
4716| Elective cesarean section|premise|"The is much false moralizing revolving around c-sections, centering on the argument that because c-sections are ""unnatural"" that they are subsequently wrong."
4717| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars can slash greenhouse gas emissions.
4717| Electric vehicles|premise|A July 2007 study by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) concludes that, by 2050, broad acceptance of PHEVs could cut up to 6.
4718| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Even coal-powered electric cars pollute less than gasoline cars.
4718| Electric vehicles|premise|"""About half our electricity comes from coal, and that will change, at best, slowly as we move to renewables."
4719| Electric vehicles|conclusion|"""Clean coal"" can generate cleaner electricity for electric cars."
4719| Electric vehicles|premise|Because coal is the predominant electricity source, it is foreseeable that it will remain a supplier of electricity to electric cars for some time.
4720| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars will get cleaner with more renewable sources.
4720| Electric vehicles|premise|"""as our efforts to green the grid take effect, and that's happening already, plug-in cars yield even greater reductions in GHGs."
4721| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars can be combined with regenerative braking.
4721| Electric vehicles|premise|Regenerative braking systems generate and store electricity from the action of braking a car.
4722| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars will have a negligible impact on emissions.
4722| Electric vehicles|premise|"""The electric car is no solution to smog in California's cities, according to a new report published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology."
4723| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars use coal-electricity and add to global warming.
4723| Electric vehicles|premise|Coal is the primary source of electricity globally.
4724| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars increase local coal emissions.
4724| Electric vehicles|premise|"As a result of using using electric cars powered by coal-electricity, ""in regions with heavy vehicle use, ozone levels and particulate matter could actually increase in areas near power plants."
4725| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars are uneconomical.
4725| Electric vehicles|premise|"Vinod Khosla, a well-known venture capitalist and one of the most prolific investors in green technologies, said in 2007, ""Are electric cars going to make a difference any time soon? No."
4726| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Public transportation is a better idea than electric cars.
4726| Electric vehicles|premise|Public transportation helps reduce energy consumption in general.
4727| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles are more resilient to price pressures.
4727| Electric vehicles|premise|Electricity is a form of energy that remains within the continent in which it is produced.
4728| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars often achieve 90% energy conversion efficiency.
4728| Electric vehicles|premise|This level of efficiency can be achieved over the full range of speeds and power outputs.
4729| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles are lighter so require less energy.
4729| Electric vehicles|premise|Because electric vehicles are lighter, they require less energy to travel the same distance, which means they save energy and money.
4730| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric car maintenance costs have fallen.
4730| Electric vehicles|premise|"""the good news is that over the years the repair costs have significantly come down due to manufacturers better understanding the technology, and have become much more adept to building reliable parts."
4731| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars are too expensive to be viable.
4731| Electric vehicles|premise|"Vinod Khosla, a well-known venture capitalist and one of the most prolific investors in green technologies, said in 2007, ""Are electric cars going to make a difference any time soon? No."
4732| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric car batteries are usually very expensive.
4732| Electric vehicles|premise|Electric car batteries are usually the most expensive component.
4733| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric car battery technology and costs are improving rapidly.
4733| Electric vehicles|premise|"""Among the most promising electric car batteries are new-generation lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries that could offer vehicle ranges of 300 miles or more."
4734| Electric vehicles|conclusion|New electric car batteries allow for charging in minutes.
4734| Electric vehicles|premise|In 2007, Altairnano's NanoSafe batteries are rechargeable in several minutes.
4735| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles need not be able to quickly recharge.
4735| Electric vehicles|premise|Most people do not usually require fast-recharging because they have enough time at night to plug their car in and re-charge.
4736| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles can recharge everywhere the electric grid exists.
4736| Electric vehicles|premise|Electric vehicles can be plugged in at home, in parking garages, at power stations, and essentially anywhere else the power-grid exists.
4737| Electric vehicles|conclusion|It takes too long to recharge electric vehicles.
4737| Electric vehicles|premise|It can take many hours to recharge an electric vehicle.
4738| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Few utilities can support widespread quick-charging.
4738| Electric vehicles|premise|"""Few utilities can support widespread quick-charging on top of other power requirements during peak demand."
4739| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Not safe to let citizens do electric car quick-charging.
4739| Electric vehicles|premise|"""Quick-charging of electric vehicles also requires current and voltage levels far beyond what the motoring public can safely handle."
4740| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars can utilize existing grid.
4740| Electric vehicles|premise|"""Electric cars can utilize the existing electric grid rather than require the development of a new, expensive energy infrastructure (as would be the case with hydrogen)."
4741| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars charge at night when electricity demand is low.
4741| Electric vehicles|premise|Electricity demand is lowest at night time.
4742| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles would place great strain on electric grids.
4742| Electric vehicles|premise|Electric cars consume a significant amount of electricity.
4743| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electricity shortages in some regions make electric cars inadvisable.
4743| Electric vehicles|premise|There have been electricity shortages in many regions of the world, including the United States.
4744| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars require less maintenance than gasoline vehicles.
4744| Electric vehicles|premise|This is partly due to the fact that electric motors are simpler than gasoline engines.
4745| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Regenerative braking systems reduce break-pedal wear and tear.
4745| Electric vehicles|premise|Instead of braking, it is possible, in electric cars, to engage a generator to slow a car.
4746| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric car batteries all must be replaced eventually.
4746| Electric vehicles|premise|All batteries die at some point and must be replaced.
4747| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars can accelerate faster than gasoline cars.
4747| Electric vehicles|premise|Electric cars actually have a much higher acceleration-rate than gasoline cars.
4748| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric car power and speed can be precisely controlled.
4748| Electric vehicles|premise|Electric cars have a very precise energy output controlled by the driver.
4749| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles vibrate less for a smoother ride.
4749| Electric vehicles|premise|Because electric cars do not have combustion engines, they have less vibration in the cabin.
4750| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles have a limited range.
4750| Electric vehicles|premise|This is due to the low energy density of batteries, compared to the fuel of internal combustion engined vehicles.
4751| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles take a long time to recharge.
4751| Electric vehicles|premise|It takes many hours to fully charge an electric vehicle battery.
4752| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Regenerative braking systems reduce braking dusts.
4752| Electric vehicles|premise|Braking dust is a problem in cities, because it has a foul smell, settles on the streets and other objects, and even makes it more difficult to breath.
4753| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric vehicles produce less noise than internal combustion engines.
4753| Electric vehicles|premise|This is due to the fact that electric motors do not involve combustion.
4754| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Silent electric cars can be a safety hazard.
4754| Electric vehicles|premise|Pedestrians benefit from the noise created by combustion engines, which provides greater warning of oncoming vehicles.
4755| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Lighter electric cars can be more vulnerable in collisions.
4755| Electric vehicles|premise|The key to attaining acceptable range with an electric car is to reduce the power required to drive the car, so far as is practical.
4756| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars fight global warming better than hybrids.
4756| Electric vehicles|premise|"Dan Lashof, science director of the Climate Center for NRDC, said in 2007, ""Next-generation PHEVs can reduce global warming and air pollution much more than regular hybrids—if we’re taking simultaneous action to clean the electric grid."
4757| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Hybrid vehicles do not overburden the electric grid.
4757| Electric vehicles|premise|A major complaint regarding electric cars is that, if they were deployed on a large scale, they would substantially increase the demand for electricity and place a major strain on electricity grids.
4758| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Electric cars reduce dependencies on foreign oil.
4758| Electric vehicles|premise|"""By using domestically-generated electricity rather than relying on foreign oil, we can achieve energy independence and will no longer need to engage in costly wars in the Middle East to secure an energy supply."
4759| Electric vehicles|conclusion|Domestic electricity is required for electric cars to replace gasoline.
4759| Electric vehicles|premise|The only way to relieve foreign oil dependencies is if a domestic supply of electricity exists.
4764| Emergency contraception|conclusion|Emergency contraception may be seen by some as an alternative to safer forms of contraception.
4764| Emergency contraception|premise|Its widespread easy availability would encourage women to have unprotected sex.
4765| Emergency contraception|conclusion|Only completely mis-informed individuals would rely solely on morning after pill for protection against pregnancy and STDs.
4765| Emergency contraception|premise|Given the existence of the various unpleasant side-effects discussed, nobody would sensibly choose the morning-after pill over other forms of contraception, or risk unprotected sex on the grounds that they can take a morning-after pill afterwards.
4766| Emergency contraception|conclusion|Emergency contraception encourages irresponsible sexual behavior.
4766| Emergency contraception|premise|If you have unprotected sex, you should accept the chance that, if you are a woman, you may get pregnant as a result.
4767| Emergency contraception|conclusion|Whether intentionally or otherwise, people do sometimes have unprotected sex without wanting to get pregnant.
4767| Emergency contraception|premise|When this happens, emergency contraception enables women to ensure that they are not pregnant, without the stress, uncertainty and increased health risk caused by waiting until a pregnancy can be confirmed and then, if desired, having an abortion.
4772| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA strengthens workers' ability and right to unionize.
4772| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""The Employee Free Choice Act would allow workers to form a union through “majority sign-up."
4773| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA preserves employee choice with majority sign-up voting.
4773| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|Opponents of the Employee Choice Act argue that somehow the Employee Free Choice Act eliminates employee rights to free choice through secret ballots.
4774| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Employee Free Choice Act eliminates workers' right to secret ballots.
4774| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|Rep.
4775| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA card checking campaigns can be unreliable and illegitimate.
4775| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""Organizing Without Majority Support."
4776| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA would foster the creation of unions workers may not want.
4776| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""In a nutshell, the E."
4777| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Too many workers want to unionize but can't currently.
4777| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""More than half of all U."
4778| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Employee Free Choice Act responds to worsening conditions for workers.
4778| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""It’s Time to Restore Workers’ Freedom to Form Unions."
4779| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA reforms a broken, undemocratic, and unfair US union system.
4779| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""the current system for forming unions and bargaining is broken."
4780| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA is biased toward increasing unions and their power.
4780| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""While the AFL-CIO and other unions support Kennedy's proposal to do away with secret ballot elections, they do favor secret ballot elections when it comes to decertifying a union, which is a procedure that permits workers to decide if they want to continue being represented by a union."
4781| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Unions are dwindling because few workers care to join.
4781| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""Few Workers Want to Organize."
4782| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Employee Free Choice Act protects unionizing workers from intimidation.
4782| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|Supporters of the Employee Free Choice Act argued that during the weeks (or months) it took to set up the election, management often conducted efforts to dissuade workers from organizing.
4783| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Secret voting systems allow for employer abuses.
4783| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"In the words of one labor activist, government-supervised secret-ballot orga­nizing elections ""look more like the discredited practices of rogue regimes abroad than like any­thing we would call American."
4784| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA gives employees equal access to injunctive relief.
4784| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""The Employee Free Choice Act gives employees equal access to injunctive relief."
4785| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Employee Free Choice Act favors one-sided union pitches.
4785| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""Even when union organizers do not threaten workers, card checks often do not reveal workers' free and considered choice about joining a union because workers do not hear both sides' pitches and lack time for reflection."
4786| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA opens door to intimidation of union holdouts.
4786| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""Harassing Holdouts."
4787| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|Employee Free Choice Act would not solve alleged employer abuses.

4789| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""The opposition to this legislation comes from the usual suspects and is thoroughly predictable."

4792| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""Employers Must Consider Year-Round Campaign."
4793| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA raises penalties on employers violating unionization laws.
4793| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""The Employee Free Choice Act would strengthen the penalties for anti-union discrimination committed during an organizing drive or first-contract negotiation by increasing the amount due victimized workers; providing for civil fines of up to $20,000 per violation for willful or repeated illegal acts; and requiring the NLRB to seek injunctive relief if it reasonably believes that an employer “significantly interferes with, restrains, or coerces employees” in the exercise of their rights, as is already required in similar cases against unions."
4794| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA is biased toward punishing employers and not unions.
4794| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"According to the Heritage Foundation, the EFCA wrongly ""increases penalties for unfair labor practices committed by employers but not by unions."
4795| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA allows employers or employees to seek negotiation mediation.
4795| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|"""Allow employers or employees to request mediation if they’re unable to negotiate a first contract."
4796| Employee Free Choice Act|conclusion|EFCA wrongly imposes binding arbitration on companies.
4796| Employee Free Choice Act|premise|Force flawed binding arbitration: The EFCA would require that a binding arbitration be required in the event that union and employer negotiations reached an impasse.

4802| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Ending sanctions will allow US to expand influence in Cuba.
4802| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|International influence can be characterized, in large part, by the various influences and connections a country holds in another country.
4803| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|US sanctions against Cuba cannot work unilaterally.
4803| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Sanctions are not very effective when implemented by only one country, as other countries may trade heavily with the sanctioned country, thus minimizing the economic harm from unilateral sanctions.

4809| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Sanctions are a good lever to influence Cuban political leaders toward liberalization.
4810| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Cubans aren't fooled by their regime's attempts to blame sanctions for failures.
4810| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Blaming America for all economic woes didn’t trick ordinary Russians and it won’t trick the Cubans.
4811| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Cuba sanctions lost national security rationale after 1991.

4812| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Cuba has cooperated with the United States on security matters.
4812| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Following September 11th, for example, Cuba offered to share information with the United States that would help in its subsequent War on Terror.

4817| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|In the 1990’s Cuba lost $70 Bn in trade and $1.
4818| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Sanctions violate the principle of just war.
4818| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Just war typically follows the logic that measures taken in war should not target or have substantially negative impacts on civilians of other countries.
4819| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Sanctions hurt Cuban-Americans with relatives in Cuba.
4819| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Sanctions make it too difficult for Cubans in America to travel to see or to financially support relatives in Cuba.

4820| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|The embargo on travel to Cuba from the United States damages Cuba's tourism industry.

4824| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Cuba's human rights violations are not merely a factor of capricious actions being taken by the Cuban regime.
4825| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Using sanctions to attempt regime change is illegal.
4825| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|To maintain sanctions in order to change the form of government, as the United States claims it does, is totally illegitimate under International Law.
4826| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Sanctions against Cuba violate United Nations resolutions since 1992.
4826| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|These resolutions were passed with only the US and Israel in opposition.
4827| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Sanctioning Cuba is appropriate punishment for its flouting the UN.

4831| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|The total Cuban GDP is a small drop in the ocean of the US economy.
4832| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Economic considerations should not be taken over principles supporting sanctions.
4832| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Even if Cuba was a vital market for American goods it would be worth giving up some economic growth in order to maintain a commitment to the freedom of the Cuban people.
4833| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Enforcing US-Cuba sanctions entails punishing businesses and allies.
4833| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Because the embargo makes it illegal for many US-related businesses to trade with Cuba, it becomes necessary for the United States to enforce these laws.
4834| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|Travel ban to Cuba perversely punishes innocent travelers.
4834| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|Travelers are not acting nefariously by traveling to Cuba.

4838| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|The Helms-Burton Act harms international businessmen, causing significant protest around the world.
4838| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|premise|This makes a mockery of the US claim to be a guardian of International Law, not only in its dealings with Cuba but also in the negotiations over the future of Iraq.
4839| Ending US sanctions on Cuba|conclusion|US-Cuba sanctions exist only to appease Republicans in Florida.

4860| English as US official language|premise|"""Learning to speak English empowers immigrants."
4861| English as US official language|conclusion|15m Americans don't speak English.

4902| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Islamic terrorists can release info after reaching pain threshold.
4902| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"A Justice Department memo on May 30, 2005 reads: ""as Abu Zubaydah himself explained with respect to enhanced techniques, 'brothers who are captured and interrogated are permitted by Allah to provide information when they believe they have reached the limit of their ability to withhold it in the face of psychological and physical hardship."

4912| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|Mr.
4913| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations don't inflict severe pain/suffering .
4913| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate US prohibitions against torture if their methods avoided inflicting ""severe pain and suffering""."
4914| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Interrogations are not torture when no intent to torture.
4914| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate US prohibitions against torture unless they ""have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering"", according to a previously secret US Justice Department memo released on 24 July 2008."
4915| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Aggressive enhanced interrogation techniques were rarely used.
4915| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"George Tenet wrote in his 2007 book, ""At the Center of the Storm"" (pp 241-42): ""The most aggressive interrogation techniques conducted by CIA personnel were applied to only a handful of the worst terrorists on the planet, including people who had planned the 9/11 attacks and who, among other things, were responsible for journalist Daniel Pearl’s death."
4916| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogation techniques amount to torture.
4916| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|On May 19 2006, the UN Committee against Torture issued a report stating the U.
4917| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|"Enhanced interrogations inflict ""severe pain/suffering"" ."
4917| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|Enhanced interrogations inflict sever pain and suffering, both physically and psychologically, and thus amount to torture under international law, as defined by the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
4918| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations commonly caused permanent damage.
4918| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|The Washington Post reported in January 2009 that Susan J.
4919| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Bush wrongly created own definition of torture.
4919| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"Asked about President George Bush's comments in October 10, 2007 that ""This government does not torture people"", former President Jimmy Carter said, ""That's not an accurate statement if you use the international norms of torture as has always been honored -- certainly in the last 60 years since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was promulgated."
4920| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|President has sole discretion to interpret i-law during war.
4920| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"At the heart of policies in the ""War on Terror"" is the notion that during a time of war the President, in his duty as Commander-in-Chief, cannot be bound by law, i."
4921| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Non-state terrorists are not protected under international law.
4921| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|John Yoo's analysis that the US President was not bound by the Geneva Conventions, and was free to implement enhanced interrogations even if they flaunted these conventions, was based upon work about World War II by Carl Schmitt.
4922| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations are cruel/immoral, even if not torture.
4922| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"In November 2006, former US army Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain's El Pais newspaper said of Bush Administration interrogation tactics: ""The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ."
4923| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Coercive interrogation techniques are generally abhorrent.
4923| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|Any interrogation technique that attempts to coerce individuals into providing information or confessions against their will is inherently degrading and morally abhorrent.
4924| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Geneva Conventions apply to all prisoners, including terrorists.
4924| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|The US Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v.
4925| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Terrorists' methods do not justify enhanced interrogations.

4926| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|US President has sole discretion on enhanced interrogations.
4926| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"""In wartime, it is for the President alone to decide what methods to use to best prevail against the enemy."
4927| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|US Constitution does not apply to enemy combatants.
4927| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"A US Department of Justice Memo written on March 14, 2003 read: ""we conclude that the Fifth and Eighth Amendments, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, do not extend to· alien enemy combatants held abroad."
4928| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations constitutional because they are not punishment.
4928| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said on BBC Radio 4 that since these methods are not intended to punish they do not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, barring ""cruel and unusual punishment"", and as such may not be unconstitutional."

4929| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"""We conclude below that the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause is inapplicable to the conduct of interrogations of alien enemy combatants held outside the United States for two independem reasons."
4930| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogation techniques are unconstitutional.
4930| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"Philip Zelikow, a former State Department lawyer and adviser to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, stated that he had argued it was unlikely that ""any federal court would agree (that the approval of harsh interrogation techniques) ."
4931| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations violet cruel and unusual punishment laws.
4931| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|Cruel and unusual punishment is a statement implying that governments shall not inflict such treatment for crimes, regardless of their degree of severity.
4932| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations violate due process laws.
4932| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|The presumption in the case of interrogations is that a suspected terrorist is guilty of committing terrorism.
4933| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|US maintained values/laws amidst worse enemies than terrorists.

4934| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogation should not be condemned because of bad apples.
4934| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"There are certainly cases of abuses that have occurred, in which interrogators have gone beyond the limits of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and engaged in what could be called torture, inflicting severe pain and suffering and even permanent physical and mental damage."
4935| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations are often too aggressive, amounting to torture.
4935| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|The Washington Post reported in January 2009 that Susan J.
4936| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations are torture.
4936| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"Even without any bad apples, and with interrogators following the script on ""enhanced interrogations"", the techniques still amount to torture."
4937| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Secret prisons protect methods in a time of war.
4937| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|It is critical in a time of war that one's enemy not know the interrogations methods that might be employed against their men.
4938| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Secret prisons with enhanced interrogations are immoral/illegal.
4938| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|On May 19 2006, the UN Committee against Torture issued a report that admonishes secret prisons, the use of which, is considered to amount to torture as well and should be discontinued.
4939| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|"Many countries perform ""enhanced interrogations""."
4939| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|These include, forced standing, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold, waterboarding.
4940| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|US has condemned harsh interrogations abroad.
4940| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"Human Rights Watch (HRW) observed that numerous countries engage in activities that are similar to the ones allegedly used by the CIA: ""The U."
4941| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Enhanced interrogations are similar to Nazi methods.
4941| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"Andrew Sullivan, a conservative blogger for The Atlantic, wrote on May 29, 2007 that many of the interrogative techniques condoned by the Bush administration were used by the Nazis in the 1930s and 40s: ""The very phrase used by the president to describe torture-that-isn't-somehow-torture - ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" - is a term originally coined by the Nazis."
4942| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|"""Enhanced interrogations"" were adapted from abusive foreign tactics."
4942| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"A bipartisan report in December 2008 established that, ""harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA and the U."
4943| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Waterboarding leaves no lasting scars and so is not torture.
4943| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|Torture is defined by many groups as a only techniques that leaves lasting physical damage and scars on the person being tortured.
4944| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|US halted waterboarding early in the Bush Administration.
4944| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"ABC News' Luis Martinez reported in a January 15, 2009 article: ""Former CIA director Michael Hayden said the legality of waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques is an 'uninteresting question to the CIA' right now because the agency has not engaged in the practices since March 2003."
4945| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Waterboarding inflicts severe pain and suffering .
4945| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"The consensus definition of torture in such conventions as the UN Convention against torture, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Courts is that it inflicts ""severe pain and suffering"" for the purpose of extracting information or a confession."
4946| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|US prosecuted foreign governments for waterboarding.
4946| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"""Even George J."
4947| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Prolonged isolation does not cause severe pain and suffering.
4947| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|Prolonged isolation might be uncomfortable and upsetting for and individual, but it does not go so far as to cause severe pain and suffering.
4948| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Isolation disturbs individuals and impairs their recall of info.

4949| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Sleep deprivation is wholly up to the subject.
4949| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|At any point during the interrogation the subject can disclose the information and subsequently be allowed to sleep.
4950| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|Sleep deprivation is a form of torture.
4950| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|Under one interrogation technique, a subject might be kept awake for several days and when finally allowed to fall asleep, suddenly awakened and questioned.
4951| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|If not torture, sleep deprivation is cruel and inhumane.
4951| Enhanced interrogation techniques|premise|"Nicole Bieske, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International Australia, has stated, ""At the very least, sleep deprivation is cruel, inhumane and degrading."
4952| Enhanced interrogation techniques|conclusion|"Torture ""to save lives"" has a substantial body of support among publics."

4954| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|It is outrageous that in the modern world women can be paid less than men for doing the same job.
4954| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|Sport or not, the widely accepted principle of equal pay in the workplace ought to be applied – after all, these are professionals with jobs that should be treated like any other.
4955| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|Men's higher inherent ability to perform in sports has a higher market value.
4955| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|Of course women should be paid equal pay – for equal work.
4956| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|Male athletes have received unrepresentative support from male sport administrators and media executives.
4956| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|How can this fairly be decided, when men’s sports dominate media coverage so thoroughly? The market has been conditioned historically by the preferences of biased male sports administrators and media executives.
4957| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|Women’s sports are played at a lower level precisely because there is less money in them.
4957| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|This cycle has to be broken at some point.
4958| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|The market decides the ratio of reward – and there isn’t a fairer method of deciding than that.
4958| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|The male game is more popular.
4959| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|One quick fix could be to equalize pay first in tournaments with joint men’s and women’s events.
4959| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|It also makes sense symbolically to begin with something like Wimbledon, where both men’s and women’s games are played at a very high level and both are very popular.
4960| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|Equal-pay campaigns are selectively discriminatory and risk causing a backlash against joint tournaments that will harm female pay.
4960| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|It is not really fair that tournaments in which both sexes (separately) compete, such as Wimbledon, are singled out for campaigns for equality, as different levels of popularity and physical ability has resulted in this differentiation across all major sports – such as soccer, rugby, cricket, basketball, baseball.
4961| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|Wimbledon stands out as discriminatory given that two other ‘Grand Slam’ tournaments  pay equal prize money.
4961| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|The Wimbledon tournament trades party upon a sense of history and tradition, but upholding discrimination makes it look outdated.
4962| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|Equal prize money in tournaments is the exception rather than the norm.
4962| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|Wimbledon and the French Open both have larger men’s prizes.
4963| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|Wimbledon is losing face by maintaining that women should not receive equal pay.
4963| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|It is not in the tournament’s interests to do this: it makes Wimbledon and similar events look bad, and over time it will only become more of an issue.
4964| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|conclusion|On the contrary, this is an accepted principle in world sports and anyone trying to blackmail a tournament would lose public sympathy themselves.
4964| Equal prize money for male and female athletes|premise|They also wouldn’t change anything except denying themselves the chance to compete, as winning is so prestigious that plenty of other women will still enter and protestors will just get forgotten as the tournament progresses.

4976| Estate tax in the United States|conclusion|Repealing estate tax would cost govt significant revenues.
4976| Estate tax in the United States|premise|"""Making the repeal of the estate tax permanent after 2010 would reduce revenues by $290 billion through 2015, including $72 billion in 2015 alone."
4977| Estate tax in the United States|conclusion|Repealing estate tax would negatively affect social programs.
4977| Estate tax in the United States|premise|"""The Thomas estate-tax bill and the Gregg budget-enforcement bill would result in multi-million dollar tax cuts for the estates of the wealthiest Americans who die, with these lavish tax cuts being financed by large reductions in health care, retirement, and other benefits on which millions of ordinary Americans rely."

5021| European Defence Force|premise|With its origins in the Cold War, and its preponderance of American influence, NATO carries a great deal of historical and geopolitical baggage.

5046| European missile defense|premise|"""The debate should not be, in my view, about issues of 20 years ago and issues of a so-called arms race, and in this context I was struck that today, today in Berlin as a matter of fact, the Americans and Russians are sitting down to discuss post-START issues and transparency issues for the post-START regime after the START Treaty expires."
5047| European missile defense|conclusion|European missile defense reawakens Cold War tensions and conflict.
5047| European missile defense|premise|"""When the Soviet Union first built a limited missile defense system in the late 1960s, the United States responded by building up a nuclear strike strategy to overwhelm the new technology."
5048| European missile defense|conclusion|Radar in Brdy is vital to Czech Republic's security.
5048| European missile defense|premise|Radar (or any other component of the missile defence system) is of great importance to the security of the Czech Republic (as well as Europe).
5049| European missile defense|conclusion|Public opinion is immaterial.
5049| European missile defense|premise|Public opinion should not be taken into consideration when national defence is at stake, mostly because the main problem is NIMBY: People might want missile defence - but not right in their backyard.
5050| European missile defense|conclusion|Missile defense in the Czech Republic makes the country a target.
5050| European missile defense|premise|Josef Skuhra, 57, a Czech village maintenance worker.
5051| European missile defense|conclusion|Missile bases are illegitimate without popular approval.
5051| European missile defense|premise|The current attempt to place a base here, this time from the other direction, would serve to reawaken the Cold War in Europe and could reignite a new arms race.
5052| European missile defense|conclusion|The majority of poles oppose missile defense on their territory.
5052| European missile defense|premise|According to polls conducted by survey center Pentor, more than half (53%) of Poles are against deployment of American missile defense elements on the country's territory, while 34% support it.
5053| European missile defense|conclusion|Missile defenses in Europe will advance US interests over host country.
5053| European missile defense|premise|"""If our country plays host to this extraordinarily powerful and technically advanced U."
5054| European missile defense|conclusion|Missile defense bases breach sovereignty of European hosts.
5054| European missile defense|premise|"""Just as in the case of a missile base, the Czech Republic would have no say in what happens at a U."
5055| European missile defense|conclusion|European missile defense will improve transatlantic security.
5055| European missile defense|premise|"""There are other advantages to fielding a missile defense system in Europe for the United States, too."
5056| European missile defense|conclusion|European missile defense is bitterly dividing EU.
5056| European missile defense|premise|"""The unilateral U."
5057| European missile defense|conclusion|European missile defense gives EU veto in US security.
5057| European missile defense|premise|"""such weapons will give our allies a veto over whether or not an ICBM aimed at a US city will or will not hit its target."
5058| European missile defense|conclusion|European missile defense is a necessary part of a layered defense.
5058| European missile defense|premise|"""Myth #5: Other missile defense systems such as THAAD and Aegis would be more valuable than the proposed third site installations."
5059| European missile defense|conclusion|Space-based defenses more effective than EU missile defense.
5059| European missile defense|premise|"""If America were to channel some of the funds it now spends in Europe into a new space-based military force, future Presidents will have undreamed of military alternatives."
5060| European missile defense|conclusion|Space-based missile defense not subject to EU politics.
5060| European missile defense|premise|"""A new version of Brilliant Pebbles or an orbital battlestation would be far more effective and would not be subject to the vagaries of European politics."
5061| European missile defense|conclusion|Missile defense would increase arms spending and harm the poor.
5061| European missile defense|premise|The construction of more bases threatens to spark new cycles of armament around the world.
5062| European missile defense|conclusion|US missile defense spending is out of proportion to relative benefits.
5062| European missile defense|premise|"""Rep."
5063| European missile defense|conclusion|NATO members support a European missile defense system.
5063| European missile defense|premise|"""Myth #2: NATO is opposed to a U."
5064| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|European Monetary Fund creates global AND regional system.
5064| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""The EMF would represent a major reshaping of global financial architecture  The main point is that it makes sense to have a two tier system – at the regional level (or for countries grouped in some other way, like “emerging markets”) and at the global level, meaning the IMF."
5065| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|European Monetary Fund avoids 'foreign' IMF intervention.
5065| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""The leading economies among the 16 countries forming the eurozone, with Germany to the fore, do not want the Washington-based International Monetary Fund poking its nose into their affairs."
5066| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|IMF bailout would humiliate EU, undermine its legitimacy.
5066| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""An EMF would address a sticky situation within the European fold—the IMF is typically the source of emergency funding for countries looking to avoid debt crises, but IMF involvement in Europe would seriously undermine the image of the euro zone as a functioning entity."
5067| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|EU needs European Monetary Fund with equal power as IMF.
5067| European Monetary Fund|premise|"German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said at the weekend that ""for the internal stability of the eurozone, we need an institution that has the experience and power of the IMF."
5068| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|The EMF was specially designed for the Euro Bloc.
5068| European Monetary Fund|premise|The European Monetary Fund is slightly different from the IMF.
5069| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|The IMF was not designed for developed Euro countries.
5069| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""This was the standard case for Third World countries and the solution was provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF,) which intervened and straightened up the big spender with a strong diet that, however, was never applied to a “First” World countries such as Greece, Spain or Italy."
5070| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|European Monetary Fund is repetitive of IMF functions.
5070| European Monetary Fund|premise|"Desmond Lachman wrote in an Economist magazine EMF roundtable: ""What is even less clear is why Gros and Mayer would want to reinvent the wheel by creating a European Monetary Fund, when one has the International Monetary Fund that already has the expertise to impose the appropriate conditionality on lending to wayward countries like Greece."
5071| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|EMF would not be big enough to save entire EU countries.
5071| European Monetary Fund|premise|"Roberto Perotti argued in the Economist magazine roundtable on this topic: ""(B)y the authors’ calculations this facility would today give Greece access to something like ."
5072| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|The IMF has neutral bargaining power.
5072| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""The IMF usually has maximal bargaining power at a country’s moment of crisis – it typically cares far less about whether the country makes it through than the country itself does, and hence can extract harsh conditions in return for aid."
5073| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|If EMF is more strict, countries will go to the IMF.
5073| European Monetary Fund|premise|"Edwin Truman said in the Economist magazine roundtable on the European Monetary Fund: ""if the EMF were tougher than the IMF is on average in terms of its economic and financial conditions, then Euro area countries would prefer to go to the IMF for assistance."
5074| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|Calling IMF is not humiliating, but sensible during crisis.
5074| European Monetary Fund|premise|"Despite the fact that the IMF is (in the EU) seen as ""Washington"", the truth is that the IMF is an international body ""crammed with clever economists and technocrats from around the world."
5075| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|EMF would improve EU fiscal federalism/coherence.
5075| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""The fact that individual countries within the euro area cannot use monetary policy to stabilise their economies means they must rely upon fiscal policy as their main stabilisation tool."
5076| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|EMF would allow orderly sovereign default.
5076| European Monetary Fund|premise|"Daniel Gros and Thomas Mayer's proposed a European Monetary Fund (EMF) in an Economist guest column, arguing that the status quo in the EU was ""a failure to allow for an orderly sovereign default."
5077| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|The EMF could impose tougher sanctions.
5077| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""Lack of sanctions allowed Greece to run up a budget deficit equivalent to 12."
5078| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|EMF is not a short-term solution to immediate crisis.
5078| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""'It does not appear to me to be the absolute priority in the short term,' Ms."
5079| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|EMF will not solve EU structural fiscal problems.
5079| European Monetary Fund|premise|"Tyler Cowen argued that the ""underlying problems of European multilateral governance"" are unlikely to ""be solved by creating an entirely new and different institution."
5080| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|The EMF siphons off capital, increases national borrowing costs.
5080| European Monetary Fund|premise|"The ""EMF borrowing on financial markets would immediately siphon off investible capital and increase interest rates."
5081| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|Strictly enforcing budgets is better than creating EMF.
5081| European Monetary Fund|premise|"Germany's Jürgen Stark, a member of the European Central Bank's executive committee, said in March of 2010: ""Instead of a European monetary fund, budget rules must be strengthened and strictly enforced through a stringent surveillance mechanism."
5082| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|The EMF could be financed effectively.
5082| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""Countries could, for instance, be charged an annual contribution of 1% of their “excess debt”, the difference between their actual level of public debt and the limit of 60% of GDP agreed on as one of the Maastricht criteria for euro entry."
5084| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|The EMF cannot be set up without a new treaty.
5084| European Monetary Fund|premise|Creation of the Fund faces many legal impediments.
5085| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|Investing EMF assets abroad could cause consternation.
5085| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""To ensure a credible commitment to crisis avoidance, the fund should be invested in non-European financial securities."
5086| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|European Monetary Fund undermines stability/unity of EU.
5086| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""The debt crisis in Greece has European economists befuddled--and clutching at ideas like establishing a European Monetary Fund, which is likely to undermine, not enhance, the stability of the European Union."
5087| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|Funding mechanisms could limit moral hazard of EMF.
5087| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""."
5088| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|European Monetary Fund would encourage fiscal irresponsibility.
5088| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""A fund could be seen by some countries as a ready-made bail-out facility."
5089| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|Solidarity around EMF matters more than moral hazard.
5089| European Monetary Fund|premise|"""Member countries of the EU have signed up to the principle of solidarity, which is enshrined in numerous passages of the Treaty."
5091| European Monetary Fund|conclusion|EMF funded proportional to GDP unpopular among big states.
5091| European Monetary Fund|premise|"A fund based on a percentage of their Gross National Production would burden Germany more than others: ""So that idea would certainly be a hard sale to German taxpayers,"" according to Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at the ING Group."
5095| European Union Expansion|conclusion|It is morally right to expand benefits of EU membership.
5095| European Union Expansion|premise|It is right to extend to Central and Eastern Europe the economic and political benefits enjoyed by existing EU members as they recover from the “dead hand” of a communist rule imposed after deals between the USSR and the USA and Britain at the end of World War II.
5096| European Union Expansion|conclusion|European Union should include all of Europe.
5096| European Union Expansion|premise|It would be hypocritical for a European Union not to embrace the geographical scope it claims within its own name.
5097| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Political corruption of eastern Europe threatens EU.
5097| European Union Expansion|premise|The ex-communist applicants often lack entrenched democracies and are sometimes prone to political corruption which could undermine the existing strengths of the Union.

5099| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU enlargement will increase cross-border trade.
5099| European Union Expansion|premise|As new EU members become more prosperous their citizens will consume more and more of the high-technology, luxury, and creative products and services produced by existing members.
5100| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU enlargement improves European living standards.
5100| European Union Expansion|premise|"""There will be a better quality of life for citizens throughout Europe as the new members adopt EU policies for protection of the environment and the fight against crime, drugs and illegal immigration."

5101| European Union Expansion|premise|"""Exchange of knowledge, technology, and new ideas will become easier with EU enlargement."
5102| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU enlargement will open countries to foreign competition.
5102| European Union Expansion|premise|"""Foreign competition from EU enlargement will improve business transparency and corporate accountability."
5103| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Economic integration and liberalization do not depend on EU.
5103| European Union Expansion|premise|"""accession to the EU is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for economic growth."
5104| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Expanding to include mostly poorer states will strain EU budget.
5104| European Union Expansion|premise|Even if expansion was limited to the six best candidates, the EU would gain 63 million people, adding 17% to its population but only $255 billion, or 3%, to its GDP.
5105| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU labor regulations will reduce productivity of new entrants.
5105| European Union Expansion|premise|Western European labor regulations will make many workers in the less-productive CEECs less competitive; agricultural subsidies will favor current EU members over future ones; and stringent environmental regulations will impose a cost of up to 120 billion euros on CEECs.
5106| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU environmental regulations will cost new member states.
5106| European Union Expansion|premise|"""By insisting on Western environmental standards, the EU will likely contribute to the prolongation of economic malaise in CEE."
5107| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU member states suffer from socialist economic environment.
5107| European Union Expansion|premise|"""Farmers can be excused for complaining that EU economic decisionmaking is eerily reminiscent of production quotas under Soviet occupation."
5108| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU expansion is good for current EU members politically.
5108| European Union Expansion|premise|It will extend to almost all of continental Europe a project which has ensured unprecedented levels of peace and cooperation among former enemies in western Europe for nearly half a century.
5110| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Economic interests are not represented by unelected EU bureaucracy.
5110| European Union Expansion|premise|"""The long-term economic wellbeing of the European peoples is incompatible with centralization of political and economic decisionmaking in the hands of the unelected bureaucracy in Brussels."
5111| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Expansion strains EU institution and hampers decision-making, action.
5111| European Union Expansion|premise|e.
5113| European Union Expansion|conclusion|EU expansion does not result in jobs migrations from east to west.
5113| European Union Expansion|premise|Current fears are similar to those voiced before the accession of the relatively poor Portugal, Greece and Spain to the EU, but in none of these cases was there a flood of poor workers to the richer states.
5114| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Free movement of new EU citizens will cause job migrations.
5114| European Union Expansion|premise|Free movement of workers within the EU threatens to flood richer current members with millions of poor job-seekers from the east, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people in the west who rely upon wages these migrants would undercut.
5115| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Enlargement may undermine Common Agricultural Policy, but for the better.
5115| European Union Expansion|premise|The CAP’s subsidies are costly, inefficient and bad for EU consumers.
5116| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Expansion could devastate farming in western Europe.
5116| European Union Expansion|premise|This is where land and labour costs and environmental standards are much higher than in the east.

5118| European Union Expansion|premise|Public opinion towards the EU among current members ranges from lukewarm to mildly hostile.
5120| European Union Expansion|conclusion|Enlargement strengthens EU's role in world affairs.
5120| European Union Expansion|premise|This will be true in foreign and security policy, trade policy, and the other fields of global governance.
5121| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|Europe has a developing strategic partnership with China.
5121| EU arms sales to China|premise|Europe and China will soon be each other's largest trading partner, and as China's rapid growth continues it is playing an increasingly important part in the global economy and in international affairs.
5122| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|"The idea of a ""strategic partnership"" with China is both vague and cause for concern."
5122| EU arms sales to China|premise|It is unclear what such a partnership would involve and questionable whether it is desirable.
5123| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|The arms ban is an anachronism.
5123| EU arms sales to China|premise|only China, Myanmar and Zimbabwe are singled out by the EU in this way from all the regimes in the world.
5124| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|China has changed over the past fifteen years, becoming more open to the world and more open domestically.
5124| EU arms sales to China|premise|For example it is experimenting with democratic elections at village level and talking of extending these to townships.
5125| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|The European Union should maintain the ban as a continued expression of disapproval for the Tienanmen square massacre and its legacy in modern China.
5125| EU arms sales to China|premise|The arms ban was imposed for a reason - the massacre of students demonstrating for democracy and openness in 1989.
5126| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|The current arms ban is purely symbolic, as China is already able to buy a range of military items from Europe.
5126| EU arms sales to China|premise|"555 million worth in 2003) and the USA, which has a similar ""ban"" on weapons sales to China."
5127| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|Lifting the arms ban will not strengthen China militarily.
5127| EU arms sales to China|premise|Not only would sales be restricted by the new code of conduct, but China has also clearly stated that it does not actually wish to purchase more military equipment from Europe.
5128| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|The arms ban is strategically effective in preventing the Chinese military from gaining access to the best modern technologies.
5128| EU arms sales to China|premise|A convincing code of conduct has yet to be drawn up, but even if it looks very tight, it has a major flaw.
5129| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|China poses a threat to regional and international peace and should not be encouraged and helped by European arms sales.
5129| EU arms sales to China|premise|It has territorial disputes with most of its neighbours, particularly over oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea.
5130| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|Lifting the arms ban will strengthen China militarily.
5130| EU arms sales to China|premise|The US fears less the Chinese purchase of EU weaponry and armour, than that the regime will get hold of advanced communications and control systems, as well as high-technology guidance systems, night-vision equipment, etc.
5133| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|Cooperating with China is the best way to gain influence with the regime in order to promote democracy and human rights.
5133| EU arms sales to China|premise|engage it internationally, etc.
5134| EU arms sales to China|conclusion|The European Union is taking a big risk in proposing to lift the arms ban.
5134| EU arms sales to China|premise|Firstly China may appear to be liberalising in some ways today, but there is no guarantee what an EU-armed China may look like in ten years time.
5135| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|conclusion|The EU lacks a common foreign policy and it's a problem.
5135| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|premise|"MEP Toomas Hendrik Ilves, vice chairman of the European Parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said in 2006, ""We should have a coordinated foreign policy; now we don’t have a common foreign policy on any matter."
5137| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|conclusion|New EU Foreign Minister marks commitment to a common foreign policy.
5137| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|premise|The recent agreement on the EU reform treaty and the creation of a post for an ‘EU Foreign Minister’ marks an important change in the decision making process at the EU level with regards to foreign policy.
5138| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|conclusion|The EU Foreign Minister position was controversial and is powerless.
5138| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|premise|While seemingly groundbreaking, the current agreement on the EU reform treaty was nothing but a lame attempt to salvage a much bolder initiative: an EU Constitution.
5139| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|conclusion|"""EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy"" was a major move forward."
5139| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|premise|While the new ‘EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy’ marks only a bold first step towards a more unified voice for the EU, the decisions are indeed still based on a state by state consultation mechanism – hence the name representative.
5140| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|conclusion|Moves toward a common foreign policy have been only nominal.
5140| EU Common Foreign and Security Policy|premise|This language is not much different from what we have heard with every attempt the EU has made to push for further political integration.

5185| EU elected president|conclusion|Strong presidential state powers are unnecessary and uncalled for.
5185| EU elected president|premise|Electing a President confers legitimacy on such a move and represents the inevitability of a European superstate, which is not necessarily desirable.
5186| EU elected president|conclusion|A government controlled by a single person would increase transparency.
5186| EU elected president|premise|Having too many heads results in the political process getting infested with red tapism and the likes of a bureaucratic state.
5187| EU elected president|conclusion|Election of a President focuses the accountability on one single individual.
5187| EU elected president|premise|The commission, Parliament, council and council ministers all have divergent interests and opinions and thus often speak in their own or a particular state's name rather than that of the entire union, confounding the problem.

5199| EU elected president|conclusion|EU population not involved enough to elect president.
5199| EU elected president|premise|"""How involved are the various peoples of the continent in the selection of their first permanent president? The answer: not very much."
5200| EU elected president|conclusion|Population differences lead to unfair elections.
5200| EU elected president|premise|In direct elections where each citizen can caste a vote, the difference in population of the various member states leads to an unjust election as candidates would focus only in those states where the population is the most as compared to those member states where the population is relatively less.
5201| EU elected president|conclusion|Elections would force EU politicians to act as populists.
5201| EU elected president|premise|Populist decisions are frequently not in the interests of the European Union.

5263| Fairness Doctrine|conclusion|Fairness Doctrine opens the door to government abuse.
5263| Fairness Doctrine|premise|"""FCC regulators would arbitrarily determine what ""fair access"" is, and who is entitled to it, through selective enforcement."
5264| Fairness Doctrine|conclusion|Enforcing the Fairness Doctrine would be too expensive.
5264| Fairness Doctrine|premise|"The Fairness Doctrine would be difficult to enforce, as it would require government officials oversee nearly every broadcasting network to ensure ""fair and balanced"" broadcasting."
5265| Fairness Doctrine|conclusion|Fairness Doctrine would counter conservative domination of radio.
5265| Fairness Doctrine|premise|"""Sinclair’s history of one-sided editorializing and right-wing water-carrying, which long preceded its Stolen Honor ploy (Extra!, 11–12/04), puts it in the company of political talk radio, where right-wing opinion is the rule, locally and nationally."

5270| Fairness Doctrine|premise|Sen.
5271| Fairness Doctrine|conclusion|Fairness Doctrine actually stifles public debate.
5271| Fairness Doctrine|premise|"""It sounds innocuous, even noble: In exchange for a license to use the public airwaves, broadcasters must demonstrate to the Federal Communications Commission that they are airing issues of public importance and reserving airtime for opposing views."
5272| Fairness Doctrine|conclusion|Fairness Doctrine remains important despite new media.

5290| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Argentina can claim Malvinas and uphold the way of life of inhabitants.
5290| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|"""The Argentine Nation ratifies its legitimate and imprescriptible sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich and the corresponding maritime and island spaces, as they are an integral part of the national territory."
5291| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|The Argentine population were not expelled, just the military personnel.

5298| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|The wishes of the current inhabitants of the islands should be paramount.
5299| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Britain expelled the military garrison in 1833, but did not expel the colony.
5299| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|There is ample evidence that Vernet's colony was not expelled during the British take over and not a shred of evidence that it was.

5302| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Geography is irrelevant.
5302| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|Just because somewhere looks close on a map of the world does not mean that they should belong to the nearest greater land mass.
5303| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|The Malvinas are far closer to Argentina  than Britain .

5326| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Britains rights are not justified by only a plaque, that is a ridiculous assertion.

5327| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Britain never relinquished its claim to the Falklands.
5327| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|"""The British never relinquished their claim to the Islands when they abandoned Port Egmont in 1774."

5329| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|This agreement could only be cancelled by agreement of the two nations.

5333| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|The Malvinas Islands were formerly ruled by Spain from Buenos Aires.

5337| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Argentina had no more right to Falklands than Britain.
5337| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|"""Britain insists that Argentina had no more right to claim inheritance of the Islands after she declared her independence from Spain in 1816 than over other separate and independent countries such as Uruguay and Paraguay."
5338| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Unilateral secession does not confer rights of territorial inheritance.
5338| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|A territorial inheritance or succession requires a territorial cession.

5344| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Britain never secretly agreed to give Falklands to Argentina.
5344| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|"""The British disavow knowledge of the ""secret understanding"" which Spain alleged was made prior to the signing of the exchange of peace declarations in 1771."
5345| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Argentina always claimed the Falklands.
5345| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|Great Britain abandoned its settlement in 1776, and formally renounced sovereignty in the Nootka Sound Convention.
5346| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Britain never renounced it's claim the Nookta Sound treaty supported the 1771 agreement.
5346| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|Also Argentine did renounce it's claim by failing to protest for two lengthy periods and by an all encompassing treaty between the two nations.
5347| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|In the 1771 agreement both the UK and Spain, respected each others claim for the islands.
5347| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|The Nookta Spund convention was signed after in 1790 and the 1771 agreement was not nullified but respected.
5348| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Nootka Sound Convention does not apply to UK in Falklands.
5348| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|It is debatable that it applies to the Falklands.
5349| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|The Nookta Sound convention did not affect Britains rights to the islands as they already had an agreement with Spain where both nations rights were secured in 1771.
5349| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|On the contrary, when Argentina interfered this allowed Britain to intervene as they were a third party, and had no right to be there.
5354| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|British occupation of Malvinas Islands perpetuates colonialism.
5354| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|Britain's control over the Falkland islands, a group of islands thousands of miles away, appears colonial in nature.
5355| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Britain exploiting Falkland Islands for natural resources.
5355| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|"""Buenos Aires has grown impatient with London’s refusal to enter negotiations over sovereignty, believing that Britain has abused its position to exploit fishing rights at the expense of Argentine trawlers."
5356| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|The UN resolution that deals with decoloization  does not demand it if the inhabitants don't want it, simple.
5356| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|The suggestion Britain and other nations with overseas territorites are judged badly for it is nonsense.
5357| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|You cannot return what was never theirs. The inheritance never happened, just a false claim.
5357| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|Argentina’s claims are also unproven in an international tribunal.
5358| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|Taking a 'colony' from one coloniser and giving it to another can hardly be right.
5358| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|The islanders have a right to self determination under the UN Charters and Resolutions.
5359| Falkland Islands, return of|conclusion|The Islands have been British since 1833.

5363| Falkland Islands, return of|premise|"Argentine Vice-President Daniel Scioli said in 2007, ""Once again, we urge the United Kingdom to heed international calls and resume negotiations in the appropriate manner, through the United Nations."

5486| File-sharing|premise|File-sharing opens users to a world of music.
5487| File-sharing|conclusion|File-sharing allows for pre-purchase sampling.
5487| File-sharing|premise|File-sharing helps the affected industry by allowing the consumer to sample the product before spending the money to purchase it.
5488| File-sharing|conclusion|Blank cassette tapes did not lead to economic problems as the industry feared.
5488| File-sharing|premise|From the 70s to the 80s, the RIAA fought for a tax on blank tapes Taintor.
5489| File-sharing|conclusion|The only artists making money off record royalties  are the extremely popular ones that already have a lot of money anyway.
5489| File-sharing|premise|Most musicians also live from touring and the sale of merchandise, and wider distribution of their songs is likely to increase their income from concerts, t-shirts, etc.
5490| File-sharing|conclusion|Music sales are actually up as a result of file-sharing.
5490| File-sharing|premise|The argument that sales are going to drop is completely wrong and it has been used with cassette tapes and CD burners before.
5491| File-sharing|conclusion|Massive copying has been occurring for a long time with little impact.
5491| File-sharing|premise|Such copying has occurred ever since the invention of tape cassettes and the increased economic impact of simpler access to copying provided by computer networks does not seem to have been large.
5492| File-sharing|conclusion|"According to ""The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales"" by Felix Oberholzer-Gee  and Koleman Strumpf, p2p services could actually work as marketing tools for the music industry."
5492| File-sharing|premise|Although file sharing has increased in recent years, so have online music sales.
5493| File-sharing|conclusion|By downloading music from the Internet one steals money from artists who are struggling to survive in the competitive music world.
5493| File-sharing|premise|A few stars are incredibly rich, but most musicians make only a modest living from the royalties on their songs, paid to them every time a record is bought or played on the radio.
5494| File-sharing|conclusion|Online free file-downloads have damaged legitimate sales.
5494| File-sharing|premise|As record sales drop, recording companies see no reason to support new artists anymore and are willing to sign up only pop stars that are sure to bring commercial success.
5495| File-sharing|conclusion|Unregulated file-sharing could reduce the appeal and quality of related industries.
5495| File-sharing|premise|If file sharing is allowed to continue unchecked and grow even larger, eventually more and more people will not feel the need to buy the media they want; instead they will download all of it.
5496| File-sharing|conclusion|The media industry might have to compensate for a lack of sales by raising prices of goods.
5496| File-sharing|premise|The film industry might raise ticket prices at movie theaters and the cost of DVDs, the music industry might start charging more for CDs, and the computer gaming industry could start charging more for its games.
5497| File-sharing|conclusion|The threat is greater than previous piracy technology because the distribution is practically free.
5497| File-sharing|premise|While it is claimed that the cassette tape's introduction had no impact on the music industry, the difference today is that the distribution costs of free file-sharing are virtually non-existent.

5502| File-sharing|conclusion|File sharing is not necessarily illegal.
5502| File-sharing|premise|Some artists may choose to support freeware, shareware, open source, or anti-copyright, and advocate the use of file sharing as a free promotional tool.
5503| File-sharing|conclusion|Trading Mp3 files is not like stealing a CD from a store.
5503| File-sharing|premise|Mp3 files are digital and considered intellectual property.
5504| File-sharing|conclusion|File sharing is illegal.
5504| File-sharing|premise|There exists a fair use clause of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act but that clause exists for the purpose of personal copying of CD's that are owned by an individual.

5516| Filibuster|premise|"""Instead of some loophole forcing a 60-vote majority, let's simply decide what the Senate should be."
5517| Filibuster|conclusion|Filibuster wrongly burdens majority party.
5517| Filibuster|premise|"Randy Barnett, one of the burgeoning field of Volokh conspirators, argued against the filibuster on the following grounds: ""The contemporary filibuster is a polite affair."
5518| Filibuster|conclusion|Constitution empowers Senate to set rule, including on filibuster.

5523| Filibuster|premise|"""The Founding Fathers would be appalled to learn that the framework they labored so valiantly to construct had been perverted by the filibuster."
5524| Filibuster|conclusion|Filibuster has been restricted.
5524| Filibuster|premise|The Filibuster has been consistently restricted through US history, in 1917 with the cloture rule and, in 1975, with the reduction of the number of votes required to end a filibuster from 67 to 60.
5525| Filibuster|conclusion|The filibuster only became acceptable in recent decades.
5525| Filibuster|premise|It was originally looked down upon in the 19th century, and hardly ever used.
5526| Filibuster|conclusion|The filibuster is outdated and uncivilized in a modern democracy.

5753| Funding for space exploration|premise|"""The curiosity of humans leads us to do many things."
5754| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|There is sufficient room for exploration on earth.
5754| Funding for space exploration|premise|Rather than probing Mars for life, we should be looking to the 95% of the world’s oceans that have yet to be explored and where we are constantly finding new forms of life and new scientific discoveries.
5755| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Manned space-flight has spawned many scientific innovations.
5755| Funding for space exploration|premise|The need to make equipment ‘fail-safe’ because of its role in keeping humans alive in space means that the level of funding and testing is necessarily higher than for non-manned missions.
5756| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|The scientific benefits of manned space programmes are severely overstated.
5756| Funding for space exploration|premise|NASA spends over a third of its budget simply keeping the ISS manned and the Space Shuttle working.
5757| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Few missions to space have produced notable scientific results.
5757| Funding for space exploration|premise|There are few experiments so important that they can justify the huge cost needed to allow them to be carried out by humans in zero gravity.
5758| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Going into space to discover the effects of space on humans is circular logic.
5758| Funding for space exploration|premise|The argument that humans need to be in space in order to find out the effects of being in space should be treated with caution; it is essentially a circular argument as with no manned missions, there would be no need to find out the impact of space on humans.
5759| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Public funding is necessary to achieve real results in space.
5759| Funding for space exploration|premise|While the private market may be able to cater for the rich few who want to see sub-orbital space (and some 11,000 have signed up to fly there with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactica from 2007), ultimately the boundaries of science involve keeping humans in space for long periods (the current record is 439 days), travelling further, discovering what the rest of our solar system holds and, eventually, trying to live on the moon or Mars.
5760| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Space programs have relatively small budgets.
5760| Funding for space exploration|premise|"""Space exploration is not a waste of money."
5761| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Space exploration is more valuable than some other human expenditures.

5764| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Private markets are better suited to invest in space exploration.
5764| Funding for space exploration|premise|What better way to colonise space than to leave it to the private market to develop the space tourism market to include space hotels and moon bases? The success of the $10m X Prize at attracting interest and private investment in private space programmes has shown that there is no need for the state to be involved in space travel on the non-science side.
5765| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Significant private capital can be raised for space exploration.
5765| Funding for space exploration|premise|Even if NASA is unwilling to fund a particular project does not mean it cannot take place – the Beagle 2 project to search for life on Mars was organised by British scientist Professor Colin Pillinger and raised a significant amount of its ?50m cost from private sources and sponsorship.
5766| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Humans should not rely solely on Earth for their long-term future.
5766| Funding for space exploration|premise|The potential damage done by an asteroid or comet that collides with the Earth could range from the impact of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima to the complete destruction of all life on the planet.
5767| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|The risk of us being wiped out by an asteroid like the dinosaurs is very very small.
5767| Funding for space exploration|premise|In any case unmanned missions (missiles, satellite mounted lasers etc.
5768| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Humans should not bank on destroying the Earth and moving to another planet.
5768| Funding for space exploration|premise|As for the potential for us to mess up the Earth sufficiently to require us to leave the planet, perhaps we should work harder at looking after this planet rather than looking for another one to damage.
5769| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|60% of Americans oppose funding a mission to Mars.
5769| Funding for space exploration|premise|"""Do you think the US should fund a Mars mission?"" 60% said no."
5770| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Mars mission is not first in the list of priorities.
5770| Funding for space exploration|premise|There are already enough problems at home into which the money could be invested.
5771| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Humans are able to make judgments in space exploration and testing.
5771| Funding for space exploration|premise|There is a distinction between collection of data and interpretation of data.
5772| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Robots are inefficient at collecting data.
5772| Funding for space exploration|premise|The most flexible robots yet to leave Earth, the Mars Rovers, could only travel a few metres and test some nearby rocks.
5773| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Humans must be in space in order to test the impact space has on them.
5773| Funding for space exploration|premise|Only by having humans in space that we are able to find out what the impact of space does to their physiological and psychological well being.
5774| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Manned missions force space-craft to have greater weight-bearing capacities for rocks.
5774| Funding for space exploration|premise|A second reason why manned experiments and exploration would be more effective is that any manned mission will necessarily be heavier.
5775| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Some spin-off technology will come from unmanned space travel as easily as from manned space travel.
5775| Funding for space exploration|premise|e.
5776| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Funding should only go to cost-effective robotic space exploration.
5776| Funding for space exploration|premise|"""Luckily, technology means that man can explore both the moon and Mars more fully without going there himself."
5777| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Multinational space programs are good for international diplomacy.
5777| Funding for space exploration|premise|Since the “historic handshake in space” when a US Apollo and Soviet Soyuz capsules docked in 1975, the two countries have grown increasingly close.
5778| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Flag-staking is occurring in space and spread nationalistic sentiments.
5778| Funding for space exploration|premise|Sending humans into space or to other planets so that they can erect the flag of a particular nation is a distinctly nationalistic act and one that is likely to create aggressive 'races' in the future just as it has before.
5779| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|Individuals are not always good at judging what is beneficial in the long term.
5779| Funding for space exploration|premise|If people are told they do not have to pay, they will probably choose not to pay.
5780| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|People should not be forced to contribute towards something they oppose.
5780| Funding for space exploration|premise|Even when people do not want to fund space travel, they are currently forced to do so.
5781| Funding for space exploration|conclusion|People can be trusted to make the right choices.
5781| Funding for space exploration|premise|When people are given the choice of whether they want contribute towards space travel, they are likely to choose the one that is best for themselves and society, whether space exploration or no space exploration is a better choice.

5956| Gay marriage|premise|"""Will the union of Mr."
5957| Gay marriage|conclusion|Straights have done more to weaken marriage than gays.
5957| Gay marriage|premise|"""The weakening of marriage has been heterosexuals' doing, not gays', for it is their infidelity, divorce rates and single-parent families that have wrought social damage."
5958| Gay marriage|conclusion|Gay marriage would reduce pressure on gays to marry straight.
5958| Gay marriage|premise|Without gay marriage, homosexuals are often pressured to marry straight, causing terrible emotional and social strife and undermining the institution of marriage.
5959| Gay marriage|conclusion|Gay marriage devalues the institution of marriage.
5959| Gay marriage|premise|It has been this way throughout history, regardless of religion, in ALL societies from primative to developed.
5960| Gay marriage|conclusion|Gay marriage devalues marriage, frequency of obtaining it.
5960| Gay marriage|premise|"""according to David Blankenhorn's book, The Future of Marriage, evidence suggests that when states adopt same-sex “marriage,” opposite-sex couples are more likely to decide that there is no need to get married prior to having children (cause and effect is an open question, but the correlation is definite)."

5973| Gay marriage|premise|"""Some have compared the prohibition of homosexual marriage to the prohibition of interracial marriage."
5974| Gay marriage|conclusion|All anti-gay-marriage arguments are ultimately anti-gay.
5974| Gay marriage|premise|"""I think that once you grant the essential premise, namely, the presumption of equality, there is only one basis for saying 'no' to Mr."
5975| Gay marriage|conclusion|Opponents of gay marriage are not simply anti-gay.
5975| Gay marriage|premise|"""Presumably, the mere fact that homosexuals are denied something that they value or desire proves that the resistance which they face is driven by 'hate."
5976| Gay marriage|conclusion|Being married is a source of stability and commitment.
5976| Gay marriage|premise|"""Being married is a source of stability and commitment for the relationship between spouses."
5977| Gay marriage|conclusion|Gay marriage encourages stable gay relationships/families.
5977| Gay marriage|premise|"""Allowing gays to marry would, if anything, add to social stability, for it would increase the number of couples that take on real, rather than simply passing, commitments."
5978| Gay marriage|conclusion|Marriage gives gays a sense of future, purpose, belonging.
5978| Gay marriage|premise|"""For today's generation of gay kids,   From the beginning, they will be able to see their future as part of family life — not in conflict with it."

5991| Gay marriage|conclusion|Gay marriage is separate issue from gay parenting.
5991| Gay marriage|premise|"""The question of children in homosexual households—adoption, especially—is thorny."
5992| Gay marriage|conclusion|Quality of parenting should not be a factor against gay marriage.
5992| Gay marriage|premise|This is because it is not a legal factor in ordinary marriages.
5993| Gay marriage|conclusion|Children always benefit from two parents, gay or straight.
5993| Gay marriage|premise|"""Numerous studies confirm that children of single parents fare less well than children in two-parent homes gay or straight in almost every respect - they are more likely to end up poor, addicted to drugs, uneducated, unemployed, and incarcerated."

6012| Gay marriage|conclusion|Laws are divinely inspired, depend on God's def of marriage.
6012| Gay marriage|premise|"""'Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure,' Jefferson asked, 'when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath?'  Our views on marriage are shaped not only by America’s laws, but by God’s laws."
6013| Gay marriage|conclusion|Churches should not have to offer gay marriage.
6013| Gay marriage|premise|"The state has an institution of it's own called the ""Civil Union""."
6014| Gay marriage|conclusion|Legalizing gay marriage will incite attacks on Churches.
6014| Gay marriage|premise|If gay marriages are sanctioned, religious organizations that don’t allow homosexual marriages and don’t recognize gay marriage as legitimate will come under attack for their beliefs and when preaching the bible.

6031| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""The fact is that there is not a shred of any evidence of risk to human health from GM crops."
6032| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|Millions have been consuming GM foods for some time and are OK.
6032| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""As of 2003, according to the FDA, more than 81% of soybeans and 40% of corn produced in the United States are genetically modified -- so you have probably been consuming genetically modified foods for quite some time."
6033| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops can be fortified with vitamins and vaccines.
6033| Genetically modified foods|premise|This means that specific diseases and/or vitamin deficiencies in a country can be combated with fortified GM foods.
6034| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|Foods with poisonous allergens can be modified to reduce risks.
6034| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""Another possibility is to genetically modify peanuts so that their proteins are less allergenic; this change could potentially save lives of the people who suffer from this dangerous allergy."
6035| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|Conventional foods have always involved genetic tampering.
6035| Genetically modified foods|premise|The most common forms of alteration have been cross-breeding and irradiation.
6037| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM food products should be judged.
6037| Genetically modified foods|premise|The scientific way of ensuring that crops are safe is to test the product, not the process.
6038| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|The anti-GMO principle that genetic tampering is bad is erroneous.
6038| Genetically modified foods|premise|Many anti-GMO advocates maintain that anything artificial or involving human tampering is morally bad.
6039| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|Concerns surrounding private controls of GM foods can be addressed.
6039| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""3) If the issue with GMOs is not related to health or safety but privatized food as part of a global, corporate managed-market then the issue is not genetic modification but privatization."
6040| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|There are many instances of GM foods proving dangerous.
6040| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""The recent episode in which the GM corn Starlink, deemed unfit for human consumption, found its way into consumer goods in grocery stores, attests to the real danger GM food posses to the public."
6041| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|Even if GM foods are safe, they are wrong on other grounds.

6042| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|The precautionary principle needs to be applied to GM food safety.
6042| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""Among the potential dangers of genetically modified food are the various health risks they could pose."
6043| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM food safety tests by biotech companies can be trusted.
6043| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""Because biotech goods have been determined to be GRAS they undergo no independent safety testing."
6044| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|Relying on scientists who favor GM foods undermines democratic processes.
6044| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""The problem with policy arguments that hinge on health and bio-pollution is that it takes the issue out of the hands of the public and puts it in the hands of scientists."
6045| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM foods are hazardously controlled by unaccountable corporations.
6045| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""To understand what GMOs are and how they affect our health and the environment we should at very least address the issue in terms of hazards rather than risks."
6046| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops are more pest-resistant and require fewer pesticides.
6046| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""These findings were reported by Graham Brookes and Peter Barfoot of PG Economics in a careful study of the global effects of GM crops in their first ten years of commercial use, from 1996 to 2005."
6047| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops require less pesticides.
6047| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""This cotton benefits farmers because it reduces the need for insecticides, thereby increasing their income and also improving their health."
6048| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops may require more pesticides in the long-run.
6048| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""Advocates of GM crops argue that GM crops are good for the environment since they will reduce the amount of agrochemicals (pesticides and herbicides) that need to be used in crop production."
6049| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops generate greater wealth for farming communities.
6049| Genetically modified foods|premise|Lower production costs should extrapolate to lower food costs and improved production should ensure greater wealth in farming communities and a more stable food supply.
6050| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|The lower crop production costs of GM foods reduce prices.
6050| Genetically modified foods|premise|Lower production costs should extrapolate to lower food costs and improved production should ensure greater wealth in farming communities and a more stable food supply.
6051| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops can be tailored to local growing conditions.
6051| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""Whether this material is genetically modified, open pollinated or hybrid, it benefits from having the genetic background best suited to the local growing conditions."
6052| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops can respond better to fertilizer.
6052| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""The Green Revolution was, in part, made possible by dwarfing genes that made wheat grow short and strong, so that it could respond to fertiliser without collapsing and concentrate the plant's energy into producing bigger ears and thus more grain."
6053| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM food companies are being strangled by opposition, regulation.
6053| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""The scientific way of ensuring that crops are safe is to test the product, not the process."
6054| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops are often problematic and less productive.
6054| Genetically modified foods|premise|How does the use of agrochemicals affect Filipino farmers? It started with the Green Revolution in the 70s which farmers were almost forced to join as the use of “high yielding varieties” was then part and parcel of the bogus land reform programme of the Marcos dictatorship.

6065| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM crops can be mismatched with ecosystems, as can conventional crops.
6065| Genetically modified foods|premise|"""Some opponents of GM crops, who seem to have realised that the argument based on lack of safety has no basis, now focus their opposition on environmental concerns, arguing that GM crops destroy biodiversity."
6066| Genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM animals can be made sterile.
6066| Genetically modified foods|premise|"According to The Economist ""Dawn of the Frankenfish"", Technology Quarterly, June 2010, developing fish eggs can be subjected to high pressures, which ""alters their complement of chromosomes, giving them three sets per cell instead of the usual two."

6338| Globalization|premise|Globalization is, in effect, a process in which people give up individualism in exchange for homogenization, or belonging.
6341| Global tax|conclusion|World poverty and currency crises are unlikely to be solved through a global tax.
6341| Global tax|premise|Although lack of funds is often given as the main problem in addressing world poverty and humanitarian crises, much writing on development now agrees that the North-South gap will not be narrowed through a mere transfer of funds.
6342| Global tax|conclusion|A global tax could raise billions of dollars/year that could easily be used to fund UN aid efforts.
6342| Global tax|premise|Given the current levels of poverty in the world and the desperate situations that we have seen emerging over and over again in the developing world (e.
6343| Global tax|conclusion|The Tobin Tax would be a way to ensure that there is a stable, yearly contribution to a global relief fund, most likely administered by the United Nations.

6344| Global tax|conclusion|A global tax would move us in the right direction in terms of management of new global concerns, including environmental, economical and political.
6344| Global tax|premise|As an international mechanism for solving global financial problems, a Tobin tax would provide a precedent that could be followed to address other issues.
6345| Global tax|conclusion|The revenue-collection process is likely to be politicized.
6345| Global tax|premise|Given that the Tax, if implemented, will most likely have to be enforced by each country individually, with funds later to be transferred to the UN, there is little chance that the process would be apolitical.
6346| Global tax|conclusion|The Tobin Tax would ease the international relief, aid and intervention burden that usually falls on the United States’ shoulders.
6346| Global tax|premise|By empowering the United Nations and possibly funding a UN army, the burden would be shifted from the USA to the UN and will be managed in a more neutral and fair way.
6348| Global tax|conclusion|A Tobin Tax would put an unfair burden on important currencies.
6348| Global tax|premise|A global tax could potentially be a solution to larger global concerns, such as the environment or humanitarian crises, but the Tobin tax would place the burden mainly on important currencies as opposed to all world countries.
6350| Global tax|conclusion|A global tax would be unfamiliar to most people.
6350| Global tax|premise|While most people do want to see a world free of poverty, the average person is not familiar with the detailed workings of the world currency market or the difference between having the UN do what it currently does and being funded through this new tax.
6351| Global tax|conclusion|The Tax is easily enforceable.
6351| Global tax|premise|There are two main enforcement mechanisms that could be adopted: 1) taxation of currency trading desks in a particular jurisdiction and 2) taxation of a particular currency.
6352| Global tax|conclusion|While the tax would originally be set at 0.01%, there is always the possibility that the tax would be raised up to even 50%.
6352| Global tax|premise|This, in fact, is the way in which Tobin proposed that the tax would be able to manage speculative attacks on a particular currency.

6364| Google decision to stop censoring results in China|conclusion|Stopping Google censorship improves user experience long-term.
6364| Google decision to stop censoring results in China|premise|While it is true that the effect of Google stopping the censorship of its results may cause the site to be banned from China (which is not good for Chinese users in the short-term), the long-term objective is to increase access to information for Chinese users by pressuring the Chinese government to loosen its censorship laws.
6365| Google decision to stop censoring results in China|conclusion|Google's decision to leave China harms Chinese users.

6643| Guest workers in the United States|premise|"""After the Senate Judiciary Committee put out a guest-worker bill, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney issued a statement saying: ""Guest-workers programs are a bad idea and harm all workers."
6647| Guest workers in the United States|conclusion|AFL-CIO is opposed.

6650| Gun control|conclusion|Right to BEAR ARMS is an individual not collective right.
6650| Gun control|premise|In the court case Heller v District of Columbia the court ruled that the right to bear arms has always existed and that the court case only affirms that right.
6652| Gun control|conclusion|A government may be justified in adopting lax gun-control laws as a means to national defense.
6652| Gun control|premise|Lax gun control laws and the diffusion of weapons in a society, better enable a country to defend itself.
6653| Gun control|conclusion|Gun control would increase black market demand for guns.
6653| Gun control|premise|Increased sales make the black market a very profitable business for criminals, thereby increasing criminal activy.
6654| Gun control|conclusion|Guns don’t kill people – people kill people.
6654| Gun control|premise|The argument here is that sociological factors are more important than the availability of weapons in determining gun violence and deaths in societies.
6656| Gun control|conclusion|Criminals will find a way to commit crimes and violence with or without guns.
6656| Gun control|premise|Guns are not the only means of violence and crime.
6657| Gun control|conclusion|Because guns used in murders and crime are not usually legally held or registered, efforts to enhance gun-protection through legal means are futile.
6657| Gun control|premise|Some have pointed out that in the vast majority of crimes involving firearms, the gun used is not legally held or registered.
6658| Gun control|conclusion|Gun restrictions and bans disadvantage citizens against armed criminals.
6658| Gun control|premise|Gun laws restrict the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry guns and defend themselves, but they do not restrict the ability of unlawful individuals to acquire guns in the black market and use them against defenseless citizens.
6659| Gun control|conclusion|Clinton administration study finds gun laws don't correlate with crime.
6659| Gun control|premise|A study originally commissioned by the Clinton Administration, in 2003 the study found that strict gun laws could not be correlated with crime statistics.
6660| Gun control|conclusion|Reducing the prevalence of guns reduces crime.
6660| Gun control|premise|Legal boundaries for gun-ownership may not provide sufficient social protections, as many criminals steal legally-owned guns, and commit violent crimes or murder with them.
6661| Gun control|conclusion|Legal gun owners sometimes turn their gun on others.
6661| Gun control|premise|Legal gun-owners frequently commit murder with their legally-owned gun.
6662| Gun control|conclusion|Guns make suicide too easy argument.
6662| Gun control|premise|Some groups maintain that there is a correlation between the laxity of a country’s gun laws and its suicide rate – not because gun owners are more depressive, but because the means of quick and effective suicide is easily to hand.
6663| Gun control|conclusion|Households with guns have a much greater risk of homicide.
6663| Gun control|premise|In homes with guns, a member of the household is almost three times as likely to be the victim of a homicide compared to gun-free homes.
6664| Gun control|conclusion|Self-defense with a gun is rare.
6664| Gun control|premise|"""Handguns Are Not Viable Tools For Self-Defense: The alleged value of handguns as tools for self-defense is a major underpinning of Mr."
6665| Gun control|conclusion|Burglars often break into houses to steal guns.
6665| Gun control|premise|Guns in a household can actually provide an incentive for criminals to break into a house, increasing the risks for gun owners.
6666| Gun control|conclusion|Fatal exchanges often occur because an innocent person decides to draw out a gun on an assailant.
6666| Gun control|premise|"Criminals often decide to shoot a citizen only after the citizen pulls out a gun in ""self-defense""."
6674| Gun control|conclusion|Past problems do not condemn wiser gun control in the future.
6674| Gun control|premise|Just because gun control has been misused in the past does NOT mean that it will be misused now.
6675| Gun control|conclusion|Shooting sports do not a require a fully automatic weapon.
6675| Gun control|premise|Most armed threats that an average civilian will face can be easily stopped with a semi automatic weapon.
6676| Gun control|conclusion|Increased gun ownership has coincided with decreased accidents.
6676| Gun control|premise|National Center for Health Statistics, between 2003-2004 gun accident deaths in the United States fell 11 percent and the per capita rate of such accidents fell 12 percent, to their lowest points in recorded history.
6680| Gun control|conclusion|The failure of the British police to crack-down on arms-trafficking is an example of the enforceability of gun-restriction laws.
6680| Gun control|premise|"""British police, unhampered by the Fourth Amendment, have nevertheless been unable to stem illegal arms traffic-even with the special search and other powers which successive gun prohibition bills have given them."
6682| Gun control|conclusion|Guns sports should be protected and justify gun ownership.
6682| Gun control|premise|Shooting is sport enjoyed by many law-abiding people, both in gun clubs with purpose-built ranges and as a field sport.
6683| Gun control|conclusion|Gun sports have economic benefits.
6683| Gun control|premise|Field sports bring money into poor rural economies and provide a motivation for landowners to value environmental protection.
6684| Gun control|conclusion|Gun sports are socially desensitizing and damaging.
6684| Gun control|premise|Shooting as a sport has the potential to desensitize people to the lethal nature of all firearms, creating a gun culture that glamorizes and legitimizes unnecessary gun ownership.
6685| Gun control|conclusion|When citizens carry concealed weapons, criminals fear the risks of committing crimes and are deterred.
6685| Gun control|premise|Criminologist Wright and Rossi in 1982 and 1983 interviewed felons in prison regarding deterrence.
6686| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook news feeds generally makes people feel exposed and invaded.
6686| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|"Danah Boyd, social networking scholar and blogger noted in 2006, ""privacy is an experience that people have, not a state of data."
6687| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Many Facebook users don't understand the privacy implications of allowing news feeds .

6689| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Given that anyone can submit anything on Facebook, it means that this person can share any information about any individual without permission.
6690| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Commercial reasons not to promote tight security.
6690| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Facebook does not motivate its users to secure their profiles and personal information more, because it has financial incentives to yield as much information from the users as possible.
6691| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook's news-feed now has an off-switch, giving users the choice to adjust privacy settings.
6691| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Choice is essential to privacy.
6692| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Public information has a moderating effect on individuals.
6692| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|It is good that information about individuals is made more public.
6693| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Social networking sites distract from quality interpersonal connections.
6693| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|The most valuable connections are not made over the Internet but in person-to-person interactions.
6694| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook undermines the value of interpersonal relationships.
6694| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Facebook restricts communication to a couple of words or sentences, instead of promoting real personal contact.
6695| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook causes the harmful spread of gossip.
6695| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|As anything can be said on Facebook and anyone with the correct permissions can comment there is a risk of a gossip spread.
6697| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook is a symptom, not a cause.
6697| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Our society is changing dramatically and Facebook is a mere byproduct of these changes.
6698| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Social networking sites make it possible to maintain fictional identity.
6698| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|"Social networking sites allow people to create a ""mask"" and claim to be a completely different person from who they really are."
6699| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook suits criminals perfectly.
6699| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|"Thanks to ""open"" privacy setting and the main purpose of Facebook - sharing as much information as possible - this social networking site becomes a safe haven for stalkers, pedophiles, etc."
6700| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Information is disclosed and shared voluntarily and based on privacy setting.
6700| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Users are rational people who can protect themselves by adjusting privacy settings and choosing which information they want to share.
6701| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Social networking sites are a major distraction from learning.
6701| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|People are spending far too much time on social networking sites, and away from books, newspapers, and other educational resources.
6702| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook fosters hate speech.
6702| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|"Racist, xenophobic, extremist and other ""hate speech"" groups attract hundreds of members, who are not prosecuted, although hate speech is (in most countries) illegal."
6703| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Inappropriate content is not restricted by age.
6703| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|"Even though Facebook - in theory - tries to prevent young children from having their own profile, in practice are its controls ineffective, as the only ""proof"" of someone's age is his or her own confirmation."
6704| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook promotes freedom of speech.
6704| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Facebook is sometimes the only tool to express someone's opinion in a politically unfree country that restricts basic human rights and freedoms.
6705| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook can be used for educational purposes.
6705| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Because Facebook makes information- and file-sharing easier, it is an ideal tool for students to share materials or discuss important issues.
6706| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook is too interconnected.
6706| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Facebook not only helps spread information in form of videos, texts, and pictures, but it also reaches wide audience.
6707| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|All possible harms are not unique to Facebook.
6707| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Privacy issues, cyberbullying, inappropriate content.

6709| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Certain fan pages or groups can be edifying, informing about different cultures, religions, traditions.
6710| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|A weapon cannot be separated from a murderer.
6710| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Facebook is a powerful tool to do harm, and although this harm is, in effect, done by people, it is carried out through this website, which enables them to do so.
6711| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Guns don't kill people.
6711| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|It is not Facebook doing harm, it is its users.
6712| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Facebook enhances stereotypes.
6712| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|"There are many groups and fan pages that enhance our cultural biases, ranging from ""Heyy Babe Lets Put Up The England Flags."
6714| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|It is unethical for social network sites to use personal information to enable advertisers to better target you as a consumer.
6714| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|Personal information should not be used for commercial purposes.
6715| Harmfulness of Facebook|conclusion|Social networking sites have agreements that explicitly say that information can be used commercially in any way.
6715| Harmfulness of Facebook|premise|If an individual doesn't want their information to be used commercially, than they shouldn't enter into agreements with these social networking sites.

6720| Has globalization worsened international terrorism?|premise|Better educated people are less likely to be ideological extremists.
6721| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crimes terrorize communities and so deserve greater punishment.
6721| Hate crime laws|premise|Hate crimes don't merely victimize the individual upon which violence is inflicted.
6722| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime is a major problem, requiring a state response.
6722| Hate crime laws|premise|As described above, hate crimes can cause serious apprehensions between communities.
6724| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crimes cannot be proven to harm communities.
6724| Hate crime laws|premise|It is difficult to determine externalities of harm to a community or a minority group from a particular hate crime.
6725| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Communities fear senseless violence as much as hate violence.
6725| Hate crime laws|premise|While much of the case for hate crimes is based on the notion that hate crimes cause minority groups and communities to fall victim to the fear that this violence causes, it is not clear that this is any worse than the fear that results from senseless non-hate gang violence.
6726| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws don't restrict religious speech on homosexuality.
6726| Hate crime laws|premise|Hate crime laws only target hate-driven violence.
6727| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws don't violate US first amendment.
6727| Hate crime laws|premise|The US Supreme Court ruled in R.
6728| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws violate religious free speech.
6728| Hate crime laws|premise|This is particularly true in regard to the expression of religious opposition to homosexuality, in which a preacher's public statements against homosexuality might be interpreted as incitements to violence against homosexuals.
6729| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws violate free speech more than hate crimes themselves.
6729| Hate crime laws|premise|Such legislation essentially penalizes the thoughts, emotions, or motives behind an act.
6730| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Some groups don't need hate crime legal protections.
6730| Hate crime laws|premise|While some argue that it is unfair that white Christian groups are not protected in the same way as certain minority groups, this ignores the fact that white Christian groups are really not threatened categorically, and, therefore, there is simply no need for laws that would protect them.
6731| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws protect all groups equally.
6731| Hate crime laws|premise|The ultimate intent of hate crime laws is to make all citizens equally safe and protected.
6732| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws provide special protections like other laws do.
6732| Hate crime laws|premise|Various civil rights movements around the world have extended extra securities and protections to minority groups that have been discriminated against.
6733| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Danger of arbitrary rulings accompanies hate crime laws.
6733| Hate crime laws|premise|There is a danger of unjustly branding someone as bigoted and punishing them excessively, e.
6734| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws are likely to be abused by accusers.
6734| Hate crime laws|premise|Victims of violence may be prone to accusing their assailant of hate-motivated crimes.
6735| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws tie the hands of judges.
6735| Hate crime laws|premise|There are often subtleties in a particular case that make it important that judges have the flexibility to reach a balanced and just conclusion.
6736| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws force false categorizations of minority groups.
6736| Hate crime laws|premise|A hate crime is perpetrated against a particular minority group that is determined as needing of protection.
6737| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws are politically motivated.
6737| Hate crime laws|premise|It is very difficult to oppose hate crime laws, as they are intuitively attractive and are highly important to minority group constituents while being more under-the-radar for the general public.
6738| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Gays and lesbians need special protections from hate crimes.
6738| Hate crime laws|premise|Studies indicate that gas and lesbians are at exceptional risk of becoming the victims of hate-motivated violence.
6739| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Transgender people need protections against hate crimes.
6739| Hate crime laws|premise|Transgender people have been victims of a substantial number of hate crimes.
6741| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws can help emphasize the importance of tolerance.
6741| Hate crime laws|premise|When a government or society finally commits to a position that says acts of hate are unacceptable, people holding these negative beliefs are urged to reconsider their values.
6742| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws target violent acts not thoughts.
6742| Hate crime laws|premise|Some opponents of hate crimes argue that you can't outlaw hate, and that this is what hate laws attempt to do.
6743| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate is a learned attribute.
6743| Hate crime laws|premise|Hate crime laws can teach society that hatred is highly condemnable and mold society into a streak away from racism, sexism, etc.
6744| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate crime laws won't change hatred.
6744| Hate crime laws|premise|Often people who hold racist views, or are committed to other ideologies of hate, are unwilling or unable to change their views.
6745| Hate crime laws|conclusion|Hate Crime laws would only INCREASE racial tension.
6745| Hate crime laws|premise|Since the application of hate crimes involve enhancements, then there is governmental favoritism.
6750| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops are non-profits, not run by government nor companies.
6750| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Senator Kent Conrad, a ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee and the figure originally proposing co-ops, said co-ops ""have some of the strengths of public option in that they are not for profit and will provide competition for the insurance companies."
6751| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Non-profit co-ops are driven by health interests of members, not profits.
6751| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|The CEO of HealthPartners, Mary Brainered, says that the health insurance co-op has an advantage because it is not beholden to shareholders.
6752| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|There should be more non-profit co-op insurers.
6752| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""The case for co-ops is simple: we don't have enough non-profit insurers."
6753| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Non-profit co-ops scale widely without profit incentive.
6753| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|While many social entrepreneurs may find, in the goodness of their hearts, the will to start a non-profit co-op, most people are not willing to invest the initial and sustained effort in something that does not provide increasing returns and profits over time.
6754| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Non-profit co-ops are less efficient without for-profit interest.
6754| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|The for-profit interest is very important in driving efficiency within organizations, as it offers administrators the incentive to cut costs and increase efficiency so as to increase revenues, profits, share-holder confidence, and administrative fees.
6755| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Insurance industry needs more competition, not co-ops.
6755| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""Our health-care system needs real reform ."
6756| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops compete with insurers like public option could.
6756| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Kent Conrad (D-ND), head of the Senate Finance Committee: ""The strength of this proposal is that it accomplishes much of what those who want a public option are calling for — that is, something to compete with private for-profit insurance companies."
6757| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops are a great alternative to the public option.
6757| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"President Barack Obama said in Colorado in mid August, 2009: ""The public option, whether we have it or we don't have it, is not the entirety of health care reform."
6758| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops complete strong non-profit, private, public mix.
6758| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""I’ll say that I think  a pretty good idea, but it stands on its own merits completely apart from the merits of a public plan."
6759| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Non-profit co-ops are great, but no substitute for public insurance.
6759| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|While it is entirely true that co-ops are a great option, and should be encouraged, they are not a substitute for a national insurance plan.
6760| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Public insurance has succeeded internationally, co-ops have not.
6760| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|In reflecting on reforming the United States health care system, it is important to look abroad for examples.
6761| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health insurance co-ops are a ploy to defeat public insurance.
6761| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Yale University professor Jacob S.
6762| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health insurance co-ops can scale to compete with private insurers.
6762| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Sen.
6763| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Insurance co-ops self-sustaining, need no taxpayer support.
6763| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Sen.
6764| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops can scale in a decentralized and community-focused manner.
6764| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|It is not a necessary factor for individual co-ops to be able to scale.
6765| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops are more community-focused than insurance companies.
6765| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Darla Andrews, a member of the Minneapolis-based Health Partners, was reported saying in an August 2009 CNN article: ""I like the small community feel of here."
6766| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops cannot scale to compete with insurers like public plan.
6766| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Sanjay Gupta said on Anderson Cooper 360 in August of 2009: ""looking at a lot of these historical knowledge of co-ops, unless you get scale -- hundreds of thousands of people participating -- it is hard for a co-op to compete against a private insurance company, which is why the people who are such supporters of the public option are crying foul."
6767| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health insurance co-ops cannot scale as quickly as public insurance.
6767| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|A public plan can scale within two to five years, with massive injections of public funds.
6768| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health co-ops cannot scale to solve problem of uninsured.
6768| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|This is an extension of the above argument that co-ops have trouble scaling, but focuses on the outcome of solving the massive problem of around 47 million uninsured Americans.
6769| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops lack scale to negotiate prices of drugs, services.
6769| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""cooperatives would lack the scale and authority to negotiate lower rates with drug companies and other providers, collect wide data on outcomes, or effect major change in the system."
6770| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops are a successful model for health insurance.
6770| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""The co-op concept is also longstanding and widespread in the insurance sector, where it is known as a ""mutual"" insurance company."
6771| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Widespread co-op model can succeed in health insurance.
6771| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"North Dakota Democrat Kent Conrad said in a June 2009 interview with Ezra Klein: ""the co-op model has proven very effective across many different models."
6772| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health insurance co-ops are too unestablished to rely on.
6772| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Timothy Stoltzfus, a law professor at Washington and Lee University and a writer on health care policy, said in August of 2009: ""The fact that not many  exist now shows us there's not a viable model to compete with private insurers."
6773| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health care co-ops have a history of insolvency and failure.
6773| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""apart from Group Health and Health Partners, the history of nonprofit HMOs is littered with failures."
6774| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops will not necessarily work in health insurance.
6774| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""As it turns out, faith in health insurance co-ops comes from a lot of examples that don't have anything to do with health care, even remotely! As pretty CNN hologram Jessica Yellin explained to birther fanatic Lou Dobbs, health care co-ops proponent Senator Kent Conrad was specifically inspired by an entirely different kind of co-op."
6775| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Non-profit co-ops have lower administrative costs and premiums.
6775| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Sanjay Gupta: ""If you look at the co-op across the board they have a couple of things going for them."
6776| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops would compete with and improve health insurance.
6776| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""Q: How could a co-op offer a better alternative?  A: Co-ops presumably would reduce or eliminate some costs, including profits, to compete effectively with private insurers."
6777| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health insurance co-ops have difficulty controlling costs and premiums.
6777| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""Despite efforts to negotiate lower premiums, cooperatives have only been able to offer premiums that are comparable to those in the general small group market."
6778| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Rates between health care co-ops varies significantly.
6778| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""Rates could also vary dramatically, depending on regional differences in health costs and the size and makeup of co-op pools."
6779| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops are equally inefficient as public insurance.
6779| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""As a concept, health insurance co-ops are attractive because ostensibly, they would be run by the consumer, for the benefit of the consumer, and with no profit motive, premiums theoretically should be cheaper."
6781| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops implement a more holistic, preventive approach.
6781| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""Dr."
6782| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Democratic nature of health insurance co-ops enhances quality.
6782| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, said in June of 2009: ""The democratic nature of co-ops could encourage increased quality and appropriate utilization and could help foster care integration and other delivery system reforms""."

6789| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Gov.
6790| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Political difficulty of public insurance is no argument against it.
6790| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|That something is political difficult, with significant opposition, does not mean it is a bad idea.
6791| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|"""Not enough votes"" does not justify voting no."
6791| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Many Senators argue that there are not enough votes for a public plan (60 are needed for a ""filibuster proof"" majority)."
6792| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops are non-profits and avoid government control.
6792| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Kent Conrad, a ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, who originally proposed co-ops as an alternative to the public option in June of 2009, said: "" meets the objections of many Republicans and some Democrats as well."
6793| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Some government involvement in co-ops is justified.
6793| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Government involvement is not toxic.
6794| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Health insurance co-ops are self-sustaining, not taxpayer-dependent.
6794| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Sen.
6795| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Insurance co-ops will require government involvement/problems.
6795| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""It would be an enormously complex undertaking — almost as difficult as trying to establish nationalized health care."
6796| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Co-ops are a slippery slope to socialized medicine.
6796| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"""There are slippery slope arguments against health insurance co-ops as well."
6797| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Advocates of co-ops are really aiming for socialized medicine.
6797| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Senator Jim DeMint (R-S.
6798| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Supporters of co-ops will never reduce government involvement.
6798| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|Taxpayers and politicians are likely to become too invested in co-ops to ever agree to eliminate or even reduce the government's likely role in them.
6799| Health insurance cooperatives|conclusion|Government may never let health insurance co-ops fail.
6799| Health insurance cooperatives|premise|"Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, said the alternative being thrown out by the administration raises many questions: ""would the government ever allow this entity to fail? If not, then you'd have the health care version of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."

6803| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates counteract insurers denying coverage to the unhealthy.
6803| Health insurance mandates|premise|exclusion periods for coverage of preexisting conditions, benefit riders that permanently exclude particular types of care, higher premium rates or cost-sharing requirements for people with health problems, and outright denials of coverage.
6804| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Uninsured increase costs for all.
6804| Health insurance mandates|premise|The uninsured do two things that add to costs.
6805| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Uninsured degrade care for all.
6805| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""When a significant number of patients is unable to pay for care, such as the 20 percent of Americans currently in that situation, not only do costs increase for everyone but quality of care decreases, as limited human and material resources are drained to support those unable to financially contribute to the system."
6806| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates limit freedoms of few to protect freedoms of many.
6806| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""While some complain about the loss of personal freedoms for a few, avoiding mandates would lead to further unnecessary yet significant financial burdens for everyone."
6807| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandatory insurance violates right of individual judgement.
6807| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Mandatory insurance violates the rights of insurers and individuals to act on their own judgment."
6808| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandatory insurance violates right to engage in contracts.
6808| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Mandatory insurance violates individual rights in several ways."
6809| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates protect taxpayers from burden of uninsured.
6809| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""A mandate to buy what? In automobile insurance it’s typically to protect other people against the damage the driver might do to them."
6810| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Uninsured free-riders are no big problem.
6810| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""how big is the free-rider problem, really? First, we should note that not all free riders are uninsured."
6811| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates are best way to get to universal coverage.
6811| Health insurance mandates|premise|"Bradley Herring, a health economist at Johns Hopkins University: ""Without an individual mandate, you're never going to get to universal coverage."
6812| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|General statements in favor of health insurance mandates.
6812| Health insurance mandates|premise|"Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat who is helping write healthcare legislation, in a March 2009 speech to the Center for American Progress think tank said, ""An individual obligation to get health coverage is essential."
6813| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates will not produce universal care as many will not comply.
6813| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""The Problem of Noncompliance  of course, the mandate will not work exactly as planned."
6814| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Premise of insurance mandates, that health care is a right, is false.
6814| Health insurance mandates|premise|Many argue that health care is a right, and thus that universal health care is a necessary provision.
6821| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandatory health insurance ensures appropriate pooling of risk.
6821| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""'Insurance, in its simplest form, works by pooling risks: many pay a premium up front, and then those who face a bad outcome (getting sick, being in a car accident, having their home burn down) get paid out of those collected premiums,' explained Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at Harvard’s School of Public Health."
6822| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Without mandates insurers focus on risk instead of costs.
6822| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""the voluntary insurance system has also distracted insurers from developing incentives and mechanisms for efficiently managing health care costs."
6823| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates include young and healthy, spread risk and costs.
6823| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Bringing everyone into the insurance pool -- particularly young, healthy customers -- spreads the risk and lowers overall costs."
6824| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Insurance mandates require costly government subsidies.
6824| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Costs to the state government have skyrocketed and are projected to run hundreds of millions of dollars over budget."
6825| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Insurance mandates force citizens to buy special-interest benefits.
6825| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Under any system of mandatory insurance, the government must necessarily define what constitutes acceptable insurance."
6826| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Only markets, not mandates, reduce cost of insurance.
6826| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""But the kind of centralized, government-dominated proposals he endorses elsewhere in his letter have a poor track record of producing the savings he needs for this plan to work."
6829| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Health insurance mandates need not be perfectly enforced to be effective.
6829| Health insurance mandates|premise|The most important thing with health insurance mandates - and penalties for non-compliance - is that they create a general incentive to buy insurance and a general discouragement of going without.
6830| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandatory health insurance has strong bipartisan support.
6830| Health insurance mandates|premise|Thus necessary policies can be easily implemented.
6831| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandatory health insurance cannot be effectively enforced.
6831| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""consider that those who refuse to get insurance may be fined."
6832| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Health insurance mandates preserve markets, limit govt.
6832| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""The answer proposed by John Kerry and John Edwards is to continue the creeping socialization of medicine that Americans have been experiencing since the 1960s."
6833| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Less government, not more, is answer for uninsured.
6833| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Liberals are wrong when they blame the failure of the Massachusetts plan on the free market."
6834| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Health insurance mandates do not foster responsibility.
6834| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Nor does mandatory health insurance promote “personal responsibility,” as conservatives claim."
6835| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates in society are very rare and exceptional.
6835| Health insurance mandates|premise|"A Congress Budget Office report on the 1994 health insurance proposals of the Clinton Administration in the United States: ""A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action."
6836| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandatory health insurance is analogous to mandatory car insurance.
6836| Health insurance mandates|premise|Mandatory car insurance is accepted as an important and necessary means of protecting other drivers, so too should health insurance mandates be accepted as a means of protecting other taxpayers.
6837| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Auto insur. mandate is for other drivers, not like health insur. mandate.
6837| Health insurance mandates|premise|"Former Department of Health and Human Services officials Peter Urbanowicz and Dennis Smith wrote for the Federalist Society: ""The primary purpose of the auto insurance mandate was to provide financial protection for people that a driver may harm, and not necessarily for the driver himself as health insurance mandates do."
6838| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Auto insur. mandate is avoidable, unlike health insur. mandate.
6838| Health insurance mandates|premise|"Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute: ""You can avoid the auto insurance mandate by divesting yourself of a car."
6839| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|"Auto insurance is ""quid pro quo"" for license to drive."
6839| Health insurance mandates|premise|The state issues drivers licenses as a privileged.
6840| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|MA insurance mandates are performing pretty well.
6840| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""I’ve been getting a fair bit of mail from people who have heard that things are going very badly in Massachusetts."
6841| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandatory health insurance has failed in Massachusetts.
6841| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""Three years ago, Massachusetts adopted a plan requiring all residents to purchase health insurance, with state subsidies for lower-income residents."
6842| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates are less radical than a single-payer system.
6842| Health insurance mandates|premise|A single-payer system is very radical in places such as the United States, requiring the complete abolition of the insurance industry.
6843| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates unnecessary in a single-payer system.
6843| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""There would be no need for an individual mandate in a single-payer system, since everyone would be covered automatically and it would be paid for through their income and payroll taxes."
6844| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Mandates send stronger signal than automatic but voluntary enrollment.
6844| Health insurance mandates|premise|Mandates send the signal that health insurance is necessary in society, both for personal well-being and for the well-being of other taxpayers and members of society.
6845| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Automatic-enrollment is better alternative to insurance mandates.
6845| Health insurance mandates|premise|"""President Obama should propose using a mandate as the last resort, not the first."
6846| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Employers should be required to offer insurance to employees.
6846| Health insurance mandates|premise|"Leslie Dach, executive vice president of corporate affairs and government relations for Wal-Mart, said in July of 2009: ""At Wal-Mart, we believe in shared responsibility and support an employer mandate that is broad and fair."
6847| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Insurance mandates violate the rights of employers.
6847| Health insurance mandates|premise|Insurance mandates on employers violates the rights of employers to freely offer attractive packages to their employees and to engage in contracts generally.
6848| Health insurance mandates|conclusion|Insurance mandates should be placed on individuals if anything.
6848| Health insurance mandates|premise|Health insurance should no longer be associated with businesses.
6849| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed train stations can be positioned in city centers.
6849| High-speed rail|premise|While the travel time by plane itself cannot be beaten by currently known high-speed trains, the airports usually lie rather far from cities (due to the noise created by aircraft) and this increases the overall time needed for a trip.
6850| High-speed rail|conclusion|No need to turn off electronics, etc., on trains.
6850| High-speed rail|premise|"""High speed rail offers its riders the easiest, most comfortable way to travel."
6851| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail allows people to see/visit new places.
6851| High-speed rail|premise|"""I’ve talked to people who choose to go day trips to places they’ve never considered before after seeing them from a train window."
6852| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail helps relieve air-travel congestion.
6852| High-speed rail|premise|"""HIGH SPEED RAIL = FREEDOM! Freedom from the daily hassles, delays, dangers, and problems America's transportation systems have become."
6853| High-speed rail|conclusion|Rail travel has fewer weather related delays.
6853| High-speed rail|premise|Rail travel has less weather dependency than air travel.
6854| High-speed rail|conclusion|Airplanes better than high-speed trains for long distances.
6854| High-speed rail|premise|"""For long distances, the advantage of air travel over the train is obvious."
6855| High-speed rail|conclusion|Improving airport access better than new high-speed rail.
6855| High-speed rail|premise|If the problem with airports is that they are too hard to get to, then access should be improved, with public transit such as light rail systems extending to the airport.
6856| High-speed rail|conclusion|High speed rail cannot seriously displace air travel.
6856| High-speed rail|premise|"""HSR is promoted as something that can sort out nasty carbon-producing aircraft on domestic routes."
6857| High-speed rail|conclusion|Upgrading existing lines is ineffective solution.
6857| High-speed rail|premise|"""Opponents of the project have asked why we cannot simply upgrade our existing infrastructure to deal with this capacity challenge."
6858| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail has greater capacity than roads.
6858| High-speed rail|premise|Railroad tracks permit a far higher throughput of passengers per hour than a road the same width.
6859| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail offers freedom.
6859| High-speed rail|premise|"""HIGH SPEED RAIL = FREEDOM! Freedom from the daily hassles, delays, dangers, and problems America's transportation systems have become."
6860| High-speed rail|conclusion|Expanding roads and runways better than high-speed rail.
6860| High-speed rail|premise|"""The argument that not building this train system would mean building more highways and more runways doesn't hold water either."
6861| High-speed rail|conclusion|Train capacity can be increased without HSR.
6861| High-speed rail|premise|"""High-speed rail will indeed increase capacity, especially if it proceeds on German and French models and produces new lines across open countryside."
6862| High-speed rail|conclusion|Decentralized country planning better than high speed rail.
6862| High-speed rail|premise|"""We could even have a policy about developing strongly independent cities, such as those in Germany."
6863| High-speed rail|conclusion|High speed rail based on falsely seductive idea of speed.
6863| High-speed rail|premise|"""There is something quite seductive about speed."
6864| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed trains are highly sustainable and green.
6864| High-speed rail|premise|"""Trains are the most sustainable & green form of transportation."
6865| High-speed rail|conclusion|High speed rail efficiently increases capacity.
6865| High-speed rail|premise|"""True high speed rail (186+ mph) shortens trip times more than 70% over slower, conventional rail."
6866| High-speed rail|conclusion|More travel with high-speed rail is bad for environment.
6866| High-speed rail|premise|"""If we are serious about reducing our carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, we should not move towards higher speed, more carbon intensive forms of transport and a policy of increasing the mass of travel."
6867| High-speed rail|conclusion|Too few will ride HSR to have environmental impact.
6867| High-speed rail|premise|"""It won't relieve urban traffic congestion and its contribution to improving air quality (or reducing carbon dioxide emissions) will be negligible because it won't carry enough riders to make a big difference."
6868| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail creates many jobs.
6868| High-speed rail|premise|"""In the short term, it would create thousands of jobs planning, constructing and operating the line, as well as creating regeneration opportunities."
6869| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail fosters transit-oriented development.
6869| High-speed rail|premise|"""Transit oriented development (TOD) is the exciting new fast growing trend in creating vibrant, compact, livable, walkable communities centered around high quality train systems."
6870| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail helps businesspeople be more productive.
6870| High-speed rail|premise|"""High speed rail delivers fast, efficient transportation so riders can spend less time traveling and more time doing business."
6871| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail will get subsidies, but so do autos.
6871| High-speed rail|premise|"""automobiles and airplanes already get along with massive subsidies."
6872| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail can be funded by decreasing military spending.
6872| High-speed rail|premise|"""It seems to me that an 8."
6873| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail frees up existing rail for other purposes.
6873| High-speed rail|premise|"""High Speed Rail would also address the major rail capacity challenges that are set to arise over the next 20 years."
6874| High-speed rail|conclusion|High speed rail is a great tourist attraction.
6874| High-speed rail|premise|It is a fun ride to a big city destination.
6875| High-speed rail|conclusion|High speed rail reduces oil trade imbalance.
6875| High-speed rail|premise|It pays for itself by significantly reducing our $700 billion a year oil purchase trade deficit.
6876| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail is predominantly used by wealthy.
6876| High-speed rail|premise|"""Supporters of HSR talk about a total bill of £11bn from public funds."
6877| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail can't work without subsidies.
6877| High-speed rail|premise|"CATO's Tad DeHaven: ""As is the case with Amtrak, HSR can't compete with more efficient modes of transportation like automobiles and airplanes without massive subsidies."
6878| High-speed rail|conclusion|High speed rail not best way to create local jobs.
6878| High-speed rail|premise|"""If we really want to create jobs in all local economies, rather than drain them away along a very fast railway line, we could insulate 20m homes; make every house a mini-power station to generate and export its own electricity; sort out extremely poor quality commuter railway lines around all our cities; improve inter-regional rail links; and build 10,000 kms of segregated bike paths to connect every school, hospital, employment site and public building to every residential area."
6879| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail only works between close cities.
6879| High-speed rail|premise|"""Certain preconditions are necessary for corridor transit to work, and they don't exist in the U."
6880| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail is not a public good.
6880| High-speed rail|premise|"""the fact the biggest reason high-speed rail won't work in the U."
6881| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed transportation is really a private good.
6881| High-speed rail|premise|"""The problem, of course, is that high-speed rail in the U."
6883| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail safer than other forms of travel.
6883| High-speed rail|premise|From the point of view of required traffic control systems and infrastructure, high-speed rail has the added advantage of being much simpler to control due to its predictable course, even at very high passenger loads; this issue is becoming more relevant as air traffic reaches its safe limit in busy airspaces over London, New York, and other large centers.
6884| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail saves lives from car accidents.
6884| High-speed rail|premise|43,000 Americans die each year in car accidents.
6885| High-speed rail|conclusion|High-speed rail has greater risk of catastrophic accident.
6885| High-speed rail|premise|High speed rail, due to the extremely high speeds, is much more likely to result in a catastrophic accident in the event of some mistake and derailment.
6886| High-speed rail|conclusion|Unlike automobiles, rail fosters a sense of community.
6886| High-speed rail|premise|Trains bring people together to share in a trip.
6887| High-speed rail|conclusion|Cars/freeways better suited to independent spirit.
6887| High-speed rail|premise|"""Overall, in America we have much better road networks than most other countries and have developed over the years an independent spirit more suited to the car than the train."
6888| HIV status should be made public|conclusion|Many people disregard the risks to others.
6888| HIV status should be made public|premise|It should be made public as in many cases we have seen hiv+ person, despite knowing that he is infected, marrys, thus transmitting the disease to the spouse as well as future progeny.
6889| HIV status should be made public|conclusion|Violates Privacy of Responsible HIV+ People.
6889| HIV status should be made public|premise|Most people who know they have HIV will let their partners or at least use contraception, and some limit themselves to other people with the disease.
6890| HIV status should be made public|conclusion|Exposing HIV status is a good public warning system.
6890| HIV status should be made public|premise|With HIV being such a potent and stigmatised disease, people would regard this 'warning' seriously and it would deter people from having sex with HIV positive people.
6891| HIV status should be made public|conclusion|People are unlikely to check before having sex.
6891| HIV status should be made public|premise|When people are about to have sex, especially with someone they just met they are unlikely to think to check a database to make sure their partner doesn't have HIV.
6893| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Home plate collisions are essential tension of offense/defense.
6893| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Rounding the bases, getting to home plate and putting a run on the board for your team is what the game of baseball is all about."
6894| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|"Home base collisions are essential characteristic of ""hardball""."
6894| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Posey's injury isn't the first injury to result from a collision, and it likely won't be the last."
6895| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Runners throw themselves at fielder at second base as well.
6895| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""The argument has been made that at no other base does the runner launch his body at the fielder without trying to slide into the base first."
6896| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Home base collisions shouldn't be preserved for tradition's sake.
6896| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|Just because it's been around for a while does not make it right or necessarily worth preserving.
6897| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Home plate contact isn't an important part of game.
6897| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Contact isn’t an important part of the game like it is in football, and it isn’t necessary at the plate."
6898| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Home plate collisions turn baseball players into gladiators.
6898| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""I was a catcher in high school, and I was trained how to block the plate while trying to keep myself alive."
6899| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Home base collisions are exciting to watch.
6899| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""When they do occur, they’re exciting."
6900| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Pro baseball players are paid to take risks, entertain.
6900| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|Fosse told the San Francisco Chronicle.
6901| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|People shouldn't enjoy watching violent hits at home plate.
6901| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|Why is it that people seem to enjoy aggressive hits at home plate? If they do, it's probably for the wrong reasons.
6902| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|The game is worse off with good catchers injured.
6902| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""It’s in the best interest of the sport to keep the likes of Buster Posey and Carlos Santana healthy and on the field."
6903| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Being a catcher means accepting certain inherent risks.
6903| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Catchers are catchers because they are willing to be leaders and sacrifice their bodies."
6904| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Injuries are part of game, don't justify rule changes.
6904| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""No one likes to see people get hurt."
6905| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Catchers don't have to block the plate.
6905| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|They can swipe an incoming runner out just as effectively.
6906| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Home base collisions, injuries too rare to justify ban.
6906| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""These days, though, hard, smash-mouth collisions at the plate are rare birds, close to extinction."
6907| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|That catchers know risks doesn't mean risks can't be reduced.
6907| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Another argument is that Posey and all catchers understand the risk when they sign up to play catcher."
6908| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Catcher pads are not meant for human collisions.
6908| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""I also saw this argument, but I don’t think it was common."
6909| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Why subject pitchers to even more risks.
6909| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Major League catchers already endure enough wear and tear on their bodies as is."
6910| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Many collisions have caused career-changing injuries.
6910| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"Giants manager Bruce Bochy, a former catcher who had multiple head injuries in his playing days, called on Major League Baseball to explore ideas to protect players after the Buster Posey injury: ""I think we do need to consider changing the rules here a little bit because the catcher is so vulnerable and there's so many who have gotten hurt."
6911| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Runner can't just stop if catcher has ball.
6911| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"Ray Fosse, who was famously injured by Pete Rose in a home base collision, defended such collisions, arguing in 2011: ""The idea is to score runs."
6912| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Banning collisions would give unfair advantage to runner/catcher.
6912| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Collisions at home plate aren't always necessary, and should be occur sparingly, but to regulate them would inevitably hand either the baserunner or the catcher an unnecessary advantage in close-play situations."
6914| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Home plate collisions can be easily banned without changing game.
6914| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Just change the rules and make intentional contact with a catcher illegal, and make it illegal for catcher’s to impede the baserunner’s ability to run directly towards home plate."
6915| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Runners would easily adjust to slide into home plate.
6915| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""The next argument is what you would have the runner do instead."
6916| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Ending home plate collisions can be neutral for catcher, runner.
6916| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""Yes, it’s a dangerous play regardless, but those who would change the rules should change it in favor of the runner and the catcher."
6917| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Dangers are involved in every sport.
6917| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"Former All-Star catcher Bob Boone: ""It's in every sport that we have, there are dangers there."
6918| Home plate collision rule in baseball|conclusion|Other sports have changed rules to make game safer.
6918| Home plate collision rule in baseball|premise|"""changing rules about trying to score on fly balls would not fundamentally change the game."
6919| Home Schooling|conclusion|Parents are responsible for carrying out their children’s education.
6919| Home Schooling|premise|There is no logic that necessarily requires them to surrender that responsibility to the state.
6920| Home Schooling|conclusion|Homeschooling creates more educational opportunities.
6920| Home Schooling|premise|"""This state needs more educational options, not fewer, and an appeals court ruling in February definitely worked against this goal."
6921| Home Schooling|conclusion|Homeschooling jeopardizes a child's right to a good education.
6921| Home Schooling|premise|The most important thing in this debate is ensuring children receive the decent education which they have a right to - something that, with its resources, experience and expertise, the state is best placed to do.
6922| Home Schooling|conclusion|We should trust parents to know what is best for their children.
6922| Home Schooling|premise|parents care more, because it’s their child.
6923| Home Schooling|conclusion|It is wrong that home schooling will necessarily be of poor quality.
6923| Home Schooling|premise|Many parents will be fantastic teachers.
6924| Home Schooling|conclusion|State-provided education is far less likely to make mistakes than parents.
6924| Home Schooling|premise|Furthermore, the opportunity to keep children at home will be seized upon in large numbers by parents who resent the costs of schooling (e.
6925| Home Schooling|conclusion|Parents are less likely to be good teachers as professionals.
6925| Home Schooling|premise|The same applies to private tutors.
6927| Home Schooling|conclusion|Hundreds of researchers and experts ensure the quality of public schools.
6927| Home Schooling|premise|How presumptuous to think one might know better than that accumulated wisdom how to teach a child - as if that child being the product of an individual suddenly enhanced that individual’s knowledge of their educational needs beyond that of those that have given their lives to building an understanding of these complex matters, and are qualified through years of training to carry out the tasks we set them.
6931| Homosexuality|conclusion|Homosexuality is business of individual, should not be judged.

6941| Homosexuality|premise|"""Well, it will come as some surprise to a lot of heterosexuals to find out that, to a lot of gays, the thought of heterosexual sex is repulsive! But does that mean the discomfort of some gays to heterosexual couples should be a reason to deny heterosexuals the right to marry? I don't think so, even though the thought of a man kissing a woman is rather repulsive to many homosexuals! Well then, why should it work the other way? Besides, the same sexual practices that gays engage in are often engaged in by heterosexual couples anyway."

7215| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|conclusion|Immunity allows the politician to remain focused on serving his office effectively.
7215| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|premise|We have seen above how such a distraction might work.
7216| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|conclusion|Involvement in legal action does not damage the dignity of office.
7216| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|premise|First, there is the question of whether public office carries with it any inherent dignity other than that of its current bearer.
7217| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|conclusion|Immunity from prosecution would encourage cowardly politics.
7217| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|premise|By allowing politicians to take refuge behind immunity, the system encourages them not to censor themselves and so air their prejudices, half-baked ideas or unfounded allegations.
7218| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|conclusion|Immunity while in office encourages incumbents to try to hang onto office when it might be better for them to leave.
7218| Immunity from prosecution for politicians|premise|Where a politician knows that their immunity ends when they leaves office, they have an incentive to hang onto office for as long as possible and so avoid prosecution.

7263| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|premise|Climate aid is only necessary when the effects of climate change come to fruition in major ways.
7264| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|conclusion|Adaptation efforts may release even more greenhouse gases.
7264| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|premise|"""Because many of the proposals for adaptation to climate change require further extensive release of greenhouse gasses, they will only make climate change worse."

7267| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|premise|This is one of the great ironies of climate change: that while developed countries caused it, poor countries may suffer the most.
7269| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|conclusion|Responsibility of BRICs does not negate responsibility of Annex I.
7269| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|premise|Just because large developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China have more resources than other developing countries to combat climate change and adapt, does not mean that Annex I countries have any less of a responsibility to increase aid to developing countries for the purpose of adaptation.
7270| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|conclusion|Developed states did not know about warming.
7270| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|premise|Developed nations did not always know that they were causing global warming by burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
7271| Increase UN Annex I aid for climate change adaptation|conclusion|Climate change may benefit many poor countries.

7405| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Instant replays can be exciting for fans.
7405| Instant replay in baseball|premise|Examining instant replay in the stands or while watching TV can be exciting for fans as they get to see the play unfold in slow motion and the rules of the game unfold in detailed, fair, real-time analysis.
7406| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Machines shouldn't be determining calls in baseball.
7406| Instant replay in baseball|premise|"""Then there's the aesthetic argument, which is why—after athletes sweat and fight it out in a very human arena—should the contest be decided by some deus ex machina that just descends from above and declares, ""Beep! This is who won""? It's the same reason no one really cares about chess anymore; everyone knows the computer always wins."
7407| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Fallible umpire calls are part of the drama of baseball.
7407| Instant replay in baseball|premise|Many people actually enjoy the drama that comes with the fallibility of umpire's calls, and the importance placed on them making the right call, without the aid of instant replay.
7408| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Baseball lends itself well to instant replay.

7410| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Calls for instant replay rise with each bad call .
7410| Instant replay in baseball|premise|Every year in baseball, a number of serious bad calls are made that create a ground-swell of calls for the implementation of instant replay.

7414| Instant replay in baseball|premise|Events like Galarraga's perfect game are rare (although not that rare).
7415| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Enough controversial calls occur in baseball to justify replay.

7416| Instant replay in baseball|premise|"""none of us have ever witnessed a play that had such a major impact on history."
7417| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Not enough important bad calls occur to justify instant replay.
7417| Instant replay in baseball|premise|"""this call perfectly illustrates my point…that call ultimately did not affect the score of the game, the final outcome…and that has long been my stand against replay for umpires, plus to tie into that, I have not heard a plan yet that is rock solid for baseball."

7418| Instant replay in baseball|premise|"""An umpire is bound to miss at least a few of them."

7423| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Instant replay ends umpire shame of making decisive, bad calls.

7424| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Instant replay would reduce fights between coaches and umpires.
7424| Instant replay in baseball|premise|Bad calls are typically the reason for fights or shouting matches breaking out between coaches and umpires.

7425| Instant replay in baseball|premise|"""even with replay, sometimes we don't even really know the result."
7426| Instant replay in baseball|conclusion|Baseball should have a dedicated instant replay umpire.
7426| Instant replay in baseball|premise|"""there should be an extra umpire in a TV booth who communicates with the chief ump on the field."

7440| International Criminal Court|conclusion|The ICC is less effective due to US opposition.
7440| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The perceived U."
7441| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Deterrence theory untenable.
7441| International Criminal Court|premise|"""ICC will not help deter the danger of the ICC may lie in its potential weakness rather than its potential strength."
7442| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC is too ineffective to deter war crimes.
7442| International Criminal Court|premise|"""deterrence ultimately depends on perceived effectiveness, and the ICC fails badly on that point."
7443| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC is only a tool for protecting interests of powerful states.
7443| International Criminal Court|premise|The ICC like the UN security council will become only a tool for protecting the rights and deeds of a few countries.
7444| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC advances universal rights and international law.
7444| International Criminal Court|premise|Kofi Annan, Former U.
7445| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Crimes under ICC are already prohibited by international law.
7445| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Some ICC supporters have asserted that the crimes covered by the Rome Statute are already prohibited under international law either by treaty or under the concept of “universal jurisdiction” or both; therefore, all nations may assert jurisdiction to try persons for these crimes."
7446| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC courts uphold individual rights and due process.
7446| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Finally, there are some valid due process concerns relating to the operation of the Rome Statute."
7447| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC acts only if nat. courts can't.
7447| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Ultimately, should the US government or conservatives in general have any specific concerns about the due process or Constitutional protections (or lack thereof) afforded by the Rome Statute, the solution is simple: conduct an investigation or trial domestically so that there is no reason for the ICC to become involved."
7448| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC acts only if national courts cannot.
7448| International Criminal Court|premise|National courts have priority over ICC courts on all matters, including war crimes.
7449| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Without a constitution, ICC cannot adequately protect rights.
7449| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The ICC does not, and cannot, fit into a coherent, international structural ""constitutional"" design that delineates clearly how laws are made, adjudicated or enforced, subject to popular accountability and structured to protect liberty."
7450| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC can second-guess national prosecution terminations/denials.
7450| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Many U."
7451| International Criminal Court|conclusion|The ICC lacks democratic accountability to voters.
7451| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Never before has the United States been asked to place any of that power outside the complete control of our national government without our consent  In the ICC’s central structures, the Court and Prosecutor, these sorts of political checks are either greatly attenuated or entirely absent."
7452| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC authority impedes foreign policy flexibility.
7452| International Criminal Court|premise|"""ICC opponents, however, may point out that if individuals are charged for conduct related to carrying out official policy, the difference between asserting jurisdiction over individuals and over the nation itself becomes less clear."
7453| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC completes historic process starting with Nuremberg Trials.
7453| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The ICC, established in 2002, has a distinguished history."
7454| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC is not historically comparable to the Nuremberg tribunal.
7454| International Criminal Court|premise|"""It is common for proponents of the ICC to argue that it will function like a permanent Nuremberg tribunal."
7455| International Criminal Court|conclusion|UN Security Council can check/veto ICC prosecutions.
7455| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Administrative and budgetary controls are clearly defined."
7456| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Potential judicial mistakes don't justify opposing ICC.
7456| International Criminal Court|premise|"""In every democratic society it is unavoidable that some unjustified complaints may be lodged for political or other nefarious purposes."
7457| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC lacks separation of powers and checks and balances.
7457| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The American concept of separation of powers, imperfect though it is, reflects our settled belief that liberty is best protected when the various authorities legitimately exercised by government are, to the maximum extent possible, placed in separate branches."
7458| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC prosecutors are given too much power in deciding cases.
7458| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The independent prosecutor of the ICC has the power to issue indictments, subject to review only by a panel of three judges."
7459| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC advances principal universal jurisdiction on war crimes.
7459| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Universal jurisdiction is the principle that every country has an interest in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the most grave crimes, no matter where the crime was committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or their victims."
7460| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Universal Jurisdiction was never a legal principle.
7460| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The doctrine of universal jurisdiction asserts that some crimes are so heinous that their perpetrators should not escape justice by invoking doctrines of sovereign immunity or the sacrosanct nature of national frontiers  The very concept of universal jurisdiction is of recent vintage."
7461| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC brings order to a past of ad hoc tribunals.
7461| International Criminal Court|premise|"""it will have a much wider jurisdiction than existing ad hoc tribunals."
7462| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC has advanced provision for reparations and non-repetition.
7462| International Criminal Court|premise|"""the Statute of the ICC contains advanced provisions for the protection of victims from retraumatization, and the Court may order a convicted person to provide reparation, in the form of compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, satisfaction, guarantees of non-repetition and any other type of reparation the Court deems appropriate."
7463| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC will not have retroactive jurisdiction over past war crimes.
7463| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The ICC won't have retroactive effect, so it will only be able to try future criminals, and only after 60 countries have ratified it."
7464| International Criminal Court|conclusion|The ICC's authority is vague and over-reaching.
7464| International Criminal Court|premise|"""As to the former, the ICC’s authority is vague and excessively elastic, and the Court’s discretion ranges far beyond normal or acceptable judicial responsibilities, giving it broad and unacceptable powers of interpretation that are essentially political and legislative in nature."
7465| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC will continually expand jurisdiction over national sovereignty.
7465| International Criminal Court|premise|"""the court threatens to diminish America's sovereignty, produce arbitrary and highly politicized ""justice,"" and grow into a jurisdictional leviathan."
7466| International Criminal Court|conclusion|All UN members can vote on ICC definition of aggression.
7466| International Criminal Court|premise|"""ICC supporters may argue that all States Parties will have the opportunity to vote on a definition of aggression after the treaty has been in effect for seven years, which definition must comport with the U."
7467| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC adopts an unacceptably vague definition of aggression.
7467| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Numerous prospective ""crimes"" were suggested at Rome and commanded wide support from participating nations, such as the crime of ""aggression,"" which was included in the Statute, but not defined."
7468| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC has strong controls for politicization and abuse.
7468| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Henry Kissinger accuses the ICTY of allowing 'prosecutorial discretion without accountability' - ignoring all the controls that exist to prevent abuse."
7469| International Criminal Court|conclusion|The ICC risks heavy politicization of prosecution.
7469| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Another grave issue is the use in such cases of extradition procedures designed for ordinary criminals."
7470| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC helps protect captured servicemen abroad.
7470| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Kissinger's misperceptions about current international law lead him to the erroneous conclusion that if the U."
7471| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC can try servicemen only if domestic courts do not.
7471| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The possibility that American servicemen and women and political and military leaders could be held up to scrutiny for their actions is not a new one."
7472| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC puts national servicemen abroad at risk of prosecution.
7472| International Criminal Court|premise|President George W.
7473| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Article 98 agreements help protect US citizens from ICC.
7473| International Criminal Court|premise|"""As the ICC comes into being, we will address our concerns about the ICC’s jurisdictional claims using the remedy laid out for us by the Rome Statute itself and the UN Security Council in the case of the peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia."
7474| International Criminal Court|conclusion|US Article 98 does not seek to undermine the ICC.
7474| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The U."
7475| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC targets the worst war criminals, not global leaders.
7475| International Criminal Court|premise|"""In Washington many lost sight of the court’s aim to bring to justice political and military leaders who orchestrate massive atrocity crimes against thousands in lawless regions where national justice fails."
7476| International Criminal Court|conclusion|The innocent have nothing to fear from the ICC.
7476| International Criminal Court|premise|Countries such as the United States have avoided joining the ICC out of concern for protecting its leaders from prosecution.
7477| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC wrongly allows prosecution of legitimate leaders.
7477| International Criminal Court|premise|"""We are considering, in the Prosecutor, a powerful and necessary element of executive power, the power of law-enforcement."
7478| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Opposing ICC is not about protecting guilty, but sovereignty.
7478| International Criminal Court|premise|National governments that oppose the ICC, such as the United States, are not attempting to protect guilty nationals, but preserve their national sovereignty to try these individuals.
7479| International Criminal Court|conclusion|US opposition to ICC impairs action and justice in Sudan.
7479| International Criminal Court|premise|"""it is in Sudan that the incoherence of American policy toward the court has been most evident."
7480| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC war crime charges damaged diplomacy in Sudan.
7480| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC), has just made a mistake that will make it harder to help people suffering in Darfur."
7481| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Joining ICC will renew American leadership in international law.
7481| International Criminal Court|premise|"""I can think of no better place for President-elect Barack Obama to start in signaling a changed American approach to the world, and particularly its European allies, than the International Criminal Court."
7482| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Opposing ICC sends signal US doesn't care about War Crimes.
7482| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The absence of U."
7483| International Criminal Court|conclusion|The US cannot help reform the ICC unless it joins.
7483| International Criminal Court|premise|"Without ratifying the Rome Treaty, the US cannot participate in reforming and improving the ICC how the US sees fit, voting on such things as its definition of ""aggression""."
7484| International Criminal Court|conclusion|US double standard in trying only foreigners in ICC.
7484| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Other nations' delegations are aghast at what many frankly call the hypocrisy of the American position."
7485| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Double standard in War on Terror and US legal complaints to ICC.
7485| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The current U."
7486| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Opposition to ICC impaired US coalition-building for War on Terror.
7486| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The resistance of the U."
7487| International Criminal Court|conclusion|Bush opposed ICC to protect its actions in War in Iraq.
7487| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The Administration has told the American people that it refuses to participate in the ICC in order to protect our troops from being brought to the Hague."
7488| International Criminal Court|conclusion|ICC is very unlikely to prosecute US War in Iraq.
7488| International Criminal Court|premise|"""A recent determination by the ICC’s Chief Prosecutor seems to demonstrate a reluctance to launch an investigation against the United States based on allegations regarding its conduct in Iraq."
7489| International Criminal Court|conclusion|US is most likely to be targeted by ICC.
7489| International Criminal Court|premise|"""The ICC’s flaws may allow it to be used by some countries to bring trumped-up charges against American citizens, who, due to the prominent role played by the United States in world affairs, may have greater exposure to such charges than citizens of other nations."
7490| International Criminal Court|conclusion|US does not believe it is above the law in opposing ICC.
7490| International Criminal Court|premise|"""Why does the U."
7491| International Criminal Court|conclusion|US believes in international law and prosecuting War Criminals.
7491| International Criminal Court|premise|"""How can the United States oppose prosecuting war criminals?  We do not oppose prosecuting war criminals."
7497| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Intervention that is coordinated by the UN is destined to fail.
7497| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Many troops are under-supplied and lack basic military training.
7498| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Key international powers such as Russia and China would prevent the success of any mission undertaken.
7498| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Russia and China are hesitant if not outright opposed to sanctions against Sudan, let alone military action.
7499| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Military success in Darfur is doubtful.
7499| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|The military task in Darfur is substantial.
7500| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Military intervention in Darfur would worsen jihadi anti-Americanism.
7500| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|"""we should remember our experiences in Somalia and Iraq."
7501| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Sudan is a threat to African peace.
7501| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|By showing an obvious disregard for its own people, Sudan has hinted that it is unlikely to show regard for territorial recognition of its fellow African nations.
7502| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|History likens Sudan's actions to that of Hitler.
7502| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Precedence shows that countries that start with internal acts of terror are very likely to extend their terror beyond their borders.
7503| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Sudan is a threat beyond its own campaign of genocide.
7503| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Sudan has historically been linked to terrorists including Al Qaeda.
7504| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Darfur and the chaos there is a threat to the international system.
7504| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|There are a number of threats presented by Darfur, including regional and international humanitarian, moral threats.
7505| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Darfur is a threat to the region in Africa.
7505| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|The chaos in Darfur is spilling over Sudan's borders.
7506| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Impotency in responding to Darfur undermines confidence and engagement in international bodies.
7506| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Many instances of genocide have occurred in recent decades without international intervention, and this has weakened confidence in the UN and the international community's ability to respond to international crises and to generally act meaningfully in the international system.
7507| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|The Darfur crisis does not constitute a threat to international peace and security.
7507| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|The Darfur crisis is a domestic matter in Sudan, and is not spilling over dramatically or uncontrollably into the region.
7508| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|US and NATO humanitarian military interventions bring their own set of atrocities.
7508| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Noam Chomsky's The New Military Humanism , makes the case that NATO forces committed atrocities as bad or worse than the genocide that led to NATO's intervention in 1999.
7509| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Intervention might lead to more anti-Western sentiments.
7509| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Any UN or NATO intervention in Darfur would serve as a focus for anti-Western forces in the Horn of Africa and the African Sahel region, areas that are strategic to western interests and central to the war on terrorism.
7510| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|A Western intervention in Darfur would be followed by an Islamic extremist insurgency.
7510| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Osama bin Laden would rally Muslim extremists against a Western intervention in Darfur.
7511| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|A military intervention is unlikely from America.
7511| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|The United States is constrained in the War in Iraq and popular opinion is against any more wars considering the released criticisms on the debacles of intelligence in the pre-Iraq escalation.
7512| International military intervention in Darfur|conclusion|Preventing genocide in Darfur with US troops would take them away from preventing genocide in Iraq.
7512| International military intervention in Darfur|premise|Why favor one over the other? Since the United States is already military strained in Iraq, it is presumable that any commitment in Darfur would result in some weakening of resources for Iraq.
7521| Internet makes people closer|conclusion|Internet enables free dissemination of information.
7521| Internet makes people closer|premise|Internet (search engines especially - when not restricted) brought the possibility of easy dissemination of information, leading to improved awareness of the general public on all sort of matters.
7523| Internment|conclusion|"The war on terror is not truly winnable, making it wrong to ""intern"" or detain on the indefinite basis of such a war."
7523| Internment|premise|"there is no likely endpoint at which we will be able to declare an enemy to have been defeated and so allow detained ""enemy combatants"" to go home - so these harsh but supposedly temporary wartime measures will become the norm."
7524| Internment|conclusion|Depriving a person of their liberty without due process is wrong, unconstitutional, illegal, and unAmerican.
7524| Internment|premise|If we do not have strong evidence, we should not bring a person to trial.
7525| Internment|conclusion|Internment removes threats from society.
7525| Internment|premise|If clear threats exist to a society, a government is obligated to protect its citizens.
7526| Internment|conclusion|"Internet is used effectively by terrorists in propaganda and as a ""recruiting sergeant""."
7526| Internment|premise|Not only is intelligence often badly flawed, internment simply doesn't work as a strategy to combat terrorism.
7530| Internment|conclusion|At a time when our society is under threat, it is more important to protect our intelligence sources than it is to try and punish individual terrorists.
7530| Internment|premise|Even when strong proof exists, charging and trying terror suspects in open court would require governments to reveal their intelligence sources.
7533| Internment|conclusion|Although a normal public trial is not possible for security reasons, detainees' rights are still respected.
7533| Internment|premise|Safeguards are built into the internment process so that each case can be considered fairly, with the suspect represented before a proper tribunal and given a right to appeal to a higher authority.
7534| Internment|conclusion|Regardless of the procedures with which internment is dressed up by embarrassed authorities, it is open to abuse because trials are secret with the executive essentially scrutinising itself.
7534| Internment|premise|Often there is not a free choice of lawyer to represent the suspect (detainees before US Military Commissions can only choose lawyers approved by the executive).
7535| Internment|conclusion|Continued detention is sometimes elected by detainees over deportation, which makes it ok in these instances.
7535| Internment|premise|The measures taken by the UK government to detain foreign nationals identified by intelligence as a serious threat to Britain are justified by conflicting priorities.
7536| Internment|conclusion|Compromising our usual high standards of human rights encourages bad behaviour by other countries.
7536| Internment|premise|Governments with less concern for rights are reassured by the apparent failure of liberal democracy to address a terrorist threat, and feel justified in tightening up their own measures against individuals and groups perceived as a threat.

7833| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|The earth warmed significantly between 1910 and 1940 when emissions were not very high.
7833| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|How can we account for the warming of the Earth early in the century, from 1910 to 1940? At that time, the global emission of carbon dioxide from cars, trucks, and factories was relatively low--too low to account for the half-degree warming.
7834| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|The accelerating rate of global warming may be naturally caused.
7834| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|Some scientists note that global warming actually weakens the ability of the environment to absorb C02, thus making the planet even more susceptible to global warming.

7836| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|"While temperature changes ""lead"" CO2 historically, CO2 still caused added temperature change."
7836| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|It is probable that the sun-earth interactions did lead to increased temperatures historically that caused melting of ice and other effects that caused increased CO2 emissions.
7837| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|Humans have increased significantly the number of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, adding substantially to the greenhouse effect.
7837| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased substantially through the industrial revolution.
7838| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|"Water vapors do not have a ""forcing"" effect on climate change like human greenhouse gases."
7838| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|"While water is the most prominent greenhouse gas, it does not have a ""forcing"" effect on climate change."
7839| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|Global temperature variations have not been caused historically by C02.
7839| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|The historical record shows that temperature changes have actually preceded C02 changes.
7840| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|Humans are a small source of C02 emissions into the atmosphere.
7840| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|According to many sources, humans produce only single digit percentages of all the C02 that is released into the atmosphere every year.
7841| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|conclusion|Non-human water vapor is a primary driver of the greenhouse gas effect.
7841| Is climate change chiefly human-caused?|premise|Water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas.

7872| Is Islam compatible with democracy?|conclusion|Islamic states lack civil society where democratic debate and pressure can be fostered.
7872| Is Islam compatible with democracy?|premise|This is partly because a conservative and religious curriculum dominates education and discourages a culture of questioning and debate.
7873| Is Islam compatible with democracy?|conclusion|Civil Society is made up of a mixture of professional and student associations and indigenously Islamic organisations.

7877| Is Islam compatible with democracy?|conclusion|Islamic interpretations differ significantly over the role of women in Islamic society.
7877| Is Islam compatible with democracy?|premise|Some claim that the Qur’anic versus allowing polygyny makes this contingent on the equal treatment of wives, which being impossible, results in the prohibition of the practice.
7878| Is Islam compatible with democracy?|conclusion|Changes in other characteristics of the social structure have still been unable to loosen the grip of Islam on political consciousness.
7878| Is Islam compatible with democracy?|premise|In Egypt economic liberalization actually brought with it a de-liberalization of the state and the resurgence of Islamic ideals.

7901| Is Pluto a planet?|conclusion|"The new definition under the IAU will eliminate the possibility that dozens of new ""planets"", under the old definition, be found and that an unmanageable and less meaningful list of ""planets"" emerges."
7901| Is Pluto a planet?|premise|"""The Pluto-Charon system is too small and common in the outer solar system to be rightly categorized as a planet, and should be removed from the repertoire."
7902| Is Pluto a planet?|conclusion|Pluto's new status will diminish attention paid to dwarf planets.
7902| Is Pluto a planet?|premise|"A likely educational effect of the IAU definition stating that dwarf planets are not planets at all is the limitation of what is taught to elementary school children to only the eight ""major"" planets."

7991| Ivory trading|conclusion|Defining sentience is impossible, making it impossible to determine which animals deserve rights or protection.
7991| Ivory trading|premise|"Sentience refers to an animals ability to utilize their sensory organs in such a way that they can ""feel"" or ""perceive subjectively""."
7992| Ivory trading|conclusion|Even if we could define sentience, how human-like would an animal need to be to warrant protection.
7992| Ivory trading|premise|The problem with protecting animals on the basis of their sentience or their human-likeness is that it is nearly impossible to define a threshold for legal purposes.
7993| Ivory trading|conclusion|Elephants are sentient beings, and are too similar to humans to be subject to killing.
7993| Ivory trading|premise|Some research indicates that elephants are  that should not be subject to killing.
7994| Ivory trading|conclusion|An ivory trading ban actually encourages illegal trading by raising the price of ivory.
7994| Ivory trading|premise|A trading ban does not choke off demand for the ivory, but instead raises the price to exorbitant levels, encouraging poaching.
7995| Ivory trading|conclusion|The 1986 ban has reduced demand for ivory.
7995| Ivory trading|premise|At present demand for ivory is low and shrinking, and prices are actually lower than before 1989.
7996| Ivory trading|conclusion|Elephant populations have revived, making it possible to lift the ban.
7996| Ivory trading|premise|The elephant populations of southern African states are growing rapidly, placing a strain upon the resources of the national parks in which they live.
7997| Ivory trading|conclusion|Increases in elephant populations are only occurring in some places, making the UN ban on ivory trading still relevant.
7997| Ivory trading|premise|Although elephant populations in southern Africa are viable and increasing, this is not the case elsewhere in Africa, nor is it true of the wild Asian elephant populations of South Asia.
7998| Ivory trading|conclusion|Governments should be able to sell the ivory they confiscate in order to fund their expensive regulation of ivory trading.
7998| Ivory trading|premise|Ivory is expensive to obtain (through culls or monitoring of very elderly beasts) and store, and degrades over time.
7999| Ivory trading|conclusion|The experimental export of raw ivory in 1999 from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe  was successful in all respects.

8014| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Moving Kangaroos resolves issue of habitat and species destruction.
8014| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The main justification for the culling of Kangaroos is that they are overpopulating specific areas, which strains the ecosystem of that area and kills species residing there.
8015| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Culling Kangaroo will reduce their consumption of Australian crops.
8015| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Kangaroos are breeding quickly and faster than they are dying.
8016| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo destruction of habitats is causing soil erosion that damages crops.
8016| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Soil erosion in the areas where Kangaroos are grazing leads to problems on farms.
8017| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos are not terrorizing wheat crops.
8017| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"""Other justifications for the kill are that kangaroos are pests who destroy wheat crops and compete with livestock for grazing."
8018| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Moving Kangaroos would address crop destructions in specific areas.
8018| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|If Kangaroos are eating crops in specific areas, why not move them to other habitats that are capable of housing them and that are not near crops? This is an adequate solution to crop destructions, and avoids the less humane action of culling them.
8020| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos are the cause of costly car accidents.
8020| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"Kangaroos : ""These kangaroos have no experience of roads."
8021| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos destroy habitats, causing soil erosion, water contamination.
8021| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|By eating grass and destroying habitats, Kangaroo strip the land of its capacity to hold together, which leads to soil erosion.
8022| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo shootings can jeopardize public safety.
8022| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Kangaroo culling typically take the form of rifle shootings of Kangaroos.
8023| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|A Kangaroo culling would humanely prevent a population crash.

8024| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|The RSPCA's support for a culling hints that it is in the long-term interests of Kangaroos.
8024| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The RSPCA is the Royal Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals.
8025| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|The meat and skin of culled Kangaroos will not be wasted.
8025| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The meat would be utilized for human consumption and pet food, and the pelts for soft toys and other items.
8026| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo shooting may be preferable to culling by dart-euthanasia.
8026| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"""Darting followed by lethal injection sounds simple and humane, and is probably a good option for small numbers of animals."
8027| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos are killed for commercial purposes without complaint.
8027| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|It is peculiar that protesters are so vehemently opposed to government-run culls when commercial mass-killings have been occurring for years on a much grander scale.
8028| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|The Code of Practice in the ACT helps ensures culls are humane.
8028| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|This is a set of government guidelines that regulates such things as the accuracy of sharpshooters that kill Kangaroos, ensuring that direct shots to the head occur and result in the instantaneous, painless death of Kangaroos.
8029| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Cullings of any kind are cruel to animals.
8029| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Murder is cruel, always.
8030| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Culling kangaroos is inhumane when humane alternatives exist.
8030| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|There seem to be good alternatives to a culling that would be a more humane alternative to a culling.
8031| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Commercial use of kangaroo meat and leather is unethical.
8031| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The sale of Australian-Kangaroo Adidas shoes was actually banned in California, USA for 37 years, as well as some other places around the world.
8032| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos can be culled humanely through sedation then euthanasia.
8032| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Cullings can involve dart sedation first, and then euthanasia with lethal injection.
8033| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo culling by dart-euthanasia can be inhumane.
8033| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Kangaroo culling by darts for sedation and then with poison to euthanize Kangaroos can actually lead to severe distress, pain, and suffering among individual Kangaroos and groups of Kangaroos.
8034| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Translocating Kangaroos in Australia often traumatizes these animals.
8034| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"The New York Times reported on March 14th, 2008, ""The Australian Capital Territory government said its commissioner for sustainability and the environment had considered moving the animals but concluded it would traumatize them."
8035| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Translocation of Kangaroos threatens integrity of their new habitat.
8035| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Introducing any new population into an environment always entails risks to that environment.
8036| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Translocation often places Kangaroos in a threatening environment.
8036| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Translocation often thrust Kangaroos into a new environment in which new predators exist and in which the vegetation and diet is unfamiliar to them.
8037| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Moving massive numbers of Kangaroos is an expensive project.
8037| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Herding Kangaroo herds into trucks is not easy, particularly when it involves thousands of Kangaroos.
8038| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos should just be moved, not culled.
8038| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The main justification for the culling of Kangaroos is that they are overpopulating specific areas, which strains the ecosystem of that area or simply concentrates difficulties for local human populations.
8039| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Translocating Kangaroos is not too difficult or impractical.
8039| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Given the size of Australia and range of wildlife and habitats to choose from, translocation can be achieved relatively easily.
8040| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Sterilization is not an effective response to Kangaroo over-population.
8040| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"""Sterilisation has also been suggested, and that is worth considering proactively, when a population is small, in order to head off the problem before it arises."
8041| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Sterilization vaccines can be used instead of killing Kangaroos.
8041| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"""Defence is implementing an experimental form of fertility control at the fenced Belconnen Naval Transmitter Station, based on research by a partnership involving the University of Newcastle and ACT Parks, Conservation and Lands."
8042| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Artificially feeding Kangaroos does not typically slow habitat destruction.
8042| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The reason for this is that Kangaroos, if given more to eat, are likely to expand in population-size, which results in greater resource strains on a habitat and can even result in the need for a larger cull.
8043| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Australia has the worst wildlife record in the world.
8043| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Artifically feeding a signature animal of Australia only adds to Australia's poor track record.
8044| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Australia's connection with the Kangaroo will not be weakened by a modest culling.
8044| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The proposal is not to eradicate Kangaroo populations.
8045| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|National symbols are not as important as national interests of sustainable Kangaroo populations.
8045| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|While national symbols have value, they are not absolutes.
8046| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos are part of Australia's identity.
8046| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|In Australia, the kangaroo is part of their identity.
8047| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Culling Kangaroo tarnishes the image of Australia around the world.
8047| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|The international response to the proposal to cull Kangaroo populations in Australia has been met by significant international revulsion.
8048| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Killing millions of kangaroos does not make it sustainable.
8048| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Australia is a very very big continent and kangaroos cannot become in plague porportions.
8049| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo cullings will not be substantial enough to damage the tourism industry.
8049| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Kangaroo cullings would not so massively diminish Kangaroo populations that there would be too few kangaroos for tourists to view.
8050| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo culling damages the tourism industry.
8050| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Tourists come to Australia, in large part, to see the Kangaroos there.
8051| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Australia could make alot more money on Kangaroo tourism.
8051| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|If Australia was to stop killing them and built up a magnificent kangaroo tourism program, Australia could instead make $600 million per annum on roo tourism.
8052| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo culling to fight overpopulation cannot be compared with whaling.
8052| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Japan and other whalers are typically killing a scarce population of whales, that has only recently emerged from the threatened species status.
8053| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroo culling undermines Australia's case against Japanese whaling.
8053| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"""JAPAN is using the slaughter of hundreds of eastern grey kangaroos in Canberra to undermine Australia's anti-whaling crusade."
8054| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|In this case, the aboriginal interest must be placed on the back burner.
8054| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|"""Farmers have a very different view."
8055| Kangaroo culling in Australia|conclusion|Kangaroos have been part of Aboriginal culture for millenia.
8055| Kangaroo culling in Australia|premise|Kangaroos are native to Ausralia and special to Aborigines.

8061| Kosovo independence|premise|"that, ""Kosovo has nowhere left to go other than independence."
8062| Kosovo independence|conclusion|An independent Kosovo would actually become part of the EU.
8062| Kosovo independence|premise|"Kosovo does not intend to ""go it alone"" as an independent nation, but, rather, to join with the EU."
8063| Kosovo independence|conclusion|Kosovo is too underdeveloped for independence.
8063| Kosovo independence|premise|Serbs do not enjoy freedom of movement, there is little decentralized power-sharing with local communities, political and legal institutions have yet to mature, political infighting is rampant, crime and corruption are high, patronage systems are deeply embedded in the clannish structure of Albanian society, poverty and economic woes persist, and all of this undermines Kosovo's efforts to attract foreign capital.
8064| Kosovo independence|conclusion|An independent Kosovo would be financially costly to its neighbors.
8064| Kosovo independence|premise|"""Kosovo might be of similar fate  simply because the proponents of Albanian nationalism want to grant it independence yet it is unclear whether they are also willing to pay an exorbitant tribute to the Kosovo Alabanian government whose taxable base of less then 2 million people earning average of $30 per month cannot yield not 1% of required costs to run that country."
8065| Kosovo independence|conclusion|An independent Kosovo would have to pay impossible debts to Serbia.
8065| Kosovo independence|premise|The Kosovo region owes Serbia a significant amount of money for what the country has invested in Kosovo over the years.
8066| Kosovo independence|conclusion|Northern Kosovo serbs may secede from an independent Kosovo.
8066| Kosovo independence|premise|North of the Ibar river, Kosovo's serbs are largely opposed to an independent Kosovo and have threatened that they would secede.
8086| Kosovo independence|conclusion|Support for Kosovo independence will reduce Muslim resentment.
8086| Kosovo independence|premise|It should be noted that Kosovo's Albanian population is chiefly Muslim, as opposed to the Christian orthodoxy of Serbia.
8087| Kosovo independence|conclusion|Kosovo independence would encourage other separatist movements.
8087| Kosovo independence|premise|Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia, Romania, and Spain have all resisted Kosovo independence out of concern that it would encourage separatist movements in their own territories.

8093| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Fighting climate change means cutting emissions with Kyoto Protocol.
8093| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Fighting global warming requires that countries move from a path of higher and higher greenhouse gas emissions each year to decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions.
8094| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|The Kyoto Protocol's target cuts in emissions are achievable.
8094| Kyoto Protocol|premise|BROOKLIN, Canada, Nov 21 (IPS) - Total greenhouse gas emissions of 40 industrialised countries rose to a near all-time high in 2005, but the Kyoto Protocol will still exceed its reduction targets, a United Nations agency said two weeks before political leaders meet in Bali, Indonesia to begin negotiations on a new and more aggressive treaty to battle climate change.
8095| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto Protocol initiates cooperation on climate.
8095| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Stanford University climate scientist Stephen H.
8096| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|General statements of support for the Kyoto Protocol.
8096| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Reijo Kemppinen, a spokesman for the European Commission, said about Russia's ratification of Kyoto in September of 2004.
8097| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto makes insufficient emission cuts to fight global warming.
8097| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""1."
8098| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|The Kyoto Protocol is showing little progress in reducing emissions.
8098| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""The Kyoto Protocol is a symbolically important expression of governments' concern about climate change."
8099| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto is too difficult to implement.
8099| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""2."
8100| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|The Kyoto protocol cannot significantly cut emissions without the US.
8100| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"Lord May, former Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government between 1995 and 2000, said in 2005, ""The Royal Society has calculated that the 13 per cent rise in greenhouse gas emissions from the United States between 1990 and 2002 is already bigger than the overall cut achieved if all the other parties to the Protocol reach their targets."
8101| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto Protocol is important symbol in climate fight.
8101| Kyoto Protocol|premise|The Kyoto Protocol is the most important international environmental and global warming treaty ever created.
8102| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto protocol is too costly a symbol.
8102| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""even as the champagne corks popped, Kyoto’s apologists were quietly admitting that the treaty would not prevent global warming, stating its importance was largely ‘‘symbolic."
8105| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Global warming is chiefly human-caused, making Kyoto important.
8105| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Global warming has spiked significantly since the industrial revolution, indicating that, despite some possible natural causes of global warming, it is chiefly caused by human green-house gas emissions.
8106| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Even if humans play a smaller role in climate change, Kyoto is still good.
8106| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"Even if humans are not actually the ""chief"" cause of global warming, there is little dispute that we play some role, due to our emissions of greenhouse gases, which contribute to the warming of the globe."
8107| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto is justified if global warming is merely considered probable.
8107| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""The scientific evidence for global warming is reviewed every five years and we are becoming increasingly convinced that it is caused by human activity."
8108| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto Protocol is important beyond fighting global warming.
8108| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Reducing carbon emissions is important on many levels, not just on the grounds of fighting global warming.
8109| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Humans are not causing global warming so Kyoto can't solve it.
8109| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Natural causes are principally responsible for global warming today, making Kyoto irrelevant.
8110| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto would only benefit the global warming establishment.
8110| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"Professor Kirill Kondratyev, Russian Academy of Sciences - ""The only people who would be hurt by abandoning the Kyoto Protocol would be several thousand people who make a living attending conferences on global warming."
8111| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto doesn't avert crisis.
8111| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""advancing climate science could convince the public that human-induced climate change is a minor contributor to the much larger natural changes and that, in any case, a slightly warmer climate and higher carbon dioxide levels would benefit agricultural crops and all of humanity."
8112| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Industrial countries caused global warming so should carry burden.
8112| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""There are some who will try to pervert this precedent and use xenophobia or nativist arguments to say that every country should be held to the same standard."
8113| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|India/China can be pressured into joining Kyoto or other treaties.
8113| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Ralph Nader, attorney, author, and political activist, stated in a Mar.
8114| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|China is actually taking good measures to fight global warming.
8114| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""China has worked hard to adjust its economic structure to improve energy saving and cut emissions."
8115| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto Protocol wrongly exempts large developing nations.
8115| Kyoto Protocol|premise|If the developing world's emissions are not contained by the Kyoto Protocol, then the efforts of developed countries are rendered meaningless.
8116| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto regulations on developed nations hurts developing nations.
8116| Kyoto Protocol|premise|Hans Martin Seip and Sigbjørn Grønås.
8117| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|The Kyoto Protocol's emissions targets are economically reasonable.
8117| Kyoto Protocol|premise|A large part of this argument is empirical.
8118| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|The Kyoto Protocol stimulates new industries.
8118| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""ECO-lobbyists emitted tonnes of greenhouse gases this week as carbonated wine corks popped following the victory of the 'lower-emission' Labor Party."
8119| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Kyoto does not require we choose between environment and economy.
8119| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"Joseph Biden wrote in a 2001 letter to President Bush - ""It's a false choice to say we need to favor the economy over the environment."
8120| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Costs of Kyoto are less than environmental-economic costs of inaction.
8120| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""When we burn it in fuel, and then breathe it in, we are literally poisoning ourselves."
8121| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Opponents of Kyoto are pandering to the energy industry.
8121| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"Laurie David, Natural Resources Defense Council - ""As the world celebrates the global warming pact's debut, Bush continues to pander to the energy industry."
8122| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|Government can cut-back on military spending to pay for Kyoto.
8122| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"""It seems reasonable to expect the world's leading economies and emitters to devote as much money to this challenge as they currently spend on military research -- in the case of the United States about $80 billion a year."
8123| Kyoto Protocol|conclusion|The Kyoto Protocol entails serious economic costs for signatories.
8123| Kyoto Protocol|premise|"Andrei Illarionov, Putin's economic minister - ""The Kyoto Protocol is a death pact, however strange it may sound, because its main aim is to strangle economic growth and economic activity in countries that accept the protocol's requirements."

8288| Legacy admissions|conclusion|The legacy system encourages families to donate money.
8288| Legacy admissions|premise|Having students enrolled due to legacy, pushes families to give money to the universities.
8289| Legacy admissions|conclusion|Legacy preferences do not increase universities' revenues.
8289| Legacy admissions|premise|The universities justify it saying that they result in increased alumni donations, which is not legally cognizable.
8290| Legacy admissions|conclusion|Legacy preferences do not influence the universities' fund raising.
8290| Legacy admissions|premise|By analyzing fund raising rates at colleges with and without legacy admissions, there has been concluded that there has been no diminished giving at colleges that dropped legacy admissions.
8306| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|Coca chewing and use are inviolable Andean traditions.
8306| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|"""The custom of chewing coca leaves has existed in the Andean region of South America since at least 3000 B."

8310| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|Coca chewing far pre-dates cocaine use.
8311| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|Coca chewing in the Andes is like coffee in the West.
8311| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|Coca is an essential stimulant in daily life in the Andes, just as coffee is in the West.
8312| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|Coca chewing for cultural, not medical, reasons is unjust.
8312| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|Latvia opposed Bolivia's 2011 proposed amendment to the UN's narcotics treaty with the following language: that because the purpose of Bolivia’s amendment is “to maintain a habit and socio-cultural practice, not a medical or scientific purpose,” coca leaf chewing still needs to be abolished.
8313| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|Tradition of coca consumption is a poor argument.
8313| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|Continuing a tradition is always a weak argument in defense of a policy.
8314| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|Coca is culturally popular due to broad cocaine production.
8314| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|"""While it is true that coca and cocaine are not the same, without cocaine coca would never have occupied such an important place in Andean culture."
8315| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|Coca yes, cocaine no is a workable policy.

8316| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|If coca legal, farmers will change from illegal cocaine.
8316| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|If legalized, farmers will shift their production of coca from cocaine-purposed coca to open market coca production.

8322| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|"The Vienna-based UN International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) said exceptions for Bolivia would undermine international narcotics control efforts: ""Allowing coca would undermine the integrity of the global drug control system, undoing the good work of governments over many years."

8329| Legality of coca production and consumption|conclusion|Balloon effect occurs because some are weak on eradication.
8329| Legality of coca production and consumption|premise|The balloon effect often occurs simply due to inconsistent eradication policies in South America; while one country like Columbia is strong on eradication, other countries like Peru and Bolivia grow soft and even legalize or decriminalize the growth and chewing of coca.

8334| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest has same potential for power-abuse as other relationships.
8334| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Banning incest because of the potential for the abuse of power in family relationships is wrong-headed.
8335| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest law should not be framed by bad-apple scenarios.
8335| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The case against incestuous couples relies too much on speculation about worst-case scenarios in which poor judgment and corrupt morals lead to abuse in the relationship.
8336| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Consensual adult incest should not be confused with abusive incest.
8336| Legalization of adult incest|premise|It is easy to confuse adult incest with abusive forms of incest; such as intragenerational incest between a father an his 14 year-old daughter.
8337| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest frequently involves abuse of power in family relationships.
8337| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Many sibling relationships involve considerable power.
8338| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legalization of incest would encourage patriarchal abuse.
8338| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""The mothers of incest survivors described a 'world of the father', a world that extended from the private domain of the family to the larger, public, societal domain."
8339| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legalizing incest increases the risks of abuse.
8339| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Those most likely to take up the ‘opportunities’ offered by this change in the law live in remote, isolated places where abuse is even more likely to be successfully concealed.
8340| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Consenting adults have a right to engage in incest.
8340| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"Incestuous defendants in a 2007 case in Cincinnati, USA wrote: ""Our view of Lawrence is a fairly narrow one, that there is a Constitutional right under the 14th Amendment's due process clause that says private consensual activity between adults cannot be criminal."
8341| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|State has no role in private sexual affairs such as incest.
8341| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The individual and family should generally have the ability to choose its own course.
8342| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Adults taught incest as children cannot fully consent.
8342| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Kissing and cuddling (in a different context, the natural displays of familial affection) can be used over years on an underage person to ensure that their view of sexuality is firmly based on a sexualised family environment and to ensure that, by the time they do come ‘of age,’ that they are firmly on the path to commit incest.
8343| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Consenting adults have no right to engage in harmful incest.
8343| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Consent is not the only criteria for the legality of actions.
8344| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest is taboo without a clear rationale as to why.
8344| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Incest has been bashed for centuries by society.
8345| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|"Incest must be harmful not just ""immoral"" to be banned."
8345| Legalization of adult incest|premise|There are many things that are immoral that are still legal.
8346| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|"Citizens must tolerate ""immorality"" such as incest."
8346| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The case against incest is based on an application of biblical rules that have little to do with today’s inclusive and tolerant principles.
8347| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incestuous couples have a right to follow their own morals.
8347| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The state and society should not engage itself too deeply in setting moral standards for other citizens.
8348| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest is actually not universally abhorred.
8348| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""It's universally condemned -- this was also used against interracial marriage etc."
8349| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Magnitude of moral abhorrence of incest justifies ban.
8349| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The case against incest is certainly not merely biblical, but it exists in almost all religions for the very sound reason that it it undermines so many fundamental values and morals in society: the integrity of the family institution, the integrity of the institution of marriage, the safety of children from abuse and molestation, the health of offspring, among other tangible and moral damages discussed below.
8350| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Inbreeding is immorally bad for society over time.
8350| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The children of incestuous parents are much more likely to see incest as acceptable and to, therefore, engage in incest themselves.
8351| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Evolutionary emotions against incest don't make it immoral.
8351| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""the natural aversion to incest among most human beings is so strong that we formulate moral and legal norms against incest and enforce them as expressions of our natural emotional dispositions  We can see how reason comes into play here."
8352| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|"That incest is ""unnatural"" does not make it immoral."
8352| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""It's unnatural -- the same old line's been used to prove the immorality of homosexuality, interracial marriage, contraception etc."
8353| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest is found in the animal kingdom, so is natural.
8353| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Incest is fairly common in the animal kingdom.
8354| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|We all descend from common relatives, so all sex is incest.
8354| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""On another note, incest is only a matter of degree."
8355| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest wrongly impairs natural human evolutionary progress.
8355| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Incest is against the natural order of things.
8356| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest taboo is due to evolutionary inclination for variation.
8356| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Charles Darwin has a chapter ""On the Good Effects of Crossing, and On the Evil Effects of Inbreeding."
8357| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Many things are bad for the family, but not banned like incest.
8357| Legalization of adult incest|premise|David Archard.
8358| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Adult incest can occur after family years.
8358| Legalization of adult incest|premise|David Archard.
8359| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest does not affect other families.
8359| Legalization of adult incest|premise|It is absurd to suggest that the existence of incestuous couples undermines the wider family model.
8360| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Marriage is a contract with little sanctity for incest to violate.
8360| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Marriage is treated only as a cut-and-dry contract under the law.
8361| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest ban is inappropriate tool.
8361| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""the anthropological rationale put forward most famously by Professor Claude Lévi-Strauss — that incest prohibitions are a necessary mechanism for building society by forcing people to create alliances outside of narrow family groups — seems entirely inadequate as a reason to prohibit consensual relationships in a modern world whose social integration is not plausibly threatened by the few people who might choose to align themselves with family members."
8362| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Confusing laws for married incestuous couples show flaws of ban.
8362| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"In some cases where incestuous couples get married, they are afforded protections due to their ""marital status"", without which they would be convicted of the ""crime"" of incest."
8363| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest undermines the family and its nurturing relationships.
8363| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 incest case: ""The state has a legitimate interest in prohibiting incestuous relations and in protecting the family unit and family relationships."
8364| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest laws enable appropriate family intimacy without suspicion.
8364| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Incest bans allow children and family members to interact in ordinary and intimate ways (ie, sitting on laps, hugging, kissing on the cheeck) without raising undue suspicions or concerns.
8365| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|The state often intervenes in family affairs.
8365| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The idea that family life is totally private is wrong: the government intervenes frequently in family life when there is a compelling interest to do so: when parents take drugs or neglect or abuse their children, or when people are violent.
8366| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest can seclude people within their family network.
8366| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Professor Claude Lévi-Strauss argues that an incest prohibition is a necessary mechanism for building society by forcing people to form alliances outside of narrow family groups.
8367| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Risks for children of incest are tolerably low.
8367| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The risks involved in blood relatives having children are vastly overstated, normally by people that oppose incest for spurious “moral” reasons.
8368| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Hereditary risk of incest are same as some other couples.
8368| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""The rationale based on genetics is also suspect under current law: even setting aside nonprocreative intimate relationships, in no other legal realm does the government criminally prohibit two people from having children because their offspring are more likely to inherit genetic defects."
8369| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|"Genetic screening undermines ""risk"" argument against incest."
8369| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""More generally, scientific advances that enable doctors to screen for many potentially harmful genes may render general presumptions about genetic risks, like those embodied in marriage bans, inappropriate."
8370| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest is not easily determined as cause of defect.
8370| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Conclusively determining, beyond a reasonable doubt, that incest is the cause of a specific defect in the child of an incestuous couple is very difficult.
8371| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incestuous relationships could be legal, but ban reproduction.
8371| Legalization of adult incest|premise|This argument is a possible compromise, which allows for the legalization of consensual adult incest generally, but a ban on incestuous reproduction.
8372| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Children of incest are at greater risk of disorders.
8372| Legalization of adult incest|premise|It is well known that the risks involved in blood relatives procreating are enormous.
8373| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Inbreeding is increasingly risky and unsustainable over time.
8373| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The children of incestuous parents are much more likely to see incest as acceptable and to, therefore, engage in incest themselves.
8374| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest is more dangerous than other at-risk reproduction.
8374| Legalization of adult incest|premise|It is true that risks are run by other reproducing couples in society.
8375| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legal incest would add risks on top of other risky mating.
8375| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The existence of other couples that run genetic risks is an argument against legalizing incestuous relationships: the medical system already has enough trouble dealing with the offspring created by couples with conditions society doesn’t condemn.
8376| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Children of incest are a greater burden on society/taxpayers.
8376| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Because the children of incest couples are more likely to suffer from illness and deformity, they are more likely to become a burden on the health system and thus the taxpayers of a society.
8377| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest offspring suffer from social/moral rejection.
8377| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The offspring of incest often suffer from widespread rejection or mistreatment in society.
8378| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest offspring suffer from confusion about their identity.
8378| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The offspring of incestuous couples have a difficult time understanding and identifying with their ancestry.
8379| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legality of incest cannot rely on whether couples reproduce.
8379| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Incestuous couples often do not have any children.
8380| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Sex is for pleasure as much as reproduction.
8380| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Humans very rarely have sex for the purpose of procreation.
8381| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Sex is for reproduction.
8381| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Sexual intercourse is done to produce children and not simply to get your rocks off.
8382| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incestuous couples love one another the same as other couples.
8382| Legalization of adult incest|premise|You can’t help with whom you fall in love.
8383| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|"Sense of immorality undermines the ""love"" between incest couples."
8383| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"Incestuous couples often report, ""I feel that I am in love with my sister, but I know that I am doing something wrong""."
8384| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legalization would not increase incest.
8384| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"Joachim Renzikowski, a criminal law professor at Germany's Halle University, quoted in a 2007 BBC article - ""I doubt equally that getting rid of our incest law will result in any measurable increase in cases."
8385| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legalization would approve incest and increase it.
8385| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Legalizing incest does more than acknowledge it – it legitimises it with a mark of state approval.
8386| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incest cannot be successfully banned.
8386| Legalization of adult incest|premise|It is impossible to effectively ban incest.
8387| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Sending law-abiding incestuous couples to prison looks bad.
8387| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Most incestuous couples are just like other people, abide by all laws, pay their taxes, and perform good deeds.
8388| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Difficult enforcement is no cause for legalizing incest.
8388| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The law should not consider the expediency of enforcement.
8389| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incestuous minority deserves protections.
8389| Legalization of adult incest|premise|It is true that very few people are affected by an incest ban, but minorities deserve protection just like everyone else, and often need it more.
8390| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legal incest affords existing couples better treatment/aid.
8390| Legalization of adult incest|premise|It is foolish to suggest that incest does not occur already.
8391| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Inbreeding is unsustainable for society, so is bad law.
8391| Legalization of adult incest|premise|The children of incestuous parents are much more likely to see incest as acceptable and to, therefore, engage in incest themselves.
8392| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Outlawing incest opens slippery slope to other prohibitions.
8392| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""the slippery slope argument cuts both ways: Forbidding the brother-sister love might yield future amendments in legislation that are more than questionable from a moral point of view – particularly because, as outlined above, a legislation consistent as regards the aspect of protection from hereditary diseases has to forbid a lot of relationships and thus get into conflict with the right to self determination."
8393| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legal incest opens slippery slope to legalizing other behavior.
8393| Legalization of adult incest|premise|If the proposition are right, and there is fundamentally nothing wrong with incestuous relationships, and that many involving those over the age of consent contain true consensual love between two people, then why exclude the possibility of father/daughter, mother/son, father/son, bestiality, and polygamous relationships? If all the principles they espouse are right, wouldn't forbidding these other relationships be arbitrary, unequal treatment, and discriminatory? Once you open the gate to incest, many other gates will have to be opened as well.
8394| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Bible supports incest and embraces its practice.
8394| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""And Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living."
8395| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Religion should have no role in incest law.
8395| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""Religion also does not provide a viable rationale for incest prohibitions."
8396| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Bible condemns incest, supports its moral condemnation.
8396| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations."
8397| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Religion's impact on morals must be considered in incest ban.
8397| Legalization of adult incest|premise|While it is true that there is a separation between church and state and that religion cannot play a direct role in the law on incest, this does not mean that it cannot be weighed for its significance in creating the moral foundations of modern society.
8398| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Banning adult incest is analogous to banning homosexuality.
8398| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"Once, we condemned homosexuality as ""unnatural"" and ""immoral""."
8399| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Legal gay marriage sets precedent for incest marriage.
8399| Legalization of adult incest|premise|"""If two brothers decide to enter into a lifelong commitment, the arguments in favor of gay marriage make it clear that they should have the right to do so."
8400| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Homosexuality is more benign than incest on the family.
8400| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Homosexuality does not have a direct impact on how family members interact with one-another.
8401| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Incestuous relationships are more prone to abuse than homosexual ones.
8401| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Homosexuality is typically a relationship between equal parties.
8402| Legalization of adult incest|conclusion|Offspring of first-cousins have a low chance of defects.
8402| Legalization of adult incest|premise|Multiple studies show that the risk of defects among the offspring of first cousins is roughly 7%.
8403| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Individuals have the right to control their bodies and consume drugs.
8403| Legalization of drugs|premise|Individuals have sovereignty over their own bodies and should be free to make choices which affect them and not other individuals.
8404| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Drug-use does not directly harm others, so it should be legalized.
8404| Legalization of drugs|premise|Indirect social harm is not a sufficient criteria for illegalizing something.
8405| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|The state is justified in protecting individuals from their own drug-consumption.
8405| Legalization of drugs|premise|The state has the authority vested in it by the people to protect individuals from doing harm to themselves and others.
8406| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|The state is justified in protecting society from drug-users.
8406| Legalization of drugs|premise|Drug-use affects the user, their families, children, communities and society at large, and the state must legislate to protect these wider interests.
8408| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Drugs are not a free choice.
8408| Legalization of drugs|premise|Doing drugs may be a free choice once, twice.
8409| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Drugs can have a beneficial mind-expanding capacity.
8409| Legalization of drugs|premise|Many drugs are used by philosophically inclined individuals for the purpose of expanding their minds and better understanding and seeing the world around them.
8410| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Many things are harmful to individuals, but aren't made illegal.
8410| Legalization of drugs|premise|The legal drugs tobacco and alcohol have a devastating consequence on society, and yet they are legal.
8411| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Legal drug consumption blurs the line drawn against illegal drug consumption.
8411| Legalization of drugs|premise|Psychoactive drugs are widely available and consumed in societies today.
8412| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Prohibition also costs lives.
8412| Legalization of drugs|premise|Because the chances of any given drug user getting caught are miniscule (which means that the deterrent effect of the law is also marginal), there is a lucrative market to be supplied, which organised crime is happy to fill.
8413| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Attempting to alter with drug-use the God-given human state-of-mind is immoral.
8413| Legalization of drugs|premise|Humans perceive the world how they do for a specific reason; God or nature determined it is the way human are supposed to perceive the world.
8414| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Hedonistic drug-use is morally repugnant.
8414| Legalization of drugs|premise|"Drugs are typically used because the ""high"" feels good or is pleasurable in some way."
8415| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|The negative effects of drug-use make it morally wrong and appropriate for governments to ban.
8415| Legalization of drugs|premise|"The effects of marijuana-use include, dullness during the ""high"", increased appetite, lower sex-drive, and impaired short-term memory."
8416| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Legalization would send the wrong message that drug-use is acceptable.
8416| Legalization of drugs|premise|Consumption is wrong and should never be authorized.
8417| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Drug prohibition does not correlate with decreased use.
8417| Legalization of drugs|premise|"""fear of legalisation is based in large part on the presumption that more people would take drugs under a legal regime."
8418| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Legalization would change drug consumption from a criminal to a health issue.
8418| Legalization of drugs|premise|Drug consumption is principally an activity that is bad for the consumer's health, like eating fatty foods.
8419| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Legalization of drugs will remove the rebellious glamor of it.
8419| Legalization of drugs|premise|Teenagers are often attracted to rebellious activities as their freedoms as individuals are expanded and the as the control of parents recedes.
8420| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|The state can tax the sale of legalized drugs and use the revenue for treatment programs.
8420| Legalization of drugs|premise|By taxing legal drug sales, governments could use the revenues to help improve treatment and lower consumption.
8421| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|No matter what, deterrence does not work.
8421| Legalization of drugs|premise|Drug users are not fully rational and do not study law before taking drugs.
8422| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Lower prices due to legalization of drugs will increase consumption.
8422| Legalization of drugs|premise|This will be the case among all groups - addicts, previously casual users, and those who were not previously users.
8423| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|The legalization of drugs will increase consumption.
8423| Legalization of drugs|premise|If a consumer can go to their local drug store around the corner to obtain drugs with greater ease, they are more likely to do so.
8425| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|"""Forbidden fruit"" concept is nonsense."
8425| Legalization of drugs|premise|People do not do drugs because they are illegal, they do drugs because they are a quick and easy way out of problems.
8426| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Legalization enables measurement of abuser populations.
8426| Legalization of drugs|premise|Under prohibition no proper studies can be done because we can't take proper measurements of the supply side, we don't know who is using what.
8427| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|By legalizing drugs, the state can regulate the sale.
8427| Legalization of drugs|premise|Those who want to use drugs will take them whether they are legal or not.
8428| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|There is no such thing as a safe drug .
8428| Legalization of drugs|premise|In practice this usually just means making drugs purer, and therefore perhaps more deadly and addictive.
8429| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|We have to look at there evidence of times that this has been attempted.
8429| Legalization of drugs|premise|The government takes no effort to moniter the dangerious effects of thc, a substance known to be linked to schizophrenia in for example the Netherlands, this has allowed the harmful effects of the drug to rise significantly throughout te period that it has been legal there.
8431| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|There is no contradiction in being pro-legalization yet anti-drug use.
8431| Legalization of drugs|premise|Legalization is in the best interests of fighting drug consumption.
8432| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|It is unfair to tax one product differently than another.
8432| Legalization of drugs|premise|Taxing one product, such as recreational drugs, differently than another product, such as prescription drugs, places an unfair burden on one segment of consumers.
8433| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|It is wrong for governments to obtain tax-revenue from immoral behavior.
8433| Legalization of drugs|premise|Governments should not be attempting to obtain tax-revenue from an illicit, immoral behavior.
8434| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|If taxes are too high, they are ineffective.
8434| Legalization of drugs|premise|because black market won't be eliminated.
8435| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|Legalizing drugs would eliminate an industry that drives gangs and criminal activities.
8435| Legalization of drugs|premise|Price controls would mean that addicts would no longer have to steal to fund their habits, and a state-provided drug services would put dealers out of business, starving criminal gangs of their main source of funding.
8436| Legalization of drugs|conclusion|An immoral drug-trade should be confined to criminal-agents rather than governments.
8436| Legalization of drugs|premise|"Technically speaking, legalizing drugs will reduce ""crime"" in the simple sense that drugs will no longer be illegal and selling drugs will no longer be a crime."
8438| Legalization of homosexuality in India|conclusion|Societies should embrace change, including allowing homosexuality.
8438| Legalization of homosexuality in India|premise|The activists who support homosexuality state that it is high time that we become more open to modernization and move on from being a conservative society.
8439| Legalization of homosexuality in India|conclusion|Legalizing homosexuality is a wrongful act of endorsement.
8439| Legalization of homosexuality in India|premise|"Babu Joseph, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, said in June of 2009: ""We are against calling homosexuality a criminal activity, but we are certainly in principle against legalizing it, because that would mean the state endorsing same-sex relationships."
8440| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|There is no evidence that marijuana decreases cognitive functions.
8440| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"A 15-year John Hopkins University study published in May 1999 found ""no significant differences in cognitive decline between heavy users, light users, and non-users of cannabis."
8441| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is no more harmful than tobacco and alcohol.
8441| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Although cannabis does indeed have some harmful effects, it is no more harmful than legal substances like alcohol and tobacco.
8442| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana can have a beneficial mind-altering effect if used right.
8442| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Marijuana use can alter one's perception of reality or consciousness.
8443| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|"Weighing marijuana's ""mind-expansion"" against its costs is subjective."
8443| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"Who can say that marijuana use is ""worth it"" or ""not worth it""? Many individuals strongly believe that marijuana use has a ""mind expanding"" effect that makes the health costs worth it."
8445| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is not toxic to humans.
8445| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"""London -- One of the active chemicals in cannabis inhibits psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia, according to a study which compared it with a leading anti-psychotic drug."
8446| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is not addictive.
8446| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|There is no evidence that marijuana physically addictive.
8447| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|It is a myth that marijuana use can cause schizophrenia.
8447| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Dr.
8448| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana has many CONFIRMED medicinal uses.
8448| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|It was widely used to treat glaucoma, give relief to chemotherapy recipients, and also as a TREATMENT for many psychological disorders (such as social anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder).
8449| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana has been used in religious rites and rituals for thousands of years.
8449| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|If venomous snakes in religious rites and rituals (often used on congregational children) cannot be banned in this country (which the Supreme Court decided is constitutionally protected), then what right does the government have to prohibit the use of an obviously less deadly practice such as the consumption of marijuana? It is for every person ALONE to decide what is spiritually beneficial to them.
8450| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is worse for individuals and society than alcohol.
8450| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Both alcohol and marijuana impair judgement.
8451| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is worse for individuals and society than tobacco.
8451| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Both cigarettes and marijuana do damage to the lungs.
8452| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is addictive.
8452| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"There are many studies that demonstrate a ""dependency"" relationship evolving between individuals and marijuana."
8453| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana impairs brain functions.
8453| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Many researches conclude that marijuana impairs short-term memory, cognition, and motivations.
8454| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana smoke is highly damaging to the lungs.
8454| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Marijuana smoke is more potent than cigarette smoke, with some researches concluding that the negative effect of one joint is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes.
8455| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana use impairs hormone production.
8455| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|It is frequently cited that marijuana use leads to reductions in sperm levels.
8456| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|That marijuana is herbal does not mean it is safe.
8456| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"Some argue that marijuana is ""OK"" because it's ""natural"", ""herbal"", or ""comes from the earth""."
8457| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana use can lead to cancer.
8457| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Just like with cigarettes, the intake of carcinogens in marijuana risks causing cancer.
8458| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana use causes apoptosis or programmed cell death.
8458| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Unlike alcohol and tobacco, cannabis has a hallucinatory effect on the mind.
8459| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Uncertainty of marijuana's health effects makes illegality prudent.
8459| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|There certainly remains uncertainty and debate about marijuana's health effects.
8460| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Individuals should be free to harm themselves.
8460| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|If an individual wants to harm themselves, they should be free to do so.
8461| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|People should be free to use marijuana as long as it harms no one else.
8461| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|People should be at liberty to treat their bodies how they want to.
8462| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|The choice to use marijuana should be based on individual experience.
8462| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Marijuana induces different experiences in different individuals; some of these experiences are great, some are terrible and harmful.
8463| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|If marijuana is harmful, isn't this sufficient punishment for users.
8463| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|If marijuana is harmful, shouldn't individuals be at liberty to experience the punishment of a poor choice, and shouldn't this mean that marijuana use entails its own punishments that requires no imposed government punishment.
8464| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana's social costs should not be arbitrarily discriminated against.
8464| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Marijuana may indeed have indirect social costs, such as increased healthcare costs, increased risks on the road, and others.
8465| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is only unhealthy or risky when abused.
8465| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|The problem with illegalizing marijuana is that it lumps the most moderate of uses of marijuana in with the worst of abuses.
8466| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Use of Marijuana  is a choice.
8466| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Many people seem to be under the impression that the use of illegal drugs is something that may be forced on someone.
8467| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Historic leaders would oppose social engineering on Marijuana-use.
8467| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"Thomas Jefferson: ""I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them."
8468| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Judgement and common sense cannot be legislated.
8468| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|No matter what research you read of who's stories you listen to, the fact remains that the bad or good aspects of marijuana use are above all else subjective, and in essence an oppinion.
8469| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|The State is justified in protecting individuals from themselves.
8469| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Even if marijuana's effects were isolated to the individual, there is room for the state to protect individuals from harming themselves.
8470| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|"Some are ""pressured"" into marijuana consumption without a ""choice""."
8470| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|The notion that individuals should be free to make the choice to consume marijuana is predicated on the notion that they are fully informed of the costs and are in a position of detached judgement.
8471| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana use directly threatens other's liberties.
8471| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Various risks to other citizens are greatly enhanced by marijuana use.
8472| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Instances of brutal violence and murder are tied to marijuana use.
8472| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Instances of brutal violence and murder have been cited as caused, to some extent, by marijuana use and impaired judgement.
8473| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana's harm to individuals spill over onto communities and society.
8473| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|To argue that individual consumption of marijuana entails only individual consequences is to argue that individuals exist in something of a vacuum.
8474| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Illegal marijuana forces consumers to interact with criminal underground.
8474| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Presently, cannabis is sold by dealers who have connections with the underworld.
8475| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Illegal Marijuana directly produces socially deviant behavior.
8475| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|With Marijuana being illegal, those who participate in it's use are automatically engaging in socially deviant behavior.
8477| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|"Children have been brainwashed on ""high costs"" of marijuana."
8477| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"It is the contention by proponents of prohibition that our youth ""grow up in a society where they have no knowledge of the costs"" of marijuana usage."
8478| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Legalization of marijuana would make it easier for scientific studies to take place.
8478| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|thereby increasing the public knowledge-base and providing a more accurate picture of the physical, psychological, spiritual and sociologic effects of the drug.
8479| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is the drug for life's losers.
8479| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"If we want to produce a better society, there is some room for ""big brother"" regulations to prevent citizens from doing harm to themselves."
8480| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Legalization of marijuana would worsen schools performance.
8480| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Assuming that legalization would lead to increased accessibility and consumption, and that marijuana impairs cognition and learning, it is fair to say that legalization will likely damage student performance in schools.
8482| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|The Netherlands has lower Marijuana consumption rates than the United States.
8482| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|The Netherlands, which has permitted the possession and retail sale of marijuana since 1976, actually ranks lower than the United States in the percentage of people who have ever used marijuana in every age category, has a higher age of initiation among those that do try marijuana, and fewer adolescents in the Netherlands than in the United States use other illegal drugs.
8483| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Government research discounts relationship between illegality and usage.
8483| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Lloyd Johnston, Ph.
8484| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|The legalization of marijuana will increase consumption.
8484| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Legalization of marijuana will make the drug more accessible, affordable, and acceptable, making its increased consumption a near certainty.
8485| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Illegalization of marijuana helps deter use.
8485| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|The illegality of marijuana deters consumption through the threat of punishment.
8486| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Illegality of marijuana sets moral standard against consumption.
8486| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Laws provide a clear societal standard.
8487| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|There is little evidence that Marijuana is a gateway drug.
8487| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|If marijuana was a gateway drug, you would expect to see high numbers of marijuana consumers also being, for instance, cocaine users.
8488| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|"Marijuana may be a ""gateway drug"" because it's in the drug blackmarket."
8488| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Marijuana is often criticized as being a gateway drug to harder drugs, and this is used as a justification for its illegality.
8489| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana is a gateway drug.
8489| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|"Marijuana is considered a ""soft"" drug, as compared with ""harder"" drugs such as cocaine, heroine, and crystal meth."
8490| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Far too many people are imprisoned for the possession of marijuana.
8490| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|In America, around 800,000 people are arrested on marijuana related charges each year.
8491| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Special marijuana courts do not relieve strain on court system.
8491| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|While some argue that special courts bypass the normal court process and thus relieve court strains.
8492| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana consumers are typically not convicted of a crime.
8492| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Many marijuana offenders are not convicted of a crime.
8494| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Increased crime from marijuana legalization adds to judicial burdens.
8494| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Many contend that marijuana's illegality actually leads to more crime, particularly in organized crime, which adds to judicial burdens.
8495| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Marijuana special courts can help deal with judicial overload.
8495| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|This is an appropriate response to any strains placed on the judicial system by marijuana cases.
8496| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Legalizing marijuana will decrease crime by ending criminality of drugs.
8496| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|Smoking marijana is not forbidden in the Netherlands.
8497| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Legalizing marijuana will reduce profits of traffickers and gangs.
8497| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|With reduced profits for illegal marijuana sales, sellers of illegal marijuana will decrease.
8498| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Rise of criminal acts associated with Marijuana addiction is directly related to a prohibition.
8498| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|The main reasons is because the use is prohibited, then the price is high and is hard to obtain, that conduct to a criminal acts to obtain the drug.
8499| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Contradictory arguments by opposition.
8499| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|We cannot, in the same breath, say that crime will rise if marijuana is legalized because users will commit more crimes to obtain it, yet maintain that prohibition and harsher penalties are now keeping usage down.
8501| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Legal marijuana can be taxed for revenue gain.
8501| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|According to a study conducted by Harvard Professor Dr.
8502| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Added health costs from legal marijuana will outweigh new tax revenues.
8502| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|If consumption increases from marijuana use, as most expect, clear health costs will rise.
8503| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Increased legal marijuana consumption will decrease economic productivity.
8503| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|If marijuana consumption can be concluded as leading to decreased cognition, short-term member, and motivation, and if legalization can concluded as likely to raise consumption, than the result of legalization will be to marginally decrease productivity in the market place.
8504| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Legal marijuana's social costs will negate new tax revenues.
8504| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|The degradation of family and community relations has major economic costs.
8505| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|Users simply smoke less of potent pot to achieve the same high.
8505| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|There is nothing sinister or dangerous about potent pot.
8506| Legalization of Marijuana|conclusion|The public is sick of wasting tax dollars on marijuana.
8506| Legalization of Marijuana|premise|The public is sick of the billions of wasted dollars per year just to lock people up, with no effect on drug availability.
8510| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Control of one’s own body is the most fundamental of human rights.
8510| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|No government should be permitted to define how its citizens can express themselves.
8511| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Every government has a duty to protect the moral and physical health of all its citizens, even from themselves in some circumstances.
8511| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|Firstly, the defining characteristic of sado-masochism is that it does harm to others.
8512| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|A prohibition of sado-masochism is simply inconsistent with the liberty that governments already permit their citizens to injure each other and themselves.
8512| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|When people are entitled to risk pain, serious injury, or even death in sporting activity, why should they not also be permitted to suffer some discomfort in consensual sexual activity ?The same piercing of flesh which attracts criminal liability in a fetishistic context can be performed legally in a chemist’s shop or tattooist’s parlour.
8513| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Counter that boxing is a primary example of an activity that involves the direct, intentional harm to one's self and other individuals, and which is legal.
8513| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|As such, how can sadomasochism be banned without being seen as arbitrary.
8514| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|The crucial distinction between dangerous sports and sado-masochism is that sporting injuries are suffered accidentally and occasionally.
8514| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|Sado-masochistic wounds are inflicted deliberately as the very object of the activity.
8515| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Sado-masochism need not be rendered completely free of risk, as long as the risks are understood by the consenting parties.
8515| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|It is sufficient that each participant is aware of the hazards and consents to them.
8516| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Sado-masochism can be rendered relatively free of physical risk for its participants.
8516| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|Safe words’ can be agreed in advance and announced to end immediately the activity in question.
8517| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Sado-masochism is already practised without a significant degree of complaint.
8517| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|Even the case of R v.
8518| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Sado-masochism is dangerous.
8518| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|The consequence of the infliction of injury is commonly bleeding.
8519| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Safe words are ludicrously impractical.
8519| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|Their utility is dependent upon their actually being agreed and committed to memory in advance ; and their declaration being heeded by the actors in the heat of sexual activity.
8520| Legalization of sado-masochism|conclusion|Legalization of sado-masochism holds a number of risks to the application of the law.
8520| Legalization of sado-masochism|premise|Even the most liberal government would protect its citizens by prohibiting activities that lead to death or serious injury.
8523| Liberalization of agri-food trade|conclusion|Scrapping trade distortions is desirable.
8523| Liberalization of agri-food trade|premise|Quotas, tariffs, and other trade barriers disrupt international trade and the market as they can contribute to market failure, therefore their scrapping is desirable.
8524| Libertarianism|conclusion|Individuals have a right to own themselves with full independence.
8524| Libertarianism|premise|If an individual wants to live in the forest in complete seclusion and without any interaction with other humans beings, shouldn't he be allowed to do so? Why should other people and government have binding rights over that individual? This is the reality in modernity, and contradicts our natural state as fully independent and self-sufficient creatures.
8525| Libertarianism|conclusion|People choose best for themselves.
8525| Libertarianism|premise|When people are given the choice of what they want to do, they are likely to choose the one that is best for themselves and society.
8526| Libertarianism|conclusion|Individuals are entirely free, except to violate the freedoms of others.
8526| Libertarianism|premise|A bedrock principle of Libertarianism is that citizens have rights that nobody can violate.
8527| Libertarianism|conclusion|People are free moral creatures, accountable to nobody but themselves.
8527| Libertarianism|premise|Individuals are independent in their ability to make moral choices based on their own moral compass.
8528| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarianism offers voters an important political alternative.
8528| Libertarianism|premise|It is important that voters have alternatives.
8529| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarians overlook that government/law exist to preserve rights.
8529| Libertarianism|premise|Most Libertarians consider government the main impediment to individual rights.
8530| Libertarianism|conclusion|Individuals must cede some rights to gain collective, democratic power.
8530| Libertarianism|premise|l John Jay, FEDERALIST No.
8531| Libertarianism|conclusion|"Libertarian ""full self-ownership"" permits voluntary enslavement."
8531| Libertarianism|premise|If an individual has the full right to own and control themselves, this means that they have the full right to transfer that ownership to others.
8532| Libertarianism|conclusion|Free market economics fosters capitalist authoritarianism.
8532| Libertarianism|premise|The only thing that can replace civil, democratic government would be a form of free-market governance.
8533| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarianism contradicted by mere existence of body of law.
8533| Libertarianism|premise|"Nevada Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa (replying to county-rights advocates), 1993 - ""There has been little or no mention of the vast body of law which contradicts your position."
8534| Libertarianism|conclusion|People should not be forced to interact with a government.
8534| Libertarianism|premise|Even when people do not want to interact with the government, they are currently forced to do so.
8536| Libertarianism|conclusion|Making all government interaction voluntary would cause a huge increase in crime.
8536| Libertarianism|premise|All criminals would choose not to interact with government, and, as a result, no one is preventing them from committing crimes.
8537| Libertarianism|conclusion|People can not always be trusted to make the right choices.
8537| Libertarianism|premise|Without compulsory government, it would be down to individuals to make the right choices.
8538| Libertarianism|conclusion|People have full rights to their property that governments can't deprive.
8538| Libertarianism|premise|Governments violate the rights of citizen when they force, or threaten to force, individuals to transfer their legitimately held wealth to the state in order to provide for pensions, to help the needy, or to pay for public goods (e.
8541| Libertarianism|conclusion|People should be able to choose.
8541| Libertarianism|premise|By having government people are restricted in their freedom of choice as the government restricts what people are able to do.
8542| Libertarianism|conclusion|Government benefits don't justify the means.
8542| Libertarianism|premise|While government might produce some benefits, these benefits are not justified by the means.
8543| Libertarianism|conclusion|Government is corrupt and works against the interests of the people.
8543| Libertarianism|premise|"Neil Smith - ""To politicians, solved problems represent a dire threat — of unemployment and poverty."
8544| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarianism was the philosophy of many US Founding Fathers .
8544| Libertarianism|premise|Many of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America advocated very vocally for the highest degree of individual rights, and the protection of those rights.
8545| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarianism abandons the social contract and Western political thought.
8545| Libertarianism|premise|It is important to consider that Libertarianism is quite radical in the way it calls for abandoning the social contract, the foundation of western political thought.
8546| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarianism does not allow for essential public services .
8546| Libertarianism|premise|Because Libertarianism does not allow for the collectivization of resources, it does not afford the sufficient resources to a public to provide essential public resources such as roads.
8547| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarianism contradicts the need for government monopoly of force.
8547| Libertarianism|premise|It is commonly understood in Western democracies that a government and civilian leaders have a monopoly over the use of force.
8548| Libertarianism|conclusion|People need government to prevent them from making mistakes.
8548| Libertarianism|premise|The laws enacted by the government are there to protect people and prevent them from making mistakes.
8550| Libertarianism|conclusion|Free-market economics is the ideal form of governance.
8550| Libertarianism|premise|"""And God saw everything he had made, and he saw that it was very good; and God said, It just goes to show Me what the private sector can accomplish."
8551| Libertarianism|conclusion|Libertarians are rightly against trade blocs and for free trade.
8551| Libertarianism|premise|Libertarians, because they believe that all economic transactions should be free from government intervention, believe in the economic theories of free trade.
8553| Libertarianism|conclusion|Free-market capitalism is a sub-optimal socio-economic model.
8553| Libertarianism|premise|"David Shea - ""I'm skeptical of claims based solely on logical deduction, especially in the social sciences."
8554| Libertarianism|conclusion|Free market capitalism is a non-existent myth in modernity.
8554| Libertarianism|premise|"Jonathan Stein - ""Once we begin distinguishing the many forms capitalism can take, analytic utility is lost by retaining talismanic terms like ""free market."

8588| Lifetime ban of athletes using drugs in sports|premise|Performance-enhancing drugs should be acceptable.
8589| Lifetime ban of athletes using drugs in sports|conclusion|"Performance-enhancing drugs are consistent with trends away from ""natural ability""."
8589| Lifetime ban of athletes using drugs in sports|premise|The criteria that athletes should only be applying their 'natural abilities' also runs into trouble.

8590| Lifetime ban of athletes using drugs in sports|premise|Drugs are illegal.
8592| Lifetime ban of athletes using drugs in sports|conclusion|A life-time sports ban does not fit the crime of drug use.

8609| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|Economic growth is best when it comes from within.
8609| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|The available money supply within the economy is a fairly accurate indicator of its ability for self-sustained growth.
8610| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|Putting a cap on foreign investment and so reducing the likelihood of a bubble economy developing acts as a spur to local investors to invest their money in the home economy.
8610| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|Its prices are likely to be lower, because the investment money supply has been tightened.
8611| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|A cap would reduce foreign investment, which is critical to economic growth.
8611| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|At the straightforward level of analysis, imposing a cap means limiting the amount of inward investment.
8612| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|The message a cap sends out will scare off investors.
8612| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|Even if they are able to invest because, for example, the cap has not yet been reached, investors will consider that the government has a nationalistic economic policy that they are willing to vary to suit the home economy.
8613| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|The system is flexible and so can meet needs as they change throughout the economic cycle.
8613| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|For example, having decided in principle to impose a cap on foreign investment, this level can be raised or lowered in line with what is best for the economy at any given time.
8614| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|Regulation would impose new transaction costs. Policing the limit would cause delay and cost money.
8614| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|These additional transaction costs, and the even greater uncertainties of operating within a flexible system (i.
8615| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|A cap would insulate the home economy from the extremities of the global economy.

8616| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|Globalisation means that economies are becoming more not less interdependent.
8617| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|A cap acts as a disincentive to swift withdrawal of funds.
8617| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|Given that there is a limit on investment, any existing foreign investor will think carefully before withdrawing funds from the economy.
8618| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|A cap would raise the cost of capital and so slow the economy.
8618| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|A cap would limit the pool of capital available for business.
8619| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|Any cap may be subject to challenge or reciprocation by other countries.
8619| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|It could spark some form of trade sanctions, which would be damaging to the economy, especially its export industries.
8620| Limitations on foreign investment|conclusion|A cap sends a clear message to the world that a nation is serious about preserving its interests.
8620| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|This represents a strengthening of the expression of national interest and so is a good thing in itself.

8621| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|Inward investment is nothing more than a form of economic imperialism.

8622| Limitations on foreign investment|premise|Any such curbs are a form of barrier to free trade and a step towards protectionism.
8624| Lobbying|conclusion|Lobbying is an expression of freedom of speech.
8624| Lobbying|premise|"The First Amendment of the United States Constitution, for example, states: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."
8625| Lobbying|conclusion|Lobbying is routed in historic democratic principles.
8625| Lobbying|premise|"""The concept of entitling citizens to petition their government did not originate with the authors of the Constitution."
8627| Lobbying|conclusion|Corruption exists equally in lobbying as other professions.

8629| Lowering of drinking age|premise|Studies have shown that limited alcohol consumption (a couple of glasses of red wine per week) can actually have positive health benefits.

8631| Lowering of drinking age|premise|People who start drinking before they are old enough become socialised into a heavy drinking culture at an impressionable age, and partly because of the state of their physical development.
8632| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Age limits make drinking rebellious and cool.
8632| Lowering of drinking age|premise|The British and US limits on drinking alcohol do not stop teenagers from consuming alcohol, instead it makes underage drinking cool and so makes teenagers more likely to do it.
8633| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|When it is harder to get alcohol, young people binge drink.
8633| Lowering of drinking age|premise|With higher alcohol age limits, young people in the UK and US find it harder to get alcohol and so binge-drink when they do.
8634| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Teenagers will always rebel against limits on their behavior.
8634| Lowering of drinking age|premise|If they are allowed alcohol at 16 instead of 18, some other activity such as soft drug use will quickly replace it in the cool stakes.
8635| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Continental drinking cultures are not mature.
8635| Lowering of drinking age|premise|The myth of a mature continental drinking culture may hold true for a small middle class community, but is not representative of most peoples’ experience.
8636| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Adults will not be more responsible role models with a lower drinking age.
8636| Lowering of drinking age|premise|There is also no reason to think that British adults, many of whom have just as excessive an approach to alcohol consumption as teenagers, will suddenly become better role models if the law is changed to fit this continental image.
8637| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|At sixteen, young adults are legaly allowed to do many new things.
8637| Lowering of drinking age|premise|Fundamentally this is an issue of the freedom to choose.
8638| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|At sixteen, young adults are not allowed to do several key things.
8638| Lowering of drinking age|premise|We do not allow sixteen year olds to do several key things, like vote or drive so clearly there is no set line of where adulthood begins.

8639| Lowering of drinking age|premise|At the age of sixteen, teenagers are not allowed to do key things like smoking and gambling.
8640| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Most 18 year-olds who want to drink are forced to do it secretely.
8640| Lowering of drinking age|premise|As teenagers are unable to drink legally in pubs or bars, but are old enough to want to socialise on an evening, they are forced to do it secretly on streets and in parks.
8641| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Lowering the drink age could also lower teenage crime.
8641| Lowering of drinking age|premise|It also makes it more likely that younger children will be exposed to alcohol and is often one of the causes of teenage crime, vandalism and violence.
8642| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Most twenty-somethings do want to drink with 15 year-olds.
8642| Lowering of drinking age|premise|Even if the drinking age was lowered, there would still be a division in the marketplace because most twenty-somethings do want to drink and socialise with sixteen year olds.
8643| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Most bars and pubs would let in 16 year-olds, if the drinking age was lowered.
8643| Lowering of drinking age|premise|With an age limit of 16, chains such as All Bar One have age limits of 16.
8644| Lowering of drinking age|conclusion|Young adults often can afford pubs and would simply buy liquor cheaply at supermarkets.
8644| Lowering of drinking age|premise|Many teenagers buy alcohol cheaply in a supermarket and then drink it in a park because it is less expensive than going to a pub or bar.

8701| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""What about the consumer's right not to know? The same research that supporters of menu mandates like to cite indicates that most consumers prefer to avoid calorie counts, enjoying their food in blissful ignorance."
8702| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts rightly value health over blissful ignorance.
8702| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"There is no such thing as ""blissful ignorance""."
8703| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|"Only small minority prefers ""blissful ignorance"" to calories on menus."
8703| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|It is probably true that some people would prefer not to know how many calories are in the food that they are consuming.
8705| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Large majorities of citizens want calorie counts on menus.
8705| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""A survey by the agency of more than 2,000 adults last summer suggested 85% of consumers agreed restaurants, pubs and cafes had a responsibility to make clear what was in the food they served, and later research showed people wanted clear, simple information at the point of sale."
8706| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Customers are indifferent to calorie counts on menus.
8706| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"In other words, consumers aren't really demanding ""a choice"", and calorie counts on menus."
8707| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts cause consumers to make healthier choices.
8707| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""A new survey conducted by foodservice consultants Technomic, Inc."
8708| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts will be ignored by some, but help others.

8709| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|New York’s health commissioner, Dr.
8710| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts are worth a try as they do no harm.
8710| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Rachel Johnson, a professor of nutrition at the University of Vermont who co-authored a skeptical paper about the effect of menu labeling, said, “There is a need for additional research to determine if ultimately providing calorie labeling in restaurants will help stop the progression of overweight and obesity among the American public.
8711| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Customers will pay more attention to calorie counts over time.
8711| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|While it may be true that some tests have shown that many restaurant goers do not necessarily pay attention to calorie counts, this will change over time as more customers learn that the information is there and learn how to read calorie counts appropriately and judge them according to one's optimal daily calorie intake.
8712| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts are ineffective at compelling healthier choices.
8712| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""with the rise of the Internet, Americans have access to more such information today than ever before."

8717| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Margo G.
8718| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counting is a critical component of a healthy diet.
8718| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|While it is true that calorie counting alone is not sufficient for a healthy diet - as one could simply eat two hamburgers a day and meet their calorie requirements - it is true that it is a critical component of a healthy diet.
8719| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calories alone are not a good measure of healthy menus.
8719| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""the problem is, a nudge is only worthwhile if it nudges you in the right direction."
8720| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calories on menus add to forbidden-fruit allure of high-calorie meals.
8720| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"Frequently, when something is labelled as ""bad"", it becomes more desirable as a ""forbidden fruit""."

8721| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Dr.
8722| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calories on menus pressure restaurants to make healthier meals.
8722| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""But the point is that requiring this nationally would compel restaurants to re-invent their menus, because they wouldn’t want everything on the menu to be over 1,000 calories."
8723| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Restaurants will not under-report calories and risk PR backlash.
8723| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Restaurants that get caught under-reporting calories on their menus may face not only fines from the government, but also significant PR problems as stories of their manipulations reach and turn-off their customers.
8724| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Restaurants frequently under-report calories on menus.
8724| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""Scripps television stations sent several menu items to testing labs and found some big deviations from posted calorie content, most of them making menu items appear healthier than they are."
8725| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calories on menus help reduce health care costs.
8725| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""The Menu Education and Labeling Act, known as MEAL, would require restaurant chains with 20 or more stores to display calorie counts on their menu boards."
8726| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|If calorie counts cost unhealthy restaurants customers, good riddens.
8726| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|If calorie counts cause restaurants that make very unhealthy food to lose customers, good riddens.
8727| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts incentivize healthier menus that attract new customers.
8727| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|If restaurants respond to mandatory calorie counts on menus by producing healthier foods, they will attract new, more health-conscious customers.
8728| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts a better option than taxing unhealthy foods.

8729| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Restaurants can cheaply calculate calories with new software.
8729| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""Providing calorie counts on menus requires restaurants to know how many calories are in different foods, of course, and the legislation says that restaurants can use software that includes the calorie counts of many ingredients to determine their foods’ calorie counts, rather than relying on more expensive analytical methods."
8730| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts on menus would be very costly for restaurants.
8730| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Testing and counting the calories in all the different items on a restaurant menu is very expensive.
8731| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts on menus will turn-off customers.
8731| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Many restaurants will lose customers because they are forced to post calorie information on their menus, which is not particularly attractive or appetizing to customers.
8732| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts over-crowd valuable menu space.
8732| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Adding calorie counts to menus will general crowd menus with excess writing and information, making them less attractive and turning off customers.
8733| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|It is difficult for restaurants to keep calorie counts consistent.
8733| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|It is a challenge in most restaurants - which do not work off of exact measurements of fat, butter, and olive oil - to keep the number of calories consistent within a meal each time it is prepared.
8734| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie counts eliminate ability of restaurants to be spontaneous.
8734| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|How can restaurants be spontaneous with items on their menus if they always must list the calories in each item? They can't.
8735| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Enforcing calorie counts laws will be expensive for the state.
8735| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Enforcing calorie count laws will be very expensive, as it requires that the government test and re-test each restaurant's foods to ensure that they continue to live up to the calorie counts they have provided on their menu.
8736| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Companies focus on profits, so will not voluntarily list calories.
8736| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|Companies never do what is best for the customer voluntarily, unless it increases their profit margins.
8737| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|No restaurant will be disadvantaged if all are required to list calories.
8737| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|By requiring all business to display calorie counts, any negative effect of such an act would have less of an impact on any restaurant, because everyone would have it, preventing consumers from wrongly thinking a restaurant that doesn't show calories is more healthy than one that doesn't.
8738| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Marketplace can encourage restaurants to voluntarily list calories.
8738| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|If consumers care about calorie counts they will demand them on menus, eventually leading to businesses adopting calorie counts on their own out of necessity and desire for business.
8739| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|conclusion|Calorie info is more effective on menus than elsewhere.
8739| Mandatory calorie counts on menus|premise|"""The restaurant industry, including McDonald’s, has been backing the proposed Labeling Education and Nutrition Act, called LEAN."

8751| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Labeling foods makes it possible for individuals to choose to take on the risks involved, or to avoid them.
8752| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|"Labeling would make ""superior"" GM foods stand out."
8752| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"Labeling would make it clear to consumers which foods, fruits, and vegetables on the shelves are GM and which are not, which would make clearer the ""superiority"" of GM products."
8753| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling ensures vegetarians can avoid GM food animal ingredients.
8753| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|For religious or ethical reasons, many individuals want to avoid eating animal products, including animal DNA.

8754| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Unlabelled GM foods may include GM ingredients or DNA from certain animals or other sources that people of certain faiths strongly oppose consuming.
8755| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Consumers can avoid GM foods by eating organic.
8755| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Organic foods are without GM ingredients.
8756| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Arbitrary labeling rules do not offer any real choice.
8756| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"""Although GM food labelling is already mandatory, advocates claim that the stronger new labelling and traceability rules will ensure that consumers have more complete information, enabling them to make informed choices."
8757| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Difficulty enforcing GM food labels limits actual consumer choices.
8757| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"It is very difficult to test foods to ensure that those that are considered ""GM free"" are actually ""free"" of GM materials."
8758| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling of GM foods has not shown to change consumer behavior.
8758| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Surveys in Canada, Japan, Norway, the U.
8759| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Most don't mind GM foods, but would pay costs of labeling.
8759| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|One of the basic debates surrounding labeling regards the overall cost-benefit analysis to all individuals involved.
8760| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Cost of labeling GM foods are exaggerated by opponents.
8760| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"""Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods would cost much less than the food industry has claimed, a new study commissioned by Quebec's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reveals."
8761| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling of GM foods deters further market/trade disruptions.
8761| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Labeling would help reduce much of the international fear regarding importing from countries that produce GM foods.
8762| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling GM foods addresses market failure on consumer health.
8762| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Labeling GM foods responds to market failures to sufficiently protect consumers against the potential risks of GM foods.
8763| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling helps protect the legitimate place of GM foods.
8763| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"Labeling may actually be critical in protecting what might be called the ""legitimate place"" or niche for genetically modified foods, such as the use of GM foods to help end malnutrition in some countries."
8764| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling helps poorer countries avoid economic harm.
8764| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"""While safety concerns have been the focus of debate, the real problem is that genetic engineering is hurting the poor."

8765| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Labeling of genetically modified foods costs money.
8766| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling of genetically modified foods increases food prices.
8766| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Labeling of genetically modified foods makes it more expensive for many food companies to produce their foods, as it requires that they regulate their food production, check to ensure that they are below the GM food level.
8767| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|There is not much space on food products for GM labels.
8767| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Many food products have very limited space on their packaging for extra labels.
8768| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling of genetically modified foods segregates the market.
8768| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Labeling creates a market in which some goods are labeled and others are not.
8769| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling requires separate processing of GM and non-GM foods.
8769| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"""A At present, GM crops/foods and non-GM crops/foods are often mixed together during harvesting, storage or processing."

8772| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"""the federal government refuses to require such labeling, due to the lobbying efforts of the biotech corporations that have developed and profit from this technology and know that if these foods are labeled that consumers will not purchase them."
8773| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Labeling all foods containing any GM ingredients is impractical.
8773| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|There are too many foods in the modern era that contain some ingredients that are affected by genetic modification.
8774| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Defining GM and non-GM foods is nearly impossible.
8774| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Almost all foods are genetically modified in some way, either by cross-breeding of species, selective harvesting, or more modern engineering.
8775| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|Food producers opposing GM labels appear to be hiding risks.
8775| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Food producers that do not label would appear to have something to hide, particularly regarding the safety of GM foods.
8776| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM food producers opposing labels seem against consumer choice.
8776| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|Even if it is not the case, food producers opposing labeling their GM products give off the appearance of not carrying about their consumers' right to an informed choice in what they consume.
8777| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|conclusion|GM labeling improves confidence in food safety measures.
8777| Mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods|premise|"""Importance of labeling GM foods."

8827| Mandatory military service|premise|"""The study shows strong support among youth for universal service."
8828| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Mandatory sentencing acts as a useful deterrent against future crimes.
8828| Mandatory sentencing|premise|Potential criminals know with certainty what kind of sentence they will face if they are caught, and so are likely to think twice before they act illegally.
8829| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Various studies show that mandatory sentencing does not have a significant deterrent effect on crime.
8829| Mandatory sentencing|premise|These studies generally conclude that the length or severity of sentence is insignificant to criminals who believe they can act with impunity.
8830| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Popular pressure for a harsher legal system is increasingly strong.
8830| Mandatory sentencing|premise|Increasing the sentence for recidivism would restore an element of democratic faith in the justice system, and encourage reporting of relatively minor offences.
8831| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Democratic justice is not necessarily a good thing.
8831| Mandatory sentencing|premise|Studies have shown that, when asked to calculate sentences, the public’s response tends to match that of the judges.
8832| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Mandatory sentencing avoids the problem of judicial discretion, which undermines consistency across an entire country.
8832| Mandatory sentencing|premise|This leads to uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the judicial system.
8833| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Mandatory sentencing removes the possibility of judicial discretion, which threatens the principle that the punishment fits the crime.
8833| Mandatory sentencing|premise|Each case differs enormously in the details of the crime and the circumstances of the convicted defendant, which include the risk of their reoffending and the possibilities of rehabilitation.
8834| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Recidivism is not properly dealt with in many criminal law systems.
8834| Mandatory sentencing|premise|Mandatory sentencing policies can take into account repeat offences that indicate serious criminal risk -- e.
8835| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|The chances of recidivism are hugely increased when an individual comes into contact with other members of the prison population.
8835| Mandatory sentencing|premise|"Life imprisonment under ""three strikes"" when the third felony is relatively minor, and perhaps thirty years after the earlier crimes, is a disproportionate punishment."
8836| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Mandatory restorative justice is effective.
8836| Mandatory sentencing|premise|In countries where mandatory restorative justice has been implemented, levels of car theft and low-level burglary were reduced by up to a third.
8837| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Restorative justice does not work in every case.
8837| Mandatory sentencing|premise|It is only forced on criminals under thirty, and was shown to be ineffective in dealing with drugs crime.
8838| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|Mandatory sentencing will increase the efficiency of the judicial system.
8838| Mandatory sentencing|premise|It will free up a bottleneck in the judicial system by removing the need for lengthy and costly pre-sentencing reports, thus increasing efficiency.
8839| Mandatory sentencing|conclusion|There are not enough prison spaces left to account for the offenders that would fall under mandatory sentencing.
8839| Mandatory sentencing|premise|As the British and American examples show -- and the latter proves that harsher mandatory sentences do not reduce crime rates, but simply impact disproportionately on minority groups.
8840| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|A manned mission to Mars would inspire humankind.

8847| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""We learned in the 1960s that Mars's surface has features that, as far as we can tell, can only have been made in the presence of water: standing water, running water, deluging water."
8848| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Manned mission to Mars necessary to reveal underground life.
8848| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""Another reason why humans may have to be on site to conduct a thorough search for life stems from the fact that if any such life exists it is probably deep underground."
8849| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Mars mission would inspire kids to become scientists.
8849| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""The first manned landing on Mars would serve as an invitation to adventure for children around the world."
8850| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Many more unmanned scientific missions can be sent to Mars.
8850| Manned mission to Mars|premise|Because a robotic mission to Mars is so much cheaper than a manned mission, many more unmanned missions can be sent.
8851| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Robotic missions to Mars are equally effective as manned ones.
8851| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""Robotic exploration delivers countless advantages."

8855| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Willingness of astronauts to go to Mars does not justify mission.
8855| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""It’s not that American heroes are in short supply."
8856| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Mars will subject spacemen to high levels of radiation.
8856| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""NASA needs to come up with solutions for effectively protecting the astronauts from the high levels of cosmic radiation they will be exposed to in deep space and on the surface of Mars."
8857| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Artificial gravity can overcome zero-gravity on Mars mission.
8857| Manned mission to Mars|premise|The problem of zero gravity during the trip to Mars is actually not a problem at all: zero-gravity conditions can be eliminated altogether during the trip, as artificial gravity can be created through the use of centrifugal force.
8858| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|We can commit to Mars mission before knowing how.
8858| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society: ""This idea that you have to know how to do it before you can commit yourself to the program is completely false."

8860| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Mars is uniquely suitable for a manned mission.
8860| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""Mars, as cold as it is, is not as oppressive an environment as almost any other place we can think of going in the Solar System."
8861| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|No way to land safely and reliably.
8861| Manned mission to Mars|premise|There is no existing technology or one realizable in the foreseeable future, that can safely and reliably land a cargo of more than approximately one metric tonne to the surface of Mars.
8862| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Weight of supplies for long Mars trip is impractical.
8862| Manned mission to Mars|premise|The Apollo missions crammed as much food as possible to keep the astronauts alive and it ended up that even freeze-dried food is heavy.
8863| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Craft to Mars must carry exercise, artificial-gravity equipment.
8863| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"Because long periods of weighlessness deteriorates astronaut's bones, a ""Space Shuttle"" to Mars must make room for special exercise equipment and enough extra air for this exercising."

8864| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""The 20-minute communications lag."
8865| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|No Mars mission until it's faster, safer, cheaper.
8865| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""Rather than spend hundreds of billions of dollars to hurl tons toward Mars using current technology, why not take a decade--or two decades, or however much time is required--researching new launch systems and advanced propulsion? If new launch systems could put weight into orbit affordably, and if advanced propulsion could speed up that long, slow transit to Mars, then the dream of stepping onto the Red Planet might become reality."

8866| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""A manned mission to Mars just might single-handedly salvage what's left of the engineering profession here in the U."
8867| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|A manned mission to Mars would be too expensive.
8867| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""One objection to a manned mission to Mars is that robotic craft could do the job just as well at a fraction of the cost--a compelling argument as we watch the Spirit rover successfully bound (or rather inch) over the surface of the Red Planet."
8868| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Mars mission would require raising taxes, cutting social services.
8868| Manned mission to Mars|premise|"""Present systems for getting from Earth's surface to low-Earth orbit are so fantastically expensive that merely launching the 1,000 tons or so of spacecraft and equipment a Mars mission would require could be accomplished only by cutting health-care benefits, education spending or other important programs--or by raising taxes."
8869| Manned mission to Mars|conclusion|Colonizing Mars is not an enticing option.

8873| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|Many studies have found that emissions markets cost an economy less than regulatory approaches.
8874| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|A carbon tax is more economical than regulations.
8874| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|Numerous studies indicate that a carbon tax could achieve the same reductions in carbon emissions as emissions standards, but at a lower overall cost to the economy.
8875| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|Emissions standards are more stable than the carbon markets.
8875| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|Emissions trading markets can be unpredictable, as with any market.
8877| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|Carbon tax market mechanisms would be more effective in reducing carbon emissions.
8877| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|The theory behind carbon taxes is that it would cause higher energy prices, which would cause less consumption and emissions as well as providing incentives for greater fuel efficiency.
8879| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|Carbon emissions regulations and standards have proven an effective tool, and can be strengthened if necessary.
8879| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|It is unnecessary to attempt to implement market measures for cutting carbon emissions, when carbon regulation standards are effective and already in place.
8880| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|Command-and-control regulations do create costs that incentivize reductions in carbon emissions.
8880| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|With CAFE standards in the United States, for example, substantial fines were established for car manufacturers that produced inefficient cars.
8881| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|A carbon tax will not cause drivers to drive less.
8881| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|A carbon tax will not effect decisions such as driving to work every day.

8882| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|Exhaust and other emissions are much less harmful today than they were a decade ago, thanks to emission standards.
8883| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|Standards require old generating plants to update equipment.
8883| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|Market mechanisms do not explicitly require that firms update their equipment.
8885| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|It is fair to punish all carbon emissions with a carbon tax.
8885| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|Emitting carbon dioxide and other fossil fuel pollutants into the atmosphere is always bad because it is the cause of a global crisis called Global Warming.

8887| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|Many people have no choice but to consume energy, such as when they drive to work.
8888| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|"Emissions markets allow companies to buy the right to commit a social ""bad"" ."
8888| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|"Isn't all pollution ""bad"", particularly in the context of global warming? If so, it is wrong that a emissions trading system gives companies the ability to ""buy"" the right to pollute."
8889| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|conclusion|Emissions regulations and standards are a greater administrative burden.
8889| Market vs. regulatory approaches to cutting carbon emissions|premise|In general, regulations and standards require a greater degree of government monitoring and enforcement.

8895| Marriage|conclusion|Marriage allows a community to celebrate a couple's love.
8895| Marriage|premise|When two individuals love on another, it is important that they be able to include their friends, family, and larger community in a celebration of that love.
8896| Marriage|conclusion|It is fallacious to presume that marriage as an institution is what provides a stable home environment for a child.
8896| Marriage|premise|What is most important is the relationship between the two parents and their attitudes and relationships individually and together with the child.
8897| Marriage|conclusion|Marriage is still important in society as a rational view of what a loving committed relationship actually is.
8897| Marriage|premise|if love is so transient in society it is important to have a foundation to hold couples together to realise that friendship, support, trust and commitment are more important.

8902| Mass migration|conclusion|Contention that wealthy countries benefit most from migration , whereas poorer countries lose out.
8902| Mass migration|premise|Economic migrants leave their countries not because they cannot find jobs but mainly because they are seeking higher income.
8903| Mass migration|conclusion|Remittances benefit home economies.
8903| Mass migration|premise|The higher real wages that migrant workers earn abroad and transfer to their families at home can be compared to dividends from successful capital investments.
8904| Mass migration|conclusion|Often migrants move with their families, so there cannot be any income for a home country.
8904| Mass migration|premise|While the head of the family benefits a host country, his children and elderly parents become a burden on this country’s taxpayers.
8905| Mass migration|conclusion|International migration can bring new knowledge and technologies to some countries.
8905| Mass migration|premise|For instance, the huge migration from Europe to America in the late 19th century did boost the growth rate in the US, and contributed to its economic take-off.
8906| Mass migration|conclusion|Inflows of low-paid migrants lowers the need for outsourcing.
8906| Mass migration|premise|Outsourcing is largely driven by a demand to cut costs by paying workers less.
8907| Mass migration|conclusion|Immigrants are mainly of working age, which means they consume less of the services provided by the state, such as health care and education, and pay more in taxes.
8907| Mass migration|premise|In the UK, Home Office research suggests that immigrants pay 2.
8908| Mass migration|conclusion|The success of immigrants in boosting the American economy was only possible thanks to a huge internal free, liberal market there at the time, and the plentiful availability of cheap land.
8908| Mass migration|premise|However, since the 19th century economic realities in the world have changed a lot.
8909| Mass migration|conclusion|What is good for poor countries and the global economy is sound trading practice and investment in Less Developed Countries.

8911| Mass migration|conclusion|Unless borders are thrown open completely and total freedom of movement is allowed, there will always be attempts to enter countries illegally, with unpleasant consequences.
8911| Mass migration|premise|Better enforcement and stronger international cooperation could greatly reduce the extent of these problems, without giving up a reasonable policy which enjoys widespread public backing.
8912| Masturbation|conclusion|While masturbating, one cannot catch STDs.
8912| Masturbation|premise|While the sexual intercourse is definitely connected with not so slight chance of contracting a STD (sexually transmitted disease), it's virtually impossible to catch a STD, if only rudimentary hygiene is adhered to during the process of masturbation.

8999| McCain vs. Obama|conclusion|Iraq will not become a model democracy.
8999| McCain vs. Obama|premise|The democratic potential of Iraq is non-existent.

9031| Means testing for benefits|premise|Many countries are suffering from an ageing population.

9864| Network neutrality|conclusion|Net neutrality prevents discrimination between sites.
9864| Network neutrality|premise|"""On the Internet today, a Web site run by a solo blogger can load as quickly as any corporate home page."
9865| Network neutrality|conclusion|Network owners have a profit incentive to price discriminate.
9865| Network neutrality|premise|"""The large phone and cable companies who provide access to the Internet have the incentive and ability to create a special fast lane for big companies that can afford to pay steep tolls, while everyone else is left in a digital dirt road."
9866| Network neutrality|conclusion|Net neutrality properly separates Internet access and content.
9866| Network neutrality|premise|Network owners or Internet Service Providers are considered the gatekeepers of the Internet.

9877| Network neutrality|premise|We may see an Internet future not quite as bright as we need, with less investment, less innovation and more congestion.
9878| Network neutrality|conclusion|Net neutrality may not be good for ISPs, but good overall.
9878| Network neutrality|premise|It is not essential that network neutrality be good for Internet Service Providers, so long as it is judged good for the public and websites overall, and sufficiently tolerable for ISPs.
9879| Network neutrality|conclusion|Net neutrality provides legal consistency that is good for ISPs.
9879| Network neutrality|premise|By setting out clear rules about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable behavior, ISPs will avoid getting into trouble like Comcast did when it blocked BitTorrent users in early 2010.

9881| Network neutrality|premise|"""to bring about a utopian desire for virtually unlimited access over a limited resource, government would require broadband providers to operate in ways not necessarily in the best interest of the companies or their paying customers."
9882| Network neutrality|conclusion|Net neutrality will force ISPs to ask permission from FCC.
9882| Network neutrality|premise|Net neutrality rules will force network owners to constantly ask whether certain things they are doing are within FCC net neutrality non-discrimination regulations.

9905| New START Treaty|premise|"""The issue on the table is a nuclear arms reduction and verification treaty between the United States and Russia."
9906| New START Treaty|conclusion|Russia will build-up nuclear arms without New START.
9906| New START Treaty|premise|Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in an interview released in early December 2010 that Russia might be forced to build up its nuclear forces against the West if the United States fails to ratify the New START treaty.

9921| Non-interventionism|conclusion|IMF should not intervene.
9921| Non-interventionism|premise|There are many doubts whether IMF's instruments are quick and flexible enough for the full range of crises.
9922| Non-interventionism|conclusion|IMF is the best suited organization to dealing with crises.
9922| Non-interventionism|premise|Firstly, the International Monetary Fund imposes policy prescriptions only when critical to a programme's success, thus poses no political threat.
9923| Non-interventionism|conclusion|National sovereignty is of great importance.

9925| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind offers valuable measure of student progress.
9925| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|No Child Left Behind allows teachers to judge the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of their methods in their classes and with individual students.
9926| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Standardized testing sets useful baseline achievement standards.
9926| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|It is important that a nation has a general frame of reference on where students should, on average, be at various stages in their educational development.
9927| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Standardized tests poorly measure real student learning.
9927| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Standardized testing often tests only a very limited range of skills rather than the broad range of skills we would hope our educational system is teaching.
9928| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB testing wrongly assumes all children are the same.
9928| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Any system of standardized testing (in order to pass a class) assumes that all students progress at the same rate.
9929| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLF does not track progress of individual students.
9929| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""schools should be judged on whether each child progresses from one year to the next, which is called a 'growth model."
9930| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB has succeeded in improving test scores.
9930| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|NAEP) The Department of Education points to National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results, released in July 2005, showing improved student achievement in reading and math resulting from No Child Left Behind.
9931| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Standardized tests ensures students learn essential information.
9931| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|There is some information in the world that is essential to know as a means of communicating effectively and analytically with other individuals in society, whether as a citizen or in the marketplace.
9932| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Standardized test info is more essential than music and arts.
9932| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|While music and arts are important, in a globally competitive marketplace they are less important than more essential historical information, reading-comprehension, and math-skills.
9933| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB tests what is testable.
9933| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|While music, art, culture, and physical education are important, they are not testable.
9934| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Schools should teach test-information as well as arts etc.
9934| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""Teaching to the test."
9935| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Standards enables students to integrate well into new schools.
9935| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|The establishment of statewide standards, instead of city or neighborhood curricula, also benefits students who move between neighboring communities by increasing the odds that lessons learned in one school will generally line up sensibly with lessons taught at a new school for a student.
9936| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB encountered some problems due to low funding.
9936| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|No Child Left Behind had some significant problems when it was first implemented under the Bush administration.
9937| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind motivates unfortunate teaching to the test.
9937| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|The focus on standardized testing (all students in a state take the same test under the same conditions) as the means of assessment encourages teachers to teach a narrow subset of skills that will increase test performance rather than focus on deeper understanding and life lessons that can be applied in the marketplace, real life, and to citizenship and democracy generally.
9938| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind over-emphasizes math and reading.
9938| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""Congress should correct the legislation’s unintended consequences, which include reducing the amount of arts education in our nation’s schools."
9939| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind does not inspire a love of learning.
9939| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|The most important element in education is that students develop a love of learning, so that they seek to learn on their own, outside of school.
9940| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB raises standards and testing without improving education.
9940| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""."
9941| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No-Child-Left-Behind detracts from the education of the gifted.
9941| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|When the focus of the educational system and teachers is on the standardized average, this detracts from the education of those at the low and high end of educational achievement.
9942| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB gets teachers to over-focus on those just below passing.
9942| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Because No Child Left Behind makes passing tests such a central priority, teachers don't have much of an incentive to spend time helping those that are already likely to pass nor those that are highly unlikely to pass (it would be wasted energy).
9943| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind increases dropout rates.
9943| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"NCLB creates a perverse incentive for schools to encourage poor-performing students to dropout and leave (because it may be necessary for a school to avoid being labeled ""failing"")."
9944| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB testing helps reveal and change failing teaching methods.
9944| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|The focus of testing is to provide a clear indication teaching methods that are working and ones that are not.
9945| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind fosters accountability in public schools.
9945| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""NCLB proponents and critics alike agree that the law's greatest accomplishment has been shinning an unforgiving light on such languishing schools and demanding that they do better."
9946| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB has safeguards for schools that are failing despite proficiency.
9946| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"Gives school districts the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency, even for subgroups that do not meet State Minimum Achievement standards, through a process called ""safe harbor,"" a precursor to growth-based or value-added assessments."
9947| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind draws, keeps, motivates good teachers.
9947| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""Strengthening Teacher Quality  H."
9948| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB standardized tests are a poor measure of school performance.
9948| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""results on NAEP are dubious bases for reaching summary judgments regarding school quality."
9949| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind reveal nothing new about school performance.
9949| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""This law is not about discovering which schools need help; we already know."
9950| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Teachers are not necessarily to blame for poor student performance.
9950| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"Critics of the NCLB requirement for ""one high, challenging standard"" claim that some students are simply unable to perform at the level for their age, no matter how good the teacher is."
9951| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind does nothing to improve teachers.
9951| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""according to a recent 50-state survey by Teachers Network, a non-profit education organization, exactly 3% of teachers think NCLB helps them to teach more effectively."
9952| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB damages teacher morale, future of profession.
9952| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""It pushes classrooms toward relentless drilling, not something that inspires able people to become teachers or makes children eager to learn."
9953| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB sets overly restrictive qualifications for teaching.
9953| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|No Child Left Behind sets highly restrictive qualifications for teaching in schools.
9954| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB counter-productively punishes teachers/schools.
9954| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Punishing teachers for the poor performance of students fails to address the main issue; how to better or differently instruct students.
9955| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB ridgedly punishes schools that are progressing, albeit slowly.
9955| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Many schools are doing a great job and progressing, but are not progressing at the unreasonable pace set by NCLB.
9956| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Teachers want to be held accountable, just not to tests.
9956| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|While accountability is often considered important among teachers, it is important to consider what teachers are being held accountable for.
9957| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB causes the retention of students in grades to avoid tests.
9957| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Because schools and teachers are hyper-sensitive about passing students under NCLB testing, a perverse incentive is created to hold back underperforming students that should pass on to a higher grade simply to avoid the risk that they will take and fail a test.
9958| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB causes schools to turn-away most needy students.
9958| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"No Child Left Behind creates a perverse incentive for schools to deny entry to underperforming students as a means of decreasing the chances that the school will be labeled ""failing"" and sanctioned as a consequence."
9959| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB wrongly cuts funding to the most needy, under-performing schools.
9959| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Instead of helping lift-up underperforming schools, No Child Left Behind cuts resources to these schools as a means of punishment, counter-productively ensuring the continued failure of these schools.
9960| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB demands too much from schools with worst students, least funding.
9960| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|No Child Left Behind demands the most improvement from the schools with the least funding and the worst students.
9961| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Most teachers are honest and will not cheat the system under NCLB.
9961| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Teachers will probably not cheat the system, simply out of respect for themselves, their profession, and their students.
9962| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind motivates teachers to cheat.
9962| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|When teacher accountability is based on test scores, teachers are often motivated to cheat, by modifying student standardized tests so that more pass.
9963| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|NCLB ensures disabled students are not left behind.
9963| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"""The fact is that in many, many public schools, kids with disabilities are not learning to read and do math — while the vast majority of them can master these skills with proper instruction."
9964| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind subjects disabled to same test standards.
9964| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Because No Child Left Behind requires that 100% of students in a school are able to pass, disabled and special-ed students are often expected to pass the same exams as other students.
9965| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind offers choice to leave failing schools.
9965| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|If a school fails to meet AYP targets two or more years running, the school must offer eligible children the chance to transfer to higher-performing local schools, receive free tutoring, or attend after-school programs.
9966| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind encourages parents to engage more actively.
9966| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|No Child Left Behind establishes the foundation for schools and school districts to significantly enhance parental involvement and improve administration through the use of the assessment data to drive decisions on instruction, curriculum and business practices.
9967| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|School choice in NCLB will make bad schools worse.
9967| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|When students and parents have the choice to leave bad schools, they will often choose to do so.
9968| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|"Good not ""failing"" students students will leave under NCLB."
9968| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"No Child Left Behind is intended to provide resources to students that are ""failing"" to leave and be transported to other schools, where they may be more successful."
9969| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|"""Failing"" schools will not accept ""failing"" students."
9969| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"Underperforming children often have no choice to transfer from one school to another, when all schools are ""underperforming"" or ""failing"", in which case schools frequently deny underperforming students access - as a means of keeping up their school's test scores so as to avoid being labelled ""failing"" and punished."
9970| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Statewide standards are an improvement over major local failures.
9970| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Local failures have necessitated federal intervention to remedy issues like teachers teaching outside their areas of expertise, and complacency in the face of continually failing schools.

9980| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind lacks non-English tests.
9980| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Students who are learning English have an automatic three-year-long window to take assessments in their native language, after which they must generally demonstrate proficiency on an English language assessment.
9981| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|No Child Left Behind effectively penalizes diversity in schools.
9981| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|"Because diverse schools more frequently have statistically underperforming minority groups, non-native English speakers, or disabled groups, they are much more likely to ""fail"" and be penalized."
9982| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|There is nothing wrong with military recruiting.
9982| No Child Left Behind Act|premise|Military recruiting in schools is entirely appropriate.
9983| No Child Left Behind Act|conclusion|Facilitating military recruitment through NCLB is wrong.

10063| Nuclear energy|premise|It is the job of leaders and diplomats to reduce the risk of the nefarious use of any technology.
10064| Nuclear energy|conclusion|Nuclear energy can reduce materials available for weapons-use.
10064| Nuclear energy|premise|The Megatons-to-Megawatts program destroyed weapons material by using it to create electricity in power stations across the US.
10065| Nuclear energy|conclusion|Nuclear energy risks being diverted to nuclear weapons development.
10065| Nuclear energy|premise|"""Sensitive nuclear technology such as uranium enrichment and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing are ostensibly employed to create fuel in power reactors, they may be easily adjusted or redirected to produce weapons-grade fissile material."
10066| Nuclear energy|conclusion|The benefits of nuclear energy are outweighed by weapons-use risks.
10066| Nuclear energy|premise|"""Moore turns to the question of whether nuclear power can be diverted to make nuclear weapons, and to his credit calls it 'the most serious issue associated with nuclear energy."
10067| Nuclear energy|conclusion|Populations surrounding nuclear power plants approve of them.
10067| Nuclear energy|premise|"""Eighty percent of the people living within 10 miles of these plants approve of them (that's not including the nuclear workers)."

10188| Outsourcing|premise|Offshoring involves a focus on cost at the expense of all else.

10193| Outsourcing|conclusion|Outsourcing may be a characteristic of a new stage in the global economy.

10208| Palestinian right of return|premise|"According to Alexander Safian, Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees a right to return ""to his own country""."
10209| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|More of a right to leave than right to return.
10209| Palestinian right of return|premise|"According to Alexander Safian, Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not guarantee a right of return because the clause ""everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country"" was meant to guarantee the right to leave."
10210| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Jews expelled from Arab countries have no right of return.
10210| Palestinian right of return|premise|"Some critics of the Palestinian ""right of return"" also argue that it is not supported by international precedent, drawing attention to the 758,000-866,000 Jews were expelled, fled or emigrated from the Arab Middle East and North Africa between 1945 and 1956, with property losses of $1 billion."
10211| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Palestinians maybe should be allowed to return, but have no right.

10213| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Denationalization of Palestinians illegal.
10213| Palestinian right of return|premise|Although the status of Palestinian nationals/citizens after the creation of the State of Israel has been much debated, established principles of state succession, human rights and humanitarian law confirm that the denationalization of Palestinians was illegal and that they retain the right to return to their places of origin.
10214| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Israel has consistently dehumanized Palestinians and their rights.
10214| Palestinian right of return|premise|Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983.
10215| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|No formal international legal right of return for Palestinians.
10215| Palestinian right of return|premise|There is no formal mechanism in international law to demand repatriation of refugees and their descendants in general, or Palestinians specifically.
10216| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Arab countries, not Israel, keep Palestinians in state of limbo.
10216| Palestinian right of return|premise|It is the failure of Arab states to incorporate Palestinians into their societies by offering legal status (with the exception of Jordan) which keeps the Palestinian refugees in their current limbo, not Israeli policy.
10217| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Right of return is individual, not group, right .
10217| Palestinian right of return|premise|On March 15, 2000, a group of 100 prominent Palestinians from around the world expressed their opinion that the right of return is individual, rather than collective, and that it cannot therefore be reduced or forfeited by any representation on behalf of the Palestinians in any agreement or treaty.
10218| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Right of return is individual right, not collective for Palestinians.

10219| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Unjust for Jews to be able to emigrate, but not Palestinians return.
10219| Palestinian right of return|premise|a massive injustice the fact that Jews are allowed to emigrate to Israel under Israel's Law of Return, even if their immediate ancestors have not lived in the area in recent years, while people who grew up in the area and whose immediate ancestors had lived there for many generations are forbidden from returning.
10220| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Denying right of return is a prejudiced Zionist objective.
10220| Palestinian right of return|premise|"""Theodor Herzl, who presided the 1st ZC, had provided the ideological underpinnings of the Zionist movement in his pa pamphlet, Der Judenstaat, which was published in 1896."
10221| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Right of return would make Jews minority in Israel.
10221| Palestinian right of return|premise|Some opponents argue that if all or a large majority of Palestinian refugees and their descendants were to implement a 'right of return', it would make Arabs the majority within Israel and Jews an ethnic minority.
10222| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Right of return undermines idea of Israel as Jewish state.
10222| Palestinian right of return|premise|The majority of Israelis find a literal right of return for Palestinian refugees to be unacceptable, pointing out that allowing such an influx of Palestinians would eventually cause Israel's Jewish population to become a minority, thus undermining Israel's status as a Jewish state.
10223| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Right of return would result in mass of unworkable legal claims.
10223| Palestinian right of return|premise|"A right of return would result in a flood of Palestinians stating their ""right of return"" as justification for entering Israel at any time and in unlimited numbers and laying claim to old homes."
10224| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|A right of return wrongly makes Israel responsible for refugees.
10224| Palestinian right of return|premise|"Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in 2007: ""I will not agree to accept any kind of Israeli responsibility for the refugees."
10225| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Unlimited right of return goes a step too far.
10225| Palestinian right of return|premise|There are many things that Israel can and has offered to Palestinian refugees: compensation, assistance in resettlement, and return for an extremely limited number of refugees based solely on family reunification or humanitarian considerations.
10226| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Palestinians forced out, did not leave on own will.
10226| Palestinian right of return|premise|The traditional Israeli point of view arguing that Arab leaders encouraged Palestinian Arabs to flee has also been disputed Palestinians, who have presented evidence indicating Arab leaders' will for the Palestinian Arab population to stay put.
10227| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Arabs instigated 1948/1967 wars.
10227| Palestinian right of return|premise|Israeli official sources, foreign press, and officials present at the time, and historians such as Joseph Schechtman have long claimed that the 1948 refugee crisis was instigated by the invading Arab armies, who ordered Palestinian civilians to evacuate the battle zone.
10228| Palestinian right of return|conclusion|Palestinian flight from Israel was voluntary, not forced.
10228| Palestinian right of return|premise|According to some sources, Palestinian flight from Israel was not compelled but was predominantly voluntary, as a result of seven Arab nations declaring war on Israel in 1948.
10246| Partial-birth abortion|conclusion|The standard process of partial birth abortion is an unnecessarily violent process.
10246| Partial-birth abortion|premise|that breaks from the normative treatment of life forms.
10247| Partial-birth abortion|conclusion|An analogy could be appropriately drawn to the methods for conducting capital punishment.
10247| Partial-birth abortion|premise|While some societies believe that capital punishment is justified, they usually set very specific guidelines for the conduct of the process.
10248| Partial-birth abortion|conclusion|The fetus can feel pain, thus making the processes used in partial birth abortion barbarous.
10248| Partial-birth abortion|premise|There is little doubt among doctors and others that the fetus experiences pain during a partial birth abortion procedure.
10249| Partial-birth abortion|conclusion|The infant's rights begin only after the fetus is removed from the mother's body and its umbilical cord cut.
10249| Partial-birth abortion|premise|Nobody would choose to have a partial-birth abortion over a much simpler abortion in the first trimester.
10250| Partial-birth abortion|conclusion|"The collapsing of the skull of the ""partially born"" fetus is necessary to prevent pain and the risk of damage to the woman."
10250| Partial-birth abortion|premise|The head is the largest single part of a fetus, and is the most difficult to pass.
10251| Partial-birth abortion|conclusion|"A ban on partial birth abortions would stop other even more ""gruesome"" forms of late term abortions."
10251| Partial-birth abortion|premise|The primary alternative to partial birth abortion is the dismemberment and removal, in parts (legs, arms, head, torso), of an unborn fetus while inside the mother's womb.
10289| Partitioning Iraq|conclusion|A partition plan would reduce the need to protect against opposing groups, reducing the incentive for violence.
10289| Partitioning Iraq|premise|Sectarian militias have formed within areas with mixed sectarian groups, often with the intention of protecting their sectarian group from the opposing group.
10290| Partitioning Iraq|conclusion|Iraq's history as a united country has resulted only in violence and demanded hard-handed governance, and partitioning it would solve this problem.
10290| Partitioning Iraq|premise|"""Looking at Iraq's dismal history since Britain cobbled it together from three Ottoman provinces at the end of the first world war, it should be apparent that it is the effort to hold Iraq together that has been destabilizing."
10291| Partitioning Iraq|conclusion|Regional and local government and security apparatuses would be unable to maintain order following a partitioning of Iraq.
10291| Partitioning Iraq|premise|"""With the exception of the Kurdish regional government, the institutions of local governance, including regional councils, regional assemblies and the local police forces, are underdeveloped and fragmented, with little capacity to preserve the rule of law or deliver services."
10292| Partitioning Iraq|conclusion|The partitioning of Iraq would simply formalize the sectarian separations that are occurring more and more on the ground now.
10292| Partitioning Iraq|premise|Some have argued that Iraq cannot or should not be partitioned because there is too much integration between the sectarian groups there.
10293| Partitioning Iraq|conclusion|The intermixing of sectarian groups in Iraq would lead to ethnic cleansing during any partitioning of the country.

10603| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Some delegates are not obligated to vote according to popular will.
10603| Primaries in US elections|premise|This is undemocratic.
10604| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Superdelegates are not bound to represent the electorate.
10604| Primaries in US elections|premise|"In the past, ""Super Delegates"" have been a way for the Democratic party to secure a candidate at their convention."
10605| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|The primary system pushes elections back in the calendar.
10605| Primaries in US elections|premise|"This is a phenomenon known as by some as ""front loading"", in which different states desire to be earlier in the primary process to have a greater impact, thus causing a leap frogging effect backward in the calendar year."
10606| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|"""Frontloading"" shifts attention only to the earliest primaries and in this disrupting a real participatory democracy."
10606| Primaries in US elections|premise|"Studies have confirmed that the ""New Hampshire effect"" translates to a shift in focus to the early primaries."
10607| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Complicated US primaries lead to misleading vote counts.
10607| Primaries in US elections|premise|News media often reports the popular vote in primaries simply because it is easier to explain.
10608| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Primary elections distribute power unequally among voters.
10608| Primaries in US elections|premise|Instead of giving states delegates based on population, electoral college, or strength of the party in that state, the parties have a formula involving several other factors.
10609| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|The complicated primary system creates confusion and turns voters off.
10609| Primaries in US elections|premise|Every state has a different primary system.
10610| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Complicated primary elections create confusion abroad.
10610| Primaries in US elections|premise|The US presidential elections are a globally important phenomena, but foreigners struggle to follow the process.
10611| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Primaries create pride in unique local systems.
10611| Primaries in US elections|premise|While the primary system is complicated, this complication also produces pride within states and at precinct levels in the uniqueness of their particular process.
10613| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Primary election delegates are not distributed fairly between states.
10613| Primaries in US elections|premise|National party organizations do not assign delegates on the basis of population, but through a convoluted mix of political considerations.
10614| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|US primary elections help strengthen political parties.
10614| Primaries in US elections|premise|The interests of state party organizations, such as the Tennessee Democratic Party, are important to consider in addition to the interests of the umbrella party organization (Democratic Party, Republican Party).
10616| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|"Well organized conventions have always been ""coronation"" events."
10616| Primaries in US elections|premise|Conventions only degenerate into arguments when the party concerned has been in trouble, as at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago that saw street fighting between students and the police as the convention selected Vice-President Humphrey.
10617| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Primary elections give too much power to party bosses.
10617| Primaries in US elections|premise|Because political parties control primary elections, party bosses are given substantial power and authority in making decisions that lead to the election of the next president.
10618| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|An unrepresentative primary system damages the party strength.
10618| Primaries in US elections|premise|If people feel that they are disenfranchised by the primary system, they are much less likely to vote and to generally participate in politics in the party that they affiliate with.
10619| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|The primary process reduces the level of debate at national conventions.
10619| Primaries in US elections|premise|Traditionally, the conventions were sources of ideological and policymaking debate for organisations – both Republican and Democrat – that are far less pan-national than their European counterparts (especially when the party concerned is out of power).
10620| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Iowa and New Hampshire are ideal states to start the primaries.
10620| Primaries in US elections|premise|Because Iowa and New Hampshire are small, they are the least likely to immediately decide the outcome of an election.
10621| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Iowa and New Hampshire voters are diligent examiners.
10621| Primaries in US elections|premise|These voters are particularly noteworthy for the way they pick apart and scrutinize candidates.
10622| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Iowa and New Hampshire are not socially or culturally representative of the U.S.
10622| Primaries in US elections|premise|New Hampshire also does not remotely represent the vast diversity of this country's racial, cultural and ideological background, according to the Census Bureau.
10623| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Early emphasis on Iowa and New Hampshire disenfranchises minority voters.
10623| Primaries in US elections|premise|For minority voters, the current system is a disaster.
10624| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Alternatives such as the Delaware Plan would help all candidates and encourage public engagement.
10624| Primaries in US elections|premise|By allowing less populated states to start to vote and having the most populated to go last the alternative promotes better democratic participation as the winner of the party nomination cannot be yet established until all states have voted.
10625| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|“Backloading” of the primary schedule can help reduce the special interest effect contained in all “big money ‘ campaigns.
10625| Primaries in US elections|premise|The specific alternative model of allowing small states to go first provides a chance for particular candidates to start a campaign in smaller states with fewer funds.
10626| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Rotating regional primaries solve the problems of the current process.
10626| Primaries in US elections|premise|This would break the country into four regions, with the states in each region holding their primaries simultaneously on the first Tuesday of March, April, May, and June.
10627| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Primaries help parties define their agendas.
10627| Primaries in US elections|premise|US primaries are not simply about people voting for a person they want to become president.
10628| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Primary elections give unfair advantage to incumbent candidates.
10628| Primaries in US elections|premise|By making rival opposition candidates attack one another, using up their campaign funds and destroying their reputations, the primaries favour an incumbent president, who is sure of nomination and can wait until the election proper before unleashing his funds – which are normally higher than the challenger’s, even without the depletion of the challenger's funds through the primaries.
10629| Primaries in US elections|conclusion|Primaries are an enormous and unproductive use of money.
10629| Primaries in US elections|premise|"The US presidential presidential primaries are a particularly long process, getting longer ever year in part due to what is known as ""frontloading""."
10630| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Allowing prisoner voting respects democratic practices.
10630| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"Even governments can choose to rule that prisoners forfeit their right to vote or deserve the punishment of being deprived their vote, we should ask, ""what's the higher road?""."
10631| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Depriving prisoners a vote wrongly disenfranchises them.
10631| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"The Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the infringement of prisoner voting rights did not meet the test for what's considered ""reasonable."
10632| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners should have very right to make a decision based on their own morals .
10632| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Part of the freedom of this country is the freedom to choose based on personal moral ethics.
10633| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoner voting cheapens votes of citizens.
10633| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"Canadian Alliance MP Vic Toews said that the 2002 Canadian Supreme Court decision in favor of prisoner voting ""cheapens everyone's vote."
10634| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoner voting would demean the entire electoral system.
10634| Prisoners right to vote|premise|The electoral system is based on a society's collective sense of respect for the law, citizenship, and democratic processes.
10635| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoner voting would undermine the public's sense of justice.
10635| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"UK attorney general Dominic Grieve said: ""If convicted rapists and murderers are given the vote it will bring the law into disrepute and many people will see it as making a mockery of justice""."
10636| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Felons have bad judgement, should not help elect reps.
10636| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Tucker Carlson, MSNBC News Commentator.
10637| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners retain many rights, including the right to vote.
10637| Prisoners right to vote|premise|We should respect their human rights and should infringe upon their liberty as little as possible, except for the protection of the public.
10638| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners have a right to express interests through voting.
10638| Prisoners right to vote|premise|The needs of prisoners are currently not represented.
10639| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners must be able to influence world they will re-enter.
10639| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Prisoners should also have the opportunity to influence the formation of policy on healthcare, education, the environment and all the other issues that affect the world into which almost all of them will some day be released.
10640| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|There is no state interest in denying prisoners a vote.
10640| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Depriving a citizen of a right requires a compelling state interest.
10641| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|We cannot assume that they do not wish to vote.
10641| Prisoners right to vote|premise|While many prisoners may not wish to vote we cannot assume this goes for the entire prisoner population.
10642| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Voting is a privilege  that criminals fairly lose.
10642| Prisoners right to vote|premise|The clearest indication that voting is a privilege and not a right is the fact that minors cannot vote.
10643| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|If minors have no right to vote neither should prisoners.
10643| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Not all citizens have the right to vote.
10644| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Only qualified citizens have a right to vote.
10644| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Alexander v Mineta, U.
10645| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Criminals forfeit the right to vote.
10645| Prisoners right to vote|premise|When a citizen breaks the laws of the state, they forfeit many of the rights and protections of the state, including the right to vote.
10646| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners are unfit for society so unfit to vote.
10646| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"UK Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe said in 2001, ""The courts have ruled that convicted prisoners, many of them dangerous, cannot be allowed to take part in normal society."
10648| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Most prisoners don't care about voting.
10648| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"""I can offer some well-informed guesses about how my old cellmates in HMP Belmarsh might react to the news that their Christmas present from Brussels is to be a new right to put their crosses on ballot papers from behind bars."
10649| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners’ interests are represented by NGOs and others.
10649| Prisoners right to vote|premise|These entities ensure that prisoners are not ill-treated.
10650| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners deserve voting privileges only when they act responsibly.
10650| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Prisoners can only be given the rights of members of society when they are deemed capable of acting as responsible members of society.
10651| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Depriving prisoners a vote continues legacy of disenfranchisement.
10651| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"""Last month, the New York State Assembly unanimously passed a bill expressing regret for New York’s role in the slave trade."
10652| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|"Depriving prisoner vote ""disenfranchises"" only because more minorities are felons."
10652| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Edward Feser, Ph.
10653| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Depriving prisoners their vote exceeds judge's punishment.
10653| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"""As part of their citizenship, convicted persons in detention should be entitled to vote."
10654| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|A right to vote hardly diminishes a prisoner's sentence.
10654| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Even with the right to vote, more fundamental freedoms would continue to be deprived from a prisoner (most importantly, their physical freedom of movement).
10655| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Depriving prisoners of a vote is simply mean spirited.
10655| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Surely, we should punish criminals.
10656| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners are rightly punished by denying their vote.
10656| Prisoners right to vote|premise|They are shut away not only to protect society, but also to symbolise society’s disgust at their acts.
10657| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoner voting offers dignity, aids rehabilitation.
10657| Prisoners right to vote|premise|This is essential if they are to avoid re-offending after being released.
10658| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Rehabilitation is main goal .
10658| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Rehabilitation is the main goal in the prison systems of modern, liberal democracies.
10659| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Voting offers prisoners a sense of citizenship, reintegration.
10659| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Voting encourages prisoners to take an interest in current affairs, which will aid their reintegration into society.
10660| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoner voting undermines punishment and so rehabilitation.
10660| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Rehabilitation should focus upon making prisoners realise and sincerely regret the effects of their actions.
10661| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|The state is hypocritical in taxing prisoners but not giving them a vote.
10661| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Prisoners are not treated as “civically dead” when it benefits the State: they are liable for taxation on any earnings and savings that they have.
10662| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|The right to vote does not follow from the obligation to pay taxes.
10662| Prisoners right to vote|premise|In many countries, people start earning money and paying tax before they are old enough to vote (particularly if they leave school as soon as they are allowed to do so).
10663| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Denying prisoners the right to vote does not protect the public.
10663| Prisoners right to vote|premise|It is, therefore, an unwarranted infringement upon the human rights of prisoners.
10664| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Criminals, dangerous to society, are dangerous with vote.
10664| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"UK Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe said in 2001, ""The courts have ruled that convicted prisoners, many of them dangerous, cannot be allowed to take part in normal society."
10665| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prospect of losing voting rights does not deter crime.
10665| Prisoners right to vote|premise|People are deterred from committing crimes by the prospects of their movement being restricted and of being separated from loved ones.
10666| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Denying felons a vote sends a strong message, deters crime.
10666| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Banning prisoners from voting is one part of a package of measures that exclude prisoners from normal society, the most obvious of which are restrictions on movement, communication and employment.
10667| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Linking a ban on voting to imprisonment is arbitrary.
10667| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Many people who commit serious crimes are not sent to prison, because of their age, the effects upon their dependents or the likelihood that they will not re-offend.
10668| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|This is not an argument for letting all, or indeed any, prisoners vote.
10668| Prisoners right to vote|premise|The imposition of a prison sentence is a good general index of the seriousness of a crime, and those who have committed serious crimes should suffer “civic death”.
10669| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Prisoners are still citizens.
10669| Prisoners right to vote|premise|It is common fact among government that the right to vote belongs to all legal aged citizens.
10670| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|14th amendment permits denying voting rights to criminals.
10670| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Alex Kozinski, J.
10671| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Equal protection clause does not protect prisoner votes.
10671| Prisoners right to vote|premise|Alexander v Mineta, U.
10673| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|Most liberal democracies extend voting rights to prisoners.
10673| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"""The United States has the worst record in the democratic world when it comes to stripping convicted felons of the right to vote."
10674| Prisoners right to vote|conclusion|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights supports prisoner voting.
10674| Prisoners right to vote|premise|"""Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, part of which provides that every citizen shall have the right to vote at elections under universal suffrage without a distinction of any kind on the basis of race, sex, etc or other status."
10675| Privatisation of the State|conclusion|Increased purchasing power and standards of living.
10675| Privatisation of the State|premise|Generally, a more competitive and productive economy leads to cheaper goods for the consumer.
10677| Privatisation of the State|conclusion|Maintaining current levels of spending is, given an aging population , unsustainable.
10677| Privatisation of the State|premise|Smaller government is better government, providing a framework for encouraging investment rather than micro-managing daily problems.
10678| Privatisation of the State|conclusion|Privatisation does not always remove government interference.
10678| Privatisation of the State|premise|Regulation of industries to maintain standards of safety and quality are more often used than true competition.
10679| Privatisation of the State|conclusion|The rights of workers and quality of goods, even within the private market, are protected by the rule of law.
10679| Privatisation of the State|premise|It is true that where this is lacking, free markets might not work (e.
10680| Privatisation of the State|conclusion|Private companies rarely protect the safety and standards of their workforce as well as nationalised industries do.
10680| Privatisation of the State|premise|Workers are paid less for longer hours, and their jobs, pay and pensions are dependent on market fluctuations.
10687| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatizing social security enables investment of savings.
10687| Privatizing social security|premise|"""If Social Security were privatized, people would deposit their income with a bank."
10688| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Private accounts increase investments, jobs, wages.
10688| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Finally, Social Security drains capital from the poorest areas of the country, leaving less money available for new investment and job creation."
10689| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Private accounts prevent politicians taking from social security.
10689| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Fiscal conservative candidates should embrace it."
10690| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Social security is net loss for taxpayers and beneficiaries.
10690| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Social Security represents a bad deal for postwar Americans."
10691| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Costly privatization of Soc Sec would dampen econ growth.
10691| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Reason #3: creating private accounts could dampen economic growth, which would further weaken social security's future finances."
10692| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatization would not increase capital for investment.
10692| Privatizing social security|premise|"""And that fact makes clear the fallacy of the next argument often proffered by privatization supporters: They claim that the flow of dollars into the private accounts and then into the equity markets will stimulate the economy."
10693| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatization during economic crisis would have been disaster.
10693| Privatizing social security|premise|Privatization in the midst of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression would have caused households to have lost even more of their assets, had their investments been invested in the U.
10694| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatizing social security would wrongly enrich banks.
10694| Privatizing social security|premise|Privatization would represent a windfall for Wall Street financial institutions, who would obtain significant fees for managing private accounts.
10695| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatization would hasten depletion of Soc Sec trust funds.
10695| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Diverting up to four percentage points of the payroll tax to create private accounts as the president has proposed would shorten significantly the time until the Trust Funds become depleted."
10696| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatization does not address long-term funding challenges.
10696| Privatizing social security|premise|"The program is ""pay as you go"", meaning current payroll taxes pay for current retirees."
10697| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Private accounts provide retirees a higher rate of return.
10697| Privatizing social security|premise|"""privatization would provide retirees with a much higher rate of return on their investments."
10698| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatization gives investment decisions to account holders.
10698| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Additionally, the scare tactics of Feingold make it sound like the Social Security money those under 55 invest would have to go to Wall Street."
10699| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Social security taxes damage ability of poor to survive.
10699| Privatizing social security|premise|Americans living at the poverty level must usually spend every cent of their disposable income just to survive.
10700| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatizing social security helps the poor.
10700| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Critics of Social Security privatization often warn that such proposals hold serious dangers for the elderly poor."
10701| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Odds against individuals investing retirement accounts wisely.
10701| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Reason #5: The odds are against individuals investing successfully."
10702| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatized social security accounts vulnerable to downturns.
10702| Privatizing social security|premise|Most stock market experts will point out that the long-term return on stocks has always been positive, despite temporary setbacks now and then.
10703| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Advocates of privatization overestimate performance of accounts.
10703| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Furthermore, as Paul Krugman has pointed out, the would-be privatizers make incredible—even impossible—assumptions about the likely performance of the market to justify their claim that private accounts would outdo the current system."
10704| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatized social security will cut tax revenues and social services.
10704| Privatizing social security|premise|We all know that the social security system is severely underfunded; it's headed for bankruptcy sometime in the 2040s.
10705| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatized social security cannot be assured to beat inflation.
10705| Privatizing social security|premise|Social Security payouts are indexed to wages, which historically have exceeded inflation.
10706| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatized social security restores individual liberty and ownership.
10706| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Voters are tired of big government."
10707| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatizing social security offers ownership in economy.
10707| Privatizing social security|premise|"""An important side benefit of Social Security privatization is that it would give every American--including poor Americans--an opportunity to participate in the economy by owning a part of it."
10708| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Private accounts can be transferred within family.
10708| Privatizing social security|premise|"""These accounts would also be personal assets, much like a house or a 401k account."
10709| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Conservatives want to destroy social security because it works.
10709| Privatizing social security|premise|"""For Social Security is a government program that works, a demonstration that a modest amount of taxing and spending can make people's lives better and more secure."
10710| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Private accounts would require costly new govt bureaucracy.
10710| Privatizing social security|premise|"""REASON #8: PRIVATE ACCOUNTS WOULD REQUIRE A NEW GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY."
10711| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Social Security allows retirees to draw on own investments.
10711| Privatizing social security|premise|"""And those ""baby boomers"" who are going to bust Social Security when the retire? They have been paying into the system for more than 40 years, generating the large surplus the program has accumulated."
10719| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Private social security accounts are voluntary.
10719| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Democrats will say supporters of personal accounts will allow people's fragile retirement plans to be subjected to the whims of the stock market, but that's just more demagoguery."
10720| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Privatization of Soc Sec has disappointed in most places.
10720| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Reason #4: privatization has been a disappointment elsewhere."
10721| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Public supports private social security accounts.
10721| Privatizing social security|premise|"""Not surprisingly, this is an attractive idea."
10722| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Americans support increasing taxes to fund Social Security.
10722| Privatizing social security|premise|"""the American people, despite voting for Republicans, have said over and over in polls that they would pay more in taxes to save entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare."
10723| Privatizing social security|conclusion|Support for privatization is driven by misinformation.
10723| Privatizing social security|premise|"""There can be little doubt, at least among those who view the issue objectively, that it is purely iIdeology (or misinformation), not economics, that generates the enthusiasm for privatization."
10724| Profit-driven society|conclusion|Environment and economy is not a zero-sum game.
10724| Profit-driven society|premise|As companies and individuals are concerned about their current financial profit, they are effectively harming our environment.
10725| Profit-driven society|conclusion|Working is usually very social.
10725| Profit-driven society|premise|While there are jobs which are lonely, most of the professions today includes great deal of social interaction, so the notion that working (for profit) reduces social life is fallacious.
10726| Profit-driven society|conclusion|Social life is more important than money.
10726| Profit-driven society|premise|What we are constantly forgetting is the fact that living in poverty is difficult, but living in a rush for possessions is not only exhausting, but also quite complicated.
10729| Progressive tax system|conclusion|Redistribution of income is unjust.
10729| Progressive tax system|premise|Why should we punish educated, hard-working, successful people with high salaries by imposing extra taxes on them? Besides, redistribution of income rewards not only the poorest of the poor, but also lazy slackers who shirk constantly and enjoy social welfare for nothing.
10730| Progressive tax system|conclusion|Redistribution of income gives wrong incentives.
10730| Progressive tax system|premise|Taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor shows disrespect for education and hard work, which demotivates successful people, as their work is not being rewarded.
10731| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive taxation makes all citizens sacrifice equally.
10731| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|"John Stuart Mill wrote in 1848: ""As a government out to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strengths of their claims on it, whatever sacrifices it requires from them should be made to bear as nearly as possible with the same pressure upon all."
10732| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive taxation affords individuals equal opportunity.
10732| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|One idea behind progressive taxation is to level the playing field so that the wealthy don't hold an iron-grasp of economic opportunity.
10733| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive taxes violate principal of equality before the law.
10733| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|"""A progressive income tax violates the very heart and soul of the Framer's Constitution of liberty."
10734| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive taxation wrongly aims for equality of outcome.
10734| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|Progressive tax systems wrongly aim to combat inequality in people's circumstances, aiming to produce greater equality of outcome.
10735| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive taxes are not socialism or spreading the wealth.
10735| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|"""Conceptually there is a major difference between progressive taxation and ""spreading the wealth"" socialism."
10736| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive tax systems recognize income is partly a collective good.
10736| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|"""Wealth is a privilege for which the state is largely to thank."
10737| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive taxation is socialist wealth redistribution and state theft.
10737| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|"""I am certain that most people would agree that stealing would not be considered a moral act, even if what was stolen was given to someone who needed it more than its original owner."
10738| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Capital is created on assumption of ownership.
10738| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|Capital is created in the first place only via the assumption made by individuals that they can create and own that capital.
10739| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|conclusion|Progressive taxation exceeds limited powers of government.
10739| Progressive tax vs. flat tax|premise|"""how can taxes be collected in a moral manner?

10883| Prostitution|premise|There is no biblical basis for the anti-sexual traditions taught by tradition bound Christian Churches.
10884| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution is no more immoral than a one night stand.
10884| Prostitution|premise|While sex at it's best is about love and a true connection between two people, humans regularly engage in casual sex for the sheer physical pleasure.
10885| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution is morally wrong.
10885| Prostitution|premise|Sex is a special act, in some senses a sacred act.
10886| Prostitution|conclusion|Legal prostitution fosters a culture of woman-hating and rape.
10886| Prostitution|premise|Prostitutes are the brunt of many jokes among men, who view women as commodities to be exploited.
10887| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution contributes to adultery, breaks-up families.
10887| Prostitution|premise|Considering that the majority of men who visits prostitutes are married, this should be considered as morally wrong.
10888| Prostitution|conclusion|Individuals should be able to charge for sex, as it can be freely dispensed.
10888| Prostitution|premise|If sex is not in itself illegal, and can be freely dispensed (and is frequently without regard to any deeper meaning behind it), why is it wrong for a woman to charge for this.
10889| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution simply combines sex and free markets, both legal.
10889| Prostitution|premise|Sex is not illegal.
10890| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitutes freely choose their profession.
10890| Prostitution|premise|The majority of prostitutes freely choose their profession.
10891| Prostitution|conclusion|Governments should not set moral standards on prostitution.
10891| Prostitution|premise|Alison J.
10892| Prostitution|conclusion|Question of choice, in prostitution, is different for each person.
10892| Prostitution|premise|While it is true some women are coerced into prostitution, that holds no bearing on the women who did choose.
10893| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitutes do not have a genuine choice.
10893| Prostitution|premise|They are often encouraged to work in prostitution before they are old enough to make a reasoned decision.
10894| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution driven by a non-voluntary patriarchal culture.
10894| Prostitution|premise|"The ""choice"" to be a prostitute is anchored in this culture and can never be free of it."
10895| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution's destructiveness outweighs upholding freedoms.
10895| Prostitution|premise|Presently, prostitution is overwhelmingly characterized by and directly contributes to human trafficking, oppression, economic coercion and other forms of abuse rather than the affirmation of personal freedom and self-determination.
10896| Prostitution|conclusion|Individuals must cede some rights for safety, including right to prostitute.
10896| Prostitution|premise|In a democratic society, each individual cedes some rights to the government under the promise that the government will protect them from danger.
10897| Prostitution|conclusion|Justness of free markets and sex do not justify prostitution.
10897| Prostitution|premise|Although we admit that the free market and having a sex are not illegal on their own, prostitution does equal the combination of the two.
10898| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitutes are vulnerable because they lack labor protections.
10898| Prostitution|premise|By legalizing prostitution, a government can help bring these laborers under labor protections offered to other workers.
10899| Prostitution|conclusion|Legalization is merely a step in reducing sex industry abuses.
10899| Prostitution|premise|Legalization won't cure all of the abuses involved in the sex industry.
10900| Prostitution|conclusion|Criminalizing the sex industry fosters black market conditions for abuse.
10900| Prostitution|premise|When an industry is criminalized, and yet demand persists, blackmarkets frequently emerge.
10901| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution can relieve the tension that leads to sex crimes.
10901| Prostitution|premise|Sex crimes such as rape or molestation can be seen, in part, as a product of sexual frustrations.
10902| Prostitution|conclusion|Legalization of prostitution would disrupt the corruption of ‘pimps’.
10902| Prostitution|premise|These individuals subject prostitutes to physical abuse and threats of violence, retain a portion of their earnings, and often encourage them to become addicted to drugs.
10903| Prostitution|conclusion|Violence against prostitutes is a rampant problems.
10903| Prostitution|premise|The number of violent attacks on prostitutes, including rape and murder, and the considerably greater number of such crimes which are believed to go unreported, suggests that prostitutes themselves are the victims of the most serious criminal offences.
10904| Prostitution|conclusion|"Legalization does not ensure that prostitutes won't continue to work with ""pimps""."
10904| Prostitution|premise|The legalization of the ‘Bunny Ranch’ in Nevada did not prevent the majority of prostitutes from continuing to work outside of the licensed brothel, and remain dependent on pimps.
10910| Prostitution|conclusion|The legalization of prostitution will decrease instances of rape.
10910| Prostitution|premise|Numerous empirical studies find that legalization of prostitution decreases instances of rape.
10911| Prostitution|conclusion|Legal prostitution increases rates of rape.
10911| Prostitution|premise|Prostitution is an industry inherently vulnerable to rape.
10912| Prostitution|conclusion|Legalized prostitution sanctions a dangerous environment for women.
10912| Prostitution|premise|Governments should not sanction prostitution, as it is an industry with inherent risks to women.
10913| Prostitution|conclusion|Legalization won't reduce rape, as prostitution is itself a form of rape.
10913| Prostitution|premise|Prostitution is a form of rape.
10914| Prostitution|conclusion|Legalization would improve the sexual health of prostitutes and their clients.
10914| Prostitution|premise|The activity occurs in a clean and safe environment rather than on the street.
10915| Prostitution|conclusion|Legalization will increase prostitution and subsequently worsen public health.
10915| Prostitution|premise|When prostitution is lawful and increasingly regarded as socially acceptable, a greater number of people will use prostitutes.
10916| Prostitution|conclusion|It is impossible to ban prostitution.
10916| Prostitution|premise|Granted that prostitution has been present in societies across the world for thousands of years, governments should recognise that it cannot be eradicated.
10917| Prostitution|conclusion|Governments must protect the moral and physical health of citizens from prostitution.
10917| Prostitution|premise|Initiating the legalisation of prostitution would grant implicit approval to a dangerous and immoral practice.
10918| Prostitution|conclusion|Merely because some individuals break a law does not mean that the law itself is at fault.
10918| Prostitution|premise|or that it should be abolished.
10919| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitutes have performed a valid social function for thousands of years.
10919| Prostitution|premise|Prostitution actually helps maintain marriages and relationships.
10920| Prostitution|conclusion|"Legalizing prostitution helps clean-up ""red light districts""."
10920| Prostitution|premise|Legalised brothels improve the quality of life for people who live and work in areas currently frequented by prostitutes.
10921| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution fulfills free-market political philosophies.
10921| Prostitution|premise|The political climate of free market capitalism, free economy, and globalization has created an atmosphere where it is easy for people to establish business that are related to sex.
10922| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution harms the fabric of society.
10922| Prostitution|premise|Sexual intercourse outside of a relationship of love, or even marriage, shows disregard for the sanctity of the sexual act and for the other partner in a relationship.
10923| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitutes will continue to work on the street even after legalization.
10923| Prostitution|premise|And, they are unlikely to work nearby to the competition offered by the licensed brothels.
10924| Prostitution|conclusion|Many libertarian feminists consider that prostitution reflects the independence and dominance of modern women.
10924| Prostitution|premise|The majority of prostitutes are women.
10925| Prostitution|conclusion|The overwhelming trend of feminism is against prostitution.
10925| Prostitution|premise|The radical feminist school that emerged in the 1990s supports the orthodoxy that prostitution leads to the objectification of women.
10926| Prostitution|conclusion|Legalizing prostitution would increase government revenue.
10926| Prostitution|premise|A tax on the fee charged by a prostitute, and the imposition of income tax on the earnings of prostitutes would generate revenue.
10927| Prostitution|conclusion|Prostitution often offers superior money-making opportunities for individuals.
10927| Prostitution|premise|Prostitution often offers individuals a much better option for making money than the alternatives.
10928| Prostitution|conclusion|An economic benefits from legalizing prostitution cannot take precedence over social harms.
10928| Prostitution|premise|Otherwise we would encourage governments to become involved in other unlawful trades, such as the trafficking of drugs.
10929| Prostitution|conclusion|Broader legalization of prostitution will reduce concentrated sex tourism.
10929| Prostitution|premise|The problem of a high concentration of ‘sex tourists’ in a small number of destinations will disappear once a larger number of countries legalise prostitution.
10930| Prostitution|conclusion|Countries that legalize prostitution will suffer from sex tourism.
10930| Prostitution|premise|Relaxed legal controls on prostitution in Thailand, the Philippines and Amsterdam have made these countries attractive for individuals, many of whom the local population would not regard as desirable visitors to a country or city.
10931| Prostitution|conclusion|Moral standards should stand above economics in banning prostitution.
10931| Prostitution|premise|Economic considerations, while sometimes significant, should not prevent a government from attempting to serve its primary purpose, which is to help provide a level of social and moral guidance.
10932| Pros and cons of drinking beer|conclusion|Beer is unavailable for minors.
10932| Pros and cons of drinking beer|premise|In most countries, people under a certain age cannot legally drink (alcoholic) beer.
10933| Pros and cons of drinking beer|conclusion|Drinking beer together can help to break barriers between people.
10933| Pros and cons of drinking beer|premise|Drinking beer in moderate volumes lowers the internal blocks, helping to initiate communication and eventually establish new friendships.
10934| Pros and cons of drinking beer|conclusion|Drinking beer can lead to socially erratic behavior.
10934| Pros and cons of drinking beer|premise|When the consumption of beer gets out of control, the outcomes can be quite disastrous.
10939| Protectionism|conclusion|Govts must address anti-competitive actions such as dumping.
10939| Protectionism|premise|While mediation by an international body is the most effective response to such actions, all nations must reserve the right to enact legislation to impose penalties on foreign companies that endeavor to gain market share through anti-completive practices.
10940| Protectionism|conclusion|Anti-dumping retaliation is just another form of protectionism.
10940| Protectionism|premise|Anti-dumping retaliation is as unnecessary and economically inefficient as any form of protectionism, and would rarely pass domestic antitrust legislation.
10941| Protectionism|conclusion|The first duty of every government is to protect its own citizens.
10941| Protectionism|premise|A duty of care is owed to those whose economic prosperity depends upon industrial production.
10942| Protectionism|conclusion|Prosperity a nation's citizens is enhanced by trade liberalization.
10942| Protectionism|premise|Given that free trade boosts imports as well as exports, given that it enhances competition, it effectively benefits not only the state, but also its citizens.
10943| Protectionism|conclusion|In times of recession there is pressure to protect declining industries.
10943| Protectionism|premise|Some localities, or countries, are dependent on a single source of manufacturing or agriculture, and allowing the free market to take its course would prolong or deepen an economic depression and drive huge numbers of people out of work.
10944| Protectionism|conclusion|Protectionism worsens depressions by cushioning firms from their effects.
10944| Protectionism|premise|preventing sufficient diversification of sources of national income, and discouraging retraining to meet the needs of the future.
10945| Protectionism|conclusion|Developing countries need help in building a competitive economy.
10945| Protectionism|premise|Short-term subsidies to foreign companies are the early stages of import-substitution and economic independence.
10946| Protectionism|conclusion|Difference between encouraging foreign industry abroad and protectionism at home.
10946| Protectionism|premise|Competition will not merely be over the size of national subsidies, but also on wage costs and looser environmental and safety regulations.
10947| Protectionism|conclusion|Developing economies hit glass ceiling as they attempt to stabilize economies.
10947| Protectionism|premise|as they are unable to diversify into different markets.
10948| Protectionism|conclusion|Companies in developing economies suffer from poor stockmarket flexibility and political uncertainty.
10948| Protectionism|premise|as a capitalist mentality needs time to develop.
10949| Protectionism|conclusion|It is sensible for governments to protect domestic supplies of vital goods, such as oil, food and steel, from the political vicissitudes of world cartels.
10949| Protectionism|premise|which is part of foreign policy and not pure economics.
10950| Protectionism|conclusion|Worldwide cartels of producers have recently weakened, especially for agricultural goods.
10950| Protectionism|premise|For governments to engage in protectionism merely against international cartels is pure hypocrisy; national security will never be gained by the chimera of economic self-sufficiency.
10951| Protectionism|conclusion|Protectionism undermines competition, thus slows economic progress down.
10951| Protectionism|premise|Just like, for example, Corn Laws in 19th century in England, protectionist measures harm competitors and drive up prices in home countries.
10954| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public health insurance offers citizens more choices.
10954| Public health insurance option|premise|"""public plan choice gives Americans the opportunity to choose for themselves how they value the strengths and weaknesses of a public, Medicare-like plan and competing private health plans."
10955| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance offers an option to uninsured and struggling.
10955| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Sure, some people are satisfied with their current health insurance."
10956| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Nobody will be forced into public insurance.
10956| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Now nobody is proposing that Americans be forced to get their insurance from the government."
10957| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Choosing between complicated health insurance plans is difficult.
10957| Public health insurance option|premise|"""there is considerable variation in health insurance products sold, and consumers have great difficulty in making price and quality comparisons."
10958| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Private insurers limit choice of doctors as much as public insurance.
10958| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Opponents of a public option say it will deny Americans the right to choose their own doctors."
10959| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Private insurers offer sufficient choices.
10959| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance."
10960| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance reduces choices by destroying private insurers.
10960| Public health insurance option|premise|"The American Medical Association and Senate Finance Committee: ""The introduction of a new public plan threatens to restrict patient choice by driving out private insurers, which currently provide coverage for nearly 70 percent of Americans."
10961| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public health insurance creates two-tiered system .
10961| Public health insurance option|premise|"""The best result of creating a parallel public insurance scheme is that the United States would end up with an explicit two-tier medical system in which privately insured Americans have better access to better medical care."
10962| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Government-run health insurance restricts doctor/patient choices.
10962| Public health insurance option|premise|"Republicans argued in a June 2009 letter to President Obama: ""Public insurance would be a federal government takeover of our healthcare system, taking decisions out of the hands of doctors and patients and placing them in the hands of a Washington bureaucracy."
10963| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance competes with private insurers, keeps them honest.
10963| Public health insurance option|premise|"President Barack Obama said in March of 2009: ""Public insurance gives consumers more choices, and it helps keep the private sector honest, because there’s some competition out there."
10964| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance stimulates competition in a non-competitive industry.
10964| Public health insurance option|premise|"""The arguments around the public plan too often ignore what we believe is the central reason for including a public plan as a component of reform: that health insurance markets today, by and large, are simply not competitive."
10965| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Contradictory to argue public option bad, insurers can't compete.
10965| Public health insurance option|premise|Critics of a public insurance option often argue simultaneously that a government-run insurance option is far worse, and less efficient than private insurance.
10966| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Progress with public plan is more important than competition.
10966| Public health insurance option|premise|"Insuring that over 40 million Americans have health insurance is much more important than the ideological notion of ""fair competition""."
10967| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Government will not favor public insurer over private insurers.
10967| Public health insurance option|premise|"""one argument against the public option is that the public plan will always be favored—that there is no way that Congress would let the public plan fail and would find ways to tilt the playing field in its favor, providing it with advantages not afforded private plans."
10968| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance would not kill the private insurance industry.
10968| Public health insurance option|premise|Probably the best evidence of this is found abroad in places such as France, where both public and private health insurance options exist in a hybrid system.
10969| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public and private insurers can learn from each other.
10969| Public health insurance option|premise|"""public and private plans can learn from each other as they exploit their strengths and remedy their weaknesses."
10970| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Insurers/conservatives oppose public insurance because it works.
10970| Public health insurance option|premise|"""A public option does crack the door open for expanding the number of Americans who get their health insurance through the government."
10971| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Insurance industry has sufficient competition without public option.
10971| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Advocates say a government-run insurance program is needed to provide competition for private health insurance."
10972| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Competition in private insurance can be improved without public plan.
10972| Public health insurance option|premise|While it is true that the private insurance industry does have some anti-competitive monopolies, conglomerations, and State boundary issues, this does not mean that a more competitive environment cannot be created.
10973| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance is unfair competition for private insurers.
10973| Public health insurance option|premise|"""A public program won't compete in a way that any normal business would recognize."
10974| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance would destroy private insurance industry.
10974| Public health insurance option|premise|"""government-run health insurance would crater the private insurance market, forcing most Americans onto the government plan."
10975| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public option monopoly squeezes health care suppliers, doctors.
10975| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Which raises the question: Would the existence of a dominant government provider of health insurance be good or bad?  A dominant government insurer  could potentially keep costs down by squeezing the suppliers of health care."
10976| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Government will favor public insurance.
10976| Public health insurance option|premise|"""It's simply impossible to believe the claims by Sen."
10977| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance meets moral obligation to insure the uninsured.
10977| Public health insurance option|premise|"""A public option health care agency proposed by many Democrats, and an important part of President Barack Obama’s health reform plan, needs a mission statement."
10978| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance is a good alternative for uninsured.
10978| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Sure, some people are satisfied with their current health insurance."

10982| Public health insurance option|conclusion|"Universal health care in the US is not a ""necessity""."
10982| Public health insurance option|premise|Health care is not a right.
10983| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance bureaucracies are better than private ones.
10983| Public health insurance option|premise|"""There is no doubt that the insurance companies and their Republican allies in Congress will fight the inclusion of a public option with every bit of power they can muster."
10984| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Insurers should not be trusted with sole control of health insurance.
10984| Public health insurance option|premise|"""As health policy expert Jeanne Lambrew puts the point, the question is not why nonelderly Americans without secure workplace coverage should have the same choice that seniors do: enrolling in a public or private plan."
10985| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance offers a valuable check on private insurance.
10985| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Public plan choice creates an institutional “check and balance,” encouraging private plans to uphold high standards of quality, affordability, and access."
10986| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance is public-private hybrid, not socialized medicine.
10986| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Public option is not an argument for a universal Medicare program, but instead for a “hybrid” approach that builds on the best elements of the present system—large group plans in the public and private sectors—while putting in place a new means by which those without access to secure workplace insurance can choose among health plans that provide strong guarantees of quality, affordable coverage."
10987| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Private insurers ration as-much or more than public insurance.
10987| Public health insurance option|premise|"Critics frequently argue that government-run health care involves the government ""rationing"" health care."

10988| Public health insurance option|premise|"""A growing number of Americans already get their health care from a public plan, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Plan (the Department of Veterans Affairs, of course, also provides benefits)."
10989| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Efforts to create a public-private insurance hybrid are in good faith.
10989| Public health insurance option|premise|There is no reason to believe that the intentions of those that are advocating for a public option are bent on destroying the insurance industry and creating a single-payer system.
10990| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Conservatives fear successful public plan undermines their arguments.

10994| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public option forces taxpayers to pay for other people's insurance.
10994| Public health insurance option|premise|Those that decide to keep their private insurance will gain nothing from the public insurance option, and will actually have to subsidize the public insurance option by paying higher taxes.
10995| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public option is only an ideological symbol for the left.
10995| Public health insurance option|premise|"""The public option has become for the left what ""death panels"" have become for the right -- an easily understood metaphor that can be used to wage an ideological war over the issue of Big Government, and mostly a sideshow."
10996| Public health insurance option|conclusion|US private insurance is inferior to foreign public-private hybrids.
10996| Public health insurance option|premise|"""If we're smart and lucky, we might end up with a system resembling the one they have in France (rated by the World Health Organization as the world's best), where basic health insurance is provided by the government, but most people have supplemental private insurance to fill in the gaps in coverage."

11017| Public health insurance option|premise|"2009 Statement by the American Nurses Association: ""A public health insurance plan would expand choices and help protect against potential economic calamity for individuals or families who are not satisfied with their current health coverage, have difficulty paying for their health care, or cannot find affordable coverage."
11018| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Expensive public insurance option would worsen national debt.
11018| Public health insurance option|premise|"""the public option is far too expensive."
11019| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance costs will grow as private insurance is pushed out.
11019| Public health insurance option|premise|"The American Medical Association argued in June of 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee: ""If private insurers are pushed out of the market, the group said, 'the corresponding surge in public plan participation would likely lead to an explosion of costs that would need to be absorbed by taxpayers."
11020| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance will be used excessively at greater cost.
11020| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Excess Use."
11021| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance inefficiencies can be hidden by taxpayer-funding.
11021| Public health insurance option|premise|"""The central problem with proposals to create a new government program, however, is not that government is less efficient than private insurers, but that government can hide its inefficiencies and draw consumers away from private insurance, despite offering an inferior product."
11022| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance option will increase taxes, drag-down economy.
11022| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Who covers the rest? Government passes the bill for the outstanding balance to providers and families not covered by government programs."
11023| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Low admin costs of public insurance don't mean lower overall costs.
11023| Public health insurance option|premise|"Benjamin Sasse, a former official at the Department of Health and Human Services: ""As the case of Medicare's anemic anti-fraud efforts painfully illustrates, less management and lower administrative costs do not necessarily mean the program is really less costly."
11024| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance may force private insurance rate increase.
11024| Public health insurance option|premise|"""As people gravitate to 'free' or heavily subsidized care, the inevitably explosive costs will be covered in part with increased outlays to keep premiums artificially low or even offer extra benefits."
11025| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Medicare out-performs private insurance, is a model for public insurance.
11025| Public health insurance option|premise|"""The case made in this brief is that this menu of health plans must include a good public plan modeled after Medicare if the broad goals of reform—universal insurance and improved value—are to be achieved."
11026| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Costs of Medicare/Medicaid show public insurance waste.
11026| Public health insurance option|premise|"""The largest existing public health programs — Medicare and Medicaid — are the main reason that the government’s long-term finances are in shambles."
11027| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public option is better way to universal care than mandates.
11027| Public health insurance option|premise|"""most major health insurance markets are dominated by two or three companies so there is no real competition -particularly with respect to price."
11028| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Mandates wrongly give insurers millions of new customers.
11028| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Once everyone is required by mandates to buy insurance, the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines."
11029| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Universal care better achieved with mandates than public option.
11029| Public health insurance option|premise|"""One argument is that a government-sponsored plan is needed so that Americans with modest income and chronic medical problems -- the kind of people who are literally uninsurable -- can be assured of getting coverage."
11030| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public option is needed because regulating insurers is insufficient.
11030| Public health insurance option|premise|"""to have a workable system without the public option, you need to have effective regulation of the insurers."
11031| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Status quo of insurance company control is unacceptable.

11033| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance is an essential and nonnegotiable part of reform.
11033| Public health insurance option|premise|"Howard Dean told the Washington Post: ""The worst thing that could happen is to pass a bill without a public option."
11034| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance option is a reasonable compromise.
11034| Public health insurance option|premise|The public insurance option is a compromise between the very prominent extremes of those that want the continuation of the status quo - with solely private insurance companies in charge of health care - and those that advocate for a single-payer system, in which insurance companies simply cease to exist.
11035| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public option is next best option to single-payer health care.
11035| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Although the public option wasn't the topic of a great deal of discussion during the campaign, for many progressives it amounts to a beautiful jewel hidden amidst a pile of compromise and disappointment."
11036| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Pursuit of bipartisan reform should not hold up public option.
11036| Public health insurance option|premise|"""What we really need is a 'bipartisan' health-reform bill -- and if Democrats act properly, they could get one."
11037| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public option jeopardizes passing healthcare reform legislation.
11037| Public health insurance option|premise|"""I've spent the last 30 years trying to achieve affordable health coverage for all Americans, so it's frustrating to see the obsession with a 'public plan' making it impossible for reasonable people from both parties to come together."
11039| Public health insurance option|conclusion|There are not enough votes to pass a public insurance plan.

11040| Public health insurance option|premise|"""big business and small business can finally be persuaded that a strong public insurance program is in their interest, since it will save them money (their prior opposition to health care reform has always been more ideological than economic)."
11041| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance makes workers healthier and more productive.
11041| Public health insurance option|premise|A public insurance option will guarantee universal coverage, and will ensure that people with medical conditions receive the preventive care they need, which saves money in long-term health care costs.
11043| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance will be paid for by taxes on businesses.
11043| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Mr."
11044| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance will give doctors/hospitals millions of new patients.
11044| Public health insurance option|premise|It is surprising that the American Medical Association would complain about over forty million Americans suddenly having insurance so that they can pay doctors and hospitals for health care services.
11046| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Hospitals may be overwhelmed by new public-insurance patients.
11046| Public health insurance option|premise|"American Medical Association said in a June 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee that it ""cannot support any plan design that mandates physician participation."
11047| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance wrongly mandates physician participation.
11047| Public health insurance option|premise|"The American Medical Association wrote in a June 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee that the association, ""cannot support any plan design that mandates physician participation."
11048| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Public insurance will discourage people from becoming doctors.
11048| Public health insurance option|premise|Public insurance, and the specter of increasingly socialized medicine, will discourage prospective doctors from entering the industry, as they will fear that their hard work will not be fairly rewarded.
11049| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Cooperatives are an insufficient alternative to a public option.
11049| Public health insurance option|premise|Senator John Rockefeller.
11050| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Co-ops are not government-run like public insurance.
11050| Public health insurance option|premise|"""As prospects fade for a public, or government-run, option as part of health-care reform, key senators are considering another model to create competition for private insurers: member-owned, nonprofit health cooperatives."
11051| Public health insurance option|conclusion|US polls find a majority favor a public insurance option.
11051| Public health insurance option|premise|According to an October, 2009 CNN poll, 61% of sampled Americans favor a public option (55% back in August, while 4% were undecided).
11052| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Divisions on public vs. private healthcare suggests a hybrid.
11052| Public health insurance option|premise|"""Perhaps that is why Americans have long been strongly supportive of public-private hybrids in health care, believing that neither the government nor private insurance should be the sole source of coverage in a reformed system."
11053| Public health insurance option|conclusion|Following majority support for public option is tyranny of majority.
11053| Public health insurance option|premise|Appeal to the majority is nothing more than tyranny of the majority and means absolutely nothing to whether a public insurance option is worth it or will even help.

11066| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""What about the issue of the English language? Some have made the argument that Puerto Rico should not be a state because Puerto Ricans do not speak English, and we should not have a non-English speaking state."

11067| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""The foreignness of English in Puerto Rico is greater in magnitude than it was in any state at any time in our national experience."

11071| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""Look at what happened to the last two states admitted to the Union, Hawaii and Alaska."
11072| Puerto Rico statehood in America|conclusion|Puerto Rico would burden US welfare system.
11072| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""Puerto Rican Statehood and the Budget Deficit."

11073| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""The facts say that the United States can't afford a 51st state of Puerto Rico: Puerto Rico's per capita income of $8,509 is less than one third of the US average, and about one half that of Mississippi, the poorest state."
11074| Puerto Rico statehood in America|conclusion|Puerto Rican independence no option.
11074| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""If Puerto Rico were to vote for independence, even though there is no evidence that they will, it would also be costly."
11075| Puerto Rico statehood in America|conclusion|Puerto Rico commonwealth status not meant to be permanent.
11075| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""Commonwealth status was never meant to be permanent , it was meant as a transitional step."

11076| Puerto Rico statehood in America|premise|"""Puerto Rico’s per capita GDP is quite high compared to Latin American countries and independence would seem to imperil that with no practical upside."

11084| Quotas for women in corporate boards|premise|Gender quotas help women break the glass ceiling and aim for top positions that were previously mostly held by men.
11085| Quotas for women in corporate boards|conclusion|Affirmative action equals discrimination.
11085| Quotas for women in corporate boards|premise|Not only that any discrimination is inherently unjust, but also the fact that these quotas would disadvantage more qualified men over less qualified women who just happen to be in the right place at the right time is everything but justifiable.
11089| Quotas for women in corporate boards|conclusion|Women possess different skills than men.
11089| Quotas for women in corporate boards|premise|Women are generally better at communicating with people or considering various ways to address certain issues, which makes them ideal work partners for men in corporate boards.

11106| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Random sobriety tests are a just public safety intervention.
11106| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|Robert Solomon, a law professor at the University of Western Ontario and the director of legal policy for MADD Canada, argues that implementing random sobriety tests on roads would be a just impingement on Canadian's lives because of the death and injury toll drunk driving is inflicting there: “We have one of the worst records for impaired driving of any comparable democracies.
11107| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Operating dangerous vehicles requires giving up some rights.
11107| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|The U.
11108| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Random breath tests are done to public vehicle drivers.
11108| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|It can hardly be called an invasion of privacy or an investigation without due cause, because random tests are routinely carried out by many train and bus companies and are being introduced on airlines as well.
11109| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|RBT just an extension of already strict driving regulations.
11109| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD): ""Driving is a heavily regulated, licensed activity occurring on public roads."
11110| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|"""Reasonable suspicion"" too high standard for detecting drunk drivers."
11110| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"""Unless a driver admits to drinking, the police currently need clear visible signs that the driver has consumed alcohol or was driving in an impaired manner in order to demand a roadside screening test."
11111| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|RBT has been successfully implemented in many modern democracies.
11111| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"""Random breath testing has been in place in most comparable democracies for as long as 30 years."
11112| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Random sobriety tests amount to unreasonable searches.
11112| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"""In a free society it should be the case that a citizen can move about at will without ever being hindered by the police."
11113| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Randomly testing employees is different than testing citizens.
11113| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|People who have to take random breath tests to drive trucks or fly planes as part of their jobs are taking the test as part of their job.
11114| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Random breath tests are an inconvenience and make people angry.
11114| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|Generally speaking, inconveniencing innocent people and introducing random sobriety tests into their lives will make many people angry.
11115| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Utility of stopping every car doesn't justify breach of rights.
11115| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"Dissenting US Supreme Court justices argued in a case that struck down an effort to ban random drug tests in Michigan: ""That stopping every car might make it easier to prevent drunken driving."
11116| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|"""Random"" breath tests likely to be implemented unequally."
11116| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"Canadian Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh and the former attorney general of British Columbia and a member of the House justice committee: ""I wouldn’t want the east side of Vancouver monitored more than the west side of Vancouver because there is a clear economic division in the city."

11119| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD): ""RBT deters impaired driving by increasing the perceived chance of detection."
11120| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|People drive drunk because they can get away with it.

11122| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"""The Australian RBT programs, which have been the most extensively studied, have resulted in dramatic reductions in impaired driving deaths and injuries."
11123| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Random alcohol tests are more effective than alternative measures.
11123| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"The federal Justice Department of Canada moved to implement Random Breath Testing (RBT), concluding: ""a system of random checks is more effective than a combination of other measures such as a lower threshold for blood alcohol level and more frequent RIDE checkpoints."
11124| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Random breath testing doesn't necessarily lower drunk driving.
11124| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|Many countries have had random testing for some time and have seen no real fall in drink driving figures.
11125| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Little evidence random alcohol tests deter drunk driving.
11125| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|There is a dearth of research regarding the deterrent effect of checkpoints.
11126| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Repeat drunk drivers unlikely to respond to RBT deterrence.
11126| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|"""One statistic the MAD bunch doesn’t like to mention is the fact that half of the people killed by drunk drivers have at least double the legal blood alcohol limit."
11127| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Everyone knows drunk driving is wrong.
11127| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|Of course drink driving is wrong.
11128| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Most drunk drivers aren't caught through random breath tests.
11128| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|The majority of people caught drink driving have not been from random breath tests.
11129| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Good use of police to cultivate awareness on drunk driving.
11129| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|Guaranteeing a culture of awareness that the driver might be subjected to testing – and thereby ensuring people drink responsibly – can be achieved by random testing.
11130| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Random breath tests worthwhile.
11130| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|You cannot say that random breath testing is a waste of money.
11131| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Police are already performing random alcohol stops.
11131| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|In reality, even where random testing is not allowed, most officers realize that this is necessary – that is why they often make up reasons to stop people (like claiming they were driving erratically) in order to carry out a de facto random testing system already.
11132| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Police time is better spent pursing proper offenders.
11132| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|Police time is better spent pursuing those about whom there are concrete suspicions, rather than trawling society at large in the hope of turning something up.
11136| Random sobriety tests for drivers|conclusion|Individuals should be able to judge whether they are okay to drive.
11136| Random sobriety tests for drivers|premise|It is still legal to have a drink and then drive – but the culture of nanny state control is increasingly meaning that self-righteous moral pundits condemn people for doing so, when in truth it should be up to the individual to judge whether they are ok to drive.
11138| Reality entertainment programme|conclusion|Surveillance already exists - and for good reasons.
11138| Reality entertainment programme|premise|Surveillance is nothing unusual in today's world, especially if you consider security cameras and checks.

11144| Reality entertainment programme|conclusion|Reality shows bring taboos into spotlight.
11144| Reality entertainment programme|premise|Shocking reality shows are valuable, because they force the society to think about stereotypes, taboos, and biases.

11156| Reality entertainment programme|conclusion|Scripted shows are further from reality.
11156| Reality entertainment programme|premise|Precisely because reality shows are not scripted, they reflect the reality the best, as they are not a product of someone's imagination.
11179| Reducing value added tax on contraceptives|conclusion|Theoretically lower taxes mean a better usage of public health funds.
11179| Reducing value added tax on contraceptives|premise|Those in higher income brackets will pay for contraceptives from the private sector meaning that those less well off can use the public sector healthcare and therefore equity is achieved.
11181| Reducing value added tax on contraceptives|conclusion|Privatisation can result from cheaper costs.
11181| Reducing value added tax on contraceptives|premise|In the Phillipines an incentive to cut VAT and Duties on contraception imports was due to the increased liklihood of privatisation.

11185| Reducing value added tax on contraceptives|conclusion|Economic theory states that VAT may not be the best form of taxation.
11185| Reducing value added tax on contraceptives|premise|"To maintain economic efficiency Kenneth Arrow suggested that instead ""all efficient outcomes can be acheived in a perfectly competitives market, simply by adjusting the starting positions""."
11193| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|conclusion|Reforestation sequesters C02 and helps reverse global warming.
11193| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|premise|"""According to a neat calculator on the Web site of Casey Trees, a fair-size white oak tree with an 18-inch-diameter trunk would reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide by 622 pounds per year."
11194| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|conclusion|Reforestation can immediately reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases.
11194| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|premise|Reforestation leads to the immediate growth of trees, and, therefore, the immediate reduction of greenhouse gases.

11203| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|conclusion|Aerial reforestation cuts costs of reforestation.
11203| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|premise|"""Thousand Of Seed-Containing Bomblets Dropped to Reforest Mangrove Forest Since it’s too labor intensive and too slow to reforest large areas of land by hand, foot, shovel and trowel, why not try to use aircraft to drop thousands of small bomblets containing a tree seed (in the experiment in the show, mangrove seeds) and some soil over deforested areas? It would be much quicker than manual reforestation and the principle could be applied to pretty much any type of forest in the world."

11204| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|premise|"""The primary benefit of land carbon sinks is that they can be effective immediately and provide a financial incentive for the preservation and sustainable use of forests and agriculture land."
11205| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|conclusion|Reforestation less cost-effective than reducing emissions.
11205| Reforestation as a solution to global warming|premise|"Professor John Shepherd, director of Britain's Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, said in 2001, ""Our view is that the argument is being diverted into what is really a rather unproductive area and people should get back to talking about carbon emission reductions at source by use of renewable (fuels) and whatever else they think is necessary."

11348| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|Displaying cultural treasures in their original cultural context, allows them to be better understood.
11348| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|In the case of the Elgin marbles this is an architectural context which only proximity to the Parthenon itself can provide.
11349| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|The display of cultural treasures in western museums is an anachronism based on the false notion that only Western minds can appreciate these treasures.
11349| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|This notion is drawn from the imperial belief that “civilised” states such as Britain were the true successors to Greece and Rome, and that the modern inhabitants of those ancient regions were unable to appreciate or look after their great artistic heritage.
11350| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|Art treasures should be accessible to the greatest number of people and to scholars, which means retaining them in the great museums of the world.
11350| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|Returning treasures to their original context is impossible, too much has changed physically and culturally over the centuries for them to speak more clearly in their country of origin than they do in museums, where they can be compared to large assemblies of objects from a wide variety of cultures.
11351| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|Many artefacts were acquired illegally or unethically, giving cause to their return.
11351| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|Artefacts such as the Parthenon marbles were often acquired illegally, for example through looting in war (the Benin bronzes), under the duress of imperial force (many Chinese artefacts), or by bribing officials to ignore the carrying away of sculptures from monuments they were meant to be guarding (the Elgin marbles).
11352| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|It is not always clear how artefacts were acquired , making it impossible to determine a basis for their return to a country of origin.
11352| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|Although some art treasures may have been acquired illegally, the evidence for this is often ambiguous.
11353| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|History is history, and modern museums should not be punished for past sins by having to return their collections to countries of origin.
11353| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|For whatever reason the treasures were first collected, we should not rewrite history; sending artefacts such as the Elgin marbles back to their country of origin would set a bad precedent that could denude museums around the world of their collections.
11354| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|Some foreign displays of artifacts violate the cultural or religious doctrines of cultures from which artifacts were taken.
11354| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|Some cultural treasures, e.
11355| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|Sometimes cultural and religious implications are voided by the sale or transfer of an artifact from one culture to another, and when it is for certain purposes.
11355| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|This may be true, but religious artefacts may have been originally purchased or given in good faith, perhaps with the intention of educating a wider public about the beliefs of their creators.
11356| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|It may have been true that countries such as Greece were not capable of looking after their heritage in the past, but that has now changed.
11356| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|A state-of-the-art museum is planned in Athens to house the surviving marbles, while pollution control measures have reduced sulphur-dioxide levels in the city to a fifth of their previous levels.
11357| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|It is sometimes legitimate for foreign countries to remove artifacts in order to preserve or save them.
11357| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|In the case of the Parthenon marbles, Lord Elgin’s action in removing them was an act of rescue as the Ottoman authorities were pillaging them for building stone, caring nothing for the classical Greek heritage.
11358| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|conclusion|War-torn countries are not ideal recipients of cultural artifacts.
11358| Returning cultural treasures to country of origin|premise|A significant portion of cultural treasures was stolen from countries that are now in a poor shape (be it due to a raging civil war, famine, etc.
11359| Return of Israel to pre-1967 borders|conclusion|"Pre-1967 territory is ""occupied"", must be returned."

11410| Right to bear arms in the US|premise|The ability to form a militia is dependent on citizens owning guns and being able to bring them to a militia.
11411| Right to bear arms in the US|conclusion|The 2nd amendment protects the ability to form a militia not the ongoing existence of one.
11411| Right to bear arms in the US|premise|Militias are relevant today as a symbol of preventing tyranny.

11435| Roma nation|conclusion|Roma are a nation.
11435| Roma nation|premise|According to Ian Hancock, the Roma are an ethnically distinct community, having descended from Indian ethnic groups assembled as a military force to resist Islamic incursions and their total population outnumbers that of many of the Union’s members.
11436| Roma nation|conclusion|There is considerable nationalist sentiment among the Roma.
11436| Roma nation|premise|The International Romany Union claims to represent 10 million Roma and has successfully fostered the idea of “self rallying”.
11437| Roma nation|conclusion|The Roma are in fact extremely culturally, linguistically, and religiously varied with little common basis for nationhood.
11437| Roma nation|premise|Only 4 million at most speak any kind of Romany.
11438| Roma nation|conclusion|Recognising nationhood on the basis of ethnicity is divisive and will undermine the positive trend towards multicultural nation states.
11438| Roma nation|premise|This proposal is founded on the ethnic nationalism that is often blamed for Eastern Europe’s brutal history and is likely to increase instability by encouraging groups like the Corsican and Basque separatists.
11439| Roma nation|conclusion|The IRU should not be considered representative of the world’s Romany people.

11441| Roma nation|premise|Despite well-documented ill treatment of the Roma the Czech Republic was put on the fast track to membership.
11442| Roma nation|conclusion|Centuries of persecution do not qualify the Roma for nationhood.
11442| Roma nation|premise|We must focus on forcing Europe’s existing states to respect human rights and encourage organisations like the IRU, which already has an office in Brussels, to lobby to ensure that minority rights are respected in every country.
11443| Roma nation|conclusion|An independent Roma may encourage European politicians to shirk their responsibilities to Roma populations in their own countries.
11443| Roma nation|premise|Encouraging minorities to see the Romany as a separate nation allows politicians to avoid taking responsibility for their situation.
11444| Roma nation|conclusion|The expansion of the EU has led to improved treatment of the Roma.
11444| Roma nation|premise|Slovakia was excluded from the first wave of would-be members due to a poor record on minority rights.
11445| Roma nation|conclusion|Recognising the Roma as a nation and thus granting direct access to development aid would reduce the burden on countries with particularly large gypsy populations.
11445| Roma nation|premise|For example, Romania has 2 million gypsies, the largest population of them in the world.
11446| Roma nation|conclusion|National governments and civil services are the best people to administer long-term development projects for the Roma.
11446| Roma nation|premise|They are aware of the specific needs of the Roma within their borders and can coordinate legislative policy, cultural and education programmes and existing projects with new development schemes to increase the effectiveness of available resources.
11447| Roma nation|conclusion|Nationhood would enable the strengthening of Roma schools, which have proved very important to the education of Romanys.
11447| Roma nation|premise|Education is the key to lifting the Romany community out of poverty and welfare dependency.
11448| Roma nation|conclusion|Establishing a parallel education system within a nation will continue the marginalization of the Roma.
11448| Roma nation|premise|Without a territory of their own the Roma will always remain reliant on the nations in which they live.

11537| Scottish independence|conclusion|"The economic effects of independence would be ""impossible"" to predict, making it a poor point to use in favor of independence."
11537| Scottish independence|premise|"""The honest answer to all questions about whether Scotland would gain or lose revenues from independence is that predictions on this are impossible and don’t matter very much."
11538| Scottish independence|conclusion|"The economic impact would be ""irrelevant""."
11538| Scottish independence|premise|"""The economic effects would be Irrelevant because the sums involved – a net inflow this year of about £3 billion annually, roughly matched by similar outflows in the 1980s when North Sea output was near its peak and public sector wages were lower – are far too small to affect the balance between the immense historical arguments on both sides of the independence debate."

11541| Scrapping the Euro|conclusion|ECB is Unresponsive.
11541| Scrapping the Euro|premise|The ECB has too large a constituency, too large a responsibility, and too large a power: it becomes impossible to respond swiftly with a bureaucratic apparatus as big as the ECB has to have to keep checks on the entire Eurozone.

11682| Should Japan remove limitations on its military?|premise|Rwanda and Cambodia, to name but two – and have no such constraint imposed upon them.
11683| Should Japan remove limitations on its military?|conclusion|The constitutional restriction springs from the circumstances that led to the governance of Japan being administered by Western powers.
11683| Should Japan remove limitations on its military?|premise|That has not been the case with other countries that have committed atrocities, such as Cambodia: if it did, perhaps they would have this restriction too.

11769| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Health is often out of an individual's control.
11769| Single-payer universal health care|premise|You will see that the other side of this argument makes a distinction between things that an individual can control and those he/she cannot.
11770| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Health problems are more about individual choices than fires and crime.
11770| Single-payer universal health care|premise|While many people compare health care to police stations and fire stations, they are not the same services.
11771| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Whether universal health care is analogous to other services is inconsequential.
11771| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Whether universal health care is analogous or a legitimate burden on tax payers does not answer whether a universal system provides the results proponents argue.
11772| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|When the wealthy must use public health care, the system improves.
11772| Single-payer universal health care|premise|If the wealthy are not allowed to buy better health insurance, and are forced to use public single-payer health care, they come to realize that the only way to ensure good care is to pressure for good universal health care.
11773| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Many single-payer systems give patients free choice of practitioners.
11773| Single-payer universal health care|premise|In some countries with socialized medicine, such as the UK, patients are offered a choice of general practitioner, all of whom are self-employed or work in private partnerships employing all practice nurses, doctors and clerical staff.
11774| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|People have a right to pay more for better health care.
11774| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""There's also the freedom argument."
11775| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care will have rules that decrease patient flexibility.
11775| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Government-controlled health care would lead to a decrease in patient flexibility."
11776| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Free, universal health care helps the unhealthy in times of need.
11776| Single-payer universal health care|premise|When an individual is sick, they shouldn't have to think about how to pay for their treatment.
11777| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|It is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance.
11777| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable (people of higher risk of becoming ill) pay more for health insurance.
11778| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Unacceptable to leave health care of millions to rare charity orgs/docs.
11778| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is morally unacceptable to leave the health care of millions of American who cannot afford to pay insurance to the hands of the few rare doctors and charity health care services.
11779| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer systems make it harder to get care when it's most needed.
11779| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Delays are a common feature of single-payer systems.
11780| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|A right to health care is not necessary in taking care of sick patients.
11780| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Indigent patients have been taken care of by physicians with dignity and compassion in the name of genuine charity, pro bono.
11781| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Health care is a basic human right or entitlement.
11781| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights.
11782| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care protects healthy citizens from many health risks.
11782| Single-payer universal health care|premise|If citizens have a right to be healthy, they are due some protections from the sickly.
11783| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Health care is considered a right in international law.
11783| Single-payer universal health care|premise|of The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights enumerates medical care as a universal right.
11784| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care is a social good, not merely an economic good.
11784| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Universal health care generally decreases human misery and increases human welfare.
11785| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|"Universal health care is a legitimate ""burden"" on the tax payer."
11785| Single-payer universal health care|premise|People pay for public utilities such as road and people pay for education as well.
11786| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal healthcare helps foster greater equality across classes.
11786| Single-payer universal health care|premise|In the United States, the poor commonly cannot afford health care.
11787| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care violates individual freedom and responsibility.
11787| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is important that individuals be treated as free moral agents, accountable to their own actions, and not held accountable to the actions of others.
11788| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|"Free, universal health care is an illegitimate ""positive"" right."
11788| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"The main premises here is that ""rights"" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable."
11789| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|The necessity of medical care does not make it a right.
11789| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Food, for example, is not considered a right, and companies are allowed to sell it, as well as to withhold it from those that need it but can't afford it.
11790| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|People leading healthy lives will be burdened by the unhealthy.
11790| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is not fair for those that lead healthy lives to have to pay for those that lead unhealthy ones.
11791| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|People should pay only for health services they themselves receive.
11791| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Why should one person pay for the health services of another person? With the possible exception of life-threatening circumstances; isn't it better that individuals pay for the services they receive.
11792| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|"Securing a ""right"" to universal health means impeding on other rights."
11792| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Providing universal health care means increasing costs to certain taxpayers.
11793| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care systems suffer from inequality of care.
11793| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Some studies have found that universal health care systems are vulnerable to socio-economic inequalities in the care provided.
11794| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Government-funded universal health care would violate patient privacy.
11794| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Currently, many Americans choose to pay privately for health services to maintain their medical privacy."
11795| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Whether health care is a right under i-law is inconsequential.
11795| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The mere act that a UN body on Human Rights has added that to their charter is not definitive of anything.
11796| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|"Whether universal health care is a legitimate ""burden"" on the tax payer should be considered inconsequential."
11796| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Since health care is currently 1/7th of the US Economy, simply asking whether the tax payer can be burdened to help provide others with health care does nothing to ask whether allowing more government control will end with the results proponents predict.
11797| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Whether universal health care is a social good is inconsequential.
11797| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Again, this question's answer has no bearing on whether a universal system can provide the level of service proponents claim.
11798| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|It is impossible to answer whether universal health care fosters greater equality.
11798| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"Since the word equality necessitates a value judgment as to what is ""equal"" when it comes to health care and class status, a universal definition is not possible."
11799| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Government-funded universal health care is no right.
11799| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""People sometimes argue in favor of a universal human right to health care by saying that health care is different from all other human goods or products."
11800| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Most uninsured simply can't afford it.
11800| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""It's the uninsured's fault that they're uninsured."
11801| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal care would protect doctors/hospitals from free-loaders.
11801| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Uncompensated care is a problem for hospitals and doctors.
11802| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care is not welfare.
11802| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Universal health care is about cutting costs, streamlining patient care, simplifying care, and providing high quality health care to all citizens.
11803| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|It is a myth that the uninsured are being provided for now.
11803| Single-payer universal health care|premise|While some argue that the uninsured being provided for currently with access to emergency rooms and social programs, it is false to claim that this is a substitute for these individuals actually having health insurance.
11804| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|The well insured also face risks without universal health care.
11804| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The uninsured are not the only concern when a society lacks universal health care.
11805| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|If people are uninsured, that's their choice.
11805| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Some people, especially young and healthy people, may choose not to buy health insurance even when it is cheaperSo what should the government do about the holdouts? Leave them alone."
11806| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Many uninsured are lazy free-loaders who don't deserve care.
11806| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Many uninsured are simply lazy, and believe they can get a free ride off of the system.
11807| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care would amount to welfare for the uninsured.
11807| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The government should not create a health care system that is aimed primarily at helping the poor and uninsured.
11808| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Many uninsured can easily afford it so should not receive sympathy.
11808| Single-payer universal health care|premise|A significant proportion of the uninsured can easily afford insurance.
11809| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|The uninsurance problem should be solved by less, not more government.
11809| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Collectively, the uninsured pay about $17."
11811| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer systems involve government paying for private services.
11811| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Most single-payer systems in Europe, as well as ones proposed in the United States (building on Medicare), involve the government paying for the insurance of individuals.
11812| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Rationing already exist in the US.
11812| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""The U."
11813| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|A single-payer system will not cause government to intrude in medical decisions.
11813| Single-payer universal health care|premise|There is nothing in universal health care that would indicate that the government would intrude on the medical decisions of citizens.
11814| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer health care is socialized medicine.
11814| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"Lenin said, ""medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism."
11815| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care leads to rationing.
11815| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Medical resources are rationed in socialized systems so that some people are either denied care or have to wait for it.
11816| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Government intrudes in medical decisions in a single-payer system.
11816| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Government will involve itself in decisions between doctors and patients under a single-payer system.
11817| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care creates dependencies on government.
11817| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Whenever the government provides free services to individuals, a dependency is created.
11820| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care can actually strengthen doctor pay.
11820| Single-payer universal health care|premise|If there are more insured patients within a universal health care system, more people will seek health care.
11821| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer systems insure individuals, but don't restrict doctors.
11821| Single-payer universal health care|premise|A universal health care system does not mean that the private market should be abolished.
11822| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care grounds doctors in professionalism, not commercialism.
11822| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Doctors are currently businessmen that sell health services.
11823| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|A right to health care violates the rights of physicians.
11823| Single-payer universal health care|premise|One cannot have a right to other people's services.
11824| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care will cut physician cash-flow and disrupt living-standards.
11824| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is important to recognize that many private physicians have oriented their private practices around a certain level of cash-flow.
11825| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care would lower rewards so reduce quality of physicians.
11825| Single-payer universal health care|premise|With fewer financial incentives, fewer individuals would decide to become physicians in the first place.
11826| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer health care over-loads doctors and burns them out.
11826| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Because more people seek care, doctors in a universal health care environment often are over-loaded.
11827| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|For-profit insurance companies often put patients at risk to cut costs.
11827| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"Health insurance claims are considered a ""loss"" for profit insurance companies."
11828| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Insurance companies screen out those that need health care the most.
11828| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"Insurance companies have a interest in maximizing profits that drives them to screen out individuals that are unhealthy, old, and ""high-risk""."
11829| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care systems incentivize improving patient health.
11829| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Many free universal health care systems provide incentives to doctors to improve the health of their patients.
11830| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care will allow doctors to concentrate on patients.
11830| Single-payer universal health care|premise|In private and managed health care networks, doctors typically have to check with insurance companies before they perform a service.
11831| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care allows investments in longer-term patient relationships.
11831| Single-payer universal health care|premise|This happens because there is a long term relationship with the patient and the preservation of records has long term benefits.
11832| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care decreases the likelihood of health related problems.
11832| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The single most destructive issue regarding health care in America is the lack of preventative care.
11833| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|The markets are better at providing quality.
11833| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The markets and competition generally help produce higher quality goods for the least money (the highest value).
11834| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Government-mandated procedures would reduce doctor flexibility/quality.
11834| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Government-mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care."
11835| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Quality of health care is much worse under universal health care.
11835| Single-payer universal health care|premise|According to Reuters in London, one in 10 patients admitted to National Health Service hospitals in Britain is unintentionally harmed and almost a million safety incidents, more than 2,000 of which were fatal, were recorded last year, according to a report on July 6, 2006.
11836| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|IT investments do not require government intervention.
11836| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Some have argued that IT enhancements in a universal system will provide efficiency improvements.
11837| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Lack of preventative care does not significantly contribute to life expectancy or quality of life.
11837| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Most of what determines length and quality of life (excluding human issues such as traffic accidents, homicides.
11838| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Free universal health care motivates people to seek preventive care.
11838| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Preventing illnesses before they arise is a very important strategy in public health.
11839| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Government has a cost incentive to invest in preventive care.
11839| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""The VA also invests heavily and systematically in preventive care, because unlike private health care providers it can expect to realize financial benefits from measures that keep its clients out of the hospital."
11840| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Better technologies and treatments in private health care aids prevention.
11840| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Private health care societies are known for having better innovation and higher investment in equipment and high-end treatments.
11841| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Higher-end treatment is important.
11841| Single-payer universal health care|premise|With higher-end treatments in privatized health care societies, treatment is often superior.
11842| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Medical innovation has little to do with investment and profit.
11842| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""The development of DBS was one part basic knowledge--an understanding of how Parkinson's works and how the brain responds to electrical stimulation--and one part sheer luck."
11843| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Most investment in medical innovation does not come from companies.
11843| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Private companies make up a smaller portion of the total investment in medical innovation.
11844| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Profit interests corrupt investments in medical innovation.
11844| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Drug and medical companies are driven, in large part, by the bottom-line of profits.
11845| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer health care hinders medical investment and innovation.
11845| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The primary cause of this is a reduction in economic incentives for innovation.
11846| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Under investment in single-payer system leads to capacity shortages.
11846| Single-payer universal health care|premise|A lack of willingness to invest in expensive technology leads to shortages in areas such as MRI scanning.
11847| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care creates a universal standard of care.
11847| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""The other advantage of universal health care is that it creates a clear standard of care."
11848| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Government will set an inferior standard of health care.
11848| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Private competition also helps assure quality."
11849| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|It is a myth that the United States' private system has fewer delays.
11849| Single-payer universal health care|premise|In the United States, delays are often caused by insurance companies trying to save money.
11850| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Public health care is good.
11850| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Public health care systems receive more scrutiny by the public because they are publicly accountable.
11851| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer health care reduces complexities faced by patients.
11851| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Insurance companies often make life as difficult as possible for patients through complicated rules and qualifications.
11852| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer, universal health care results in long waits for patients.
11852| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Canada is a prime example of this.
11853| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Frequent cancellations are a feature of universal health care systems.
11853| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"A function of ""rationing"", doctors sometimes have to cancel visits in a single-payer system."
11854| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Competition in health care is generally a bad idea.
11854| Single-payer universal health care|premise|While competition can make sense when it relates to the production of goods, it is not good when it relates to dealing with human life.
11855| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Competition causes the wasteful duplication of expensive forms of care.
11855| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""When, for example, hospitals compete they often duplicate expensive equipment in order to corner more of the market for lucrative procedure-oriented care."
11856| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer health care erodes competition in price and value.
11856| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The notion of the free markets as a source of efficiency dates back to Adam Smith.
11857| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Governments might attempt to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power.
11857| Single-payer universal health care|premise|For example, governments, such as Canada, have outlawed medical care if the service is paid for by private individual funds.
11858| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care systems are more economically efficient.
11858| Single-payer universal health care|premise|America spends a far higher percentage of GDP on health care than any other country, and has worse ratings on a variety of subjects such as quality of care, efficiency of care, access to care, safe care, equity, right care and wait times according to the commonwealth fund.
11859| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care lowers long-term health costs.
11859| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Universal health care systems better encourage patients to seek preventive care.
11860| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Private healthcare providers are more expensive than public providers.
11860| Single-payer universal health care|premise|They take more money for overhead as well as profit than a public system would.
11861| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer health care gets rid of wasteful middlemen.
11861| Single-payer universal health care|premise|According to an estimate by Dr.
11862| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Cost savings with universal health care will outweigh program costs.
11862| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is important in this analysis to consider that, even if universal health care were to cost more now, that these costs could easily be outweighed by long-term cost-savings.
11863| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Costs are inconsequential if health care is considered a universal right.
11863| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It may very well be true that universal health care increases costs.
11864| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|No universal health care leads to excessive, expensive use of the ER.
11864| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is true that when people do not have health car, they more frequently utilize the ER for care.
11865| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Free health care leads to overuse of medical services and higher costs.
11865| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Whenever something of value is provided free of charge in society, it is used more.
11866| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care can't be reversed even if costs explode.
11866| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"Universal health care, like any government benefit, is eventually going to be interpreted as a ""right"" by the public, making it politically impossible to curtail the program when it becomes too costly."
11867| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer systems create rigid prices unresponsive to shortages/gluts.
11867| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Consider two distinguishing features of socialist economies."
11868| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Aging countries cannot afford universal health care.
11868| Single-payer universal health care|premise|When a country's population ages, the strain of a universal health care program grows, with a larger percentage of the population reaching an age in which they require health care.
11869| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|US has a big bureaucracy now.
11869| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Won’t this just be another bureaucracy? The United States has the most bureaucratic health care system in the world."
11870| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care reduces administrative costs .
11870| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Medical professionals are often challenged with massive amounts of paperwork in private health care systems.
11871| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|A profit health care environment results in more frivolous lawsuits.
11871| Single-payer universal health care|premise|When profits are driving doctors to gave favor to patients with good, private insurance, an environment is created that is prone to lawsuits.
11872| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care creates a big, inefficient bureaucracy.
11872| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The cause of this is greater bureaucratic oversight and more paperwork.
11873| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|The costs of transition to a universal health care program would be large.
11873| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It would involve lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation, among other things.
11874| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care would increase frivolous malpractice lawsuits.
11874| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Malpractice lawsuit costs, which are already sky-high, could further explode since universal care may expose the government to legal liability, and the possibility to sue someone with deep pockets usually invites more lawsuits."
11875| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|The lack of universal health care is a leading cause of bankruptcy.
11875| Single-payer universal health care|premise|A Harvard study indicates that a lack of universal health care is a leading cause in 50% of bankruptcies filed annually in the United States.
11876| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Total costs for individuals would be reduced by universal health care.
11876| Single-payer universal health care|premise|The current US system is already funded 64% by tax money with the remaining 36% split between private and employer spending.
11877| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer health care allows bargaining for lower drug prices.
11877| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""When all patients are under one system, the payer wields a lot of clout."
11878| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care is not free.
11878| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is a myth that universal health care could somehow be free or lower the costs to the patient.
11879| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer systems typically mean higher taxes.
11879| Single-payer universal health care|premise|A country which adopts a totally tax funded socialized form of health care will have to increase the average tax rate by an amount equivalent to the cost of providing health care and administering the system.
11880| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Allowing for pooling of resources to force drugs to lower prices will reduce overall innovation.
11880| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Reducing profit, reduces motive and the money necessary to get a drug through FDA trials.
11881| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Single-payer systems create new job opportunities.
11881| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Many of those working in the private insurance industry can get new jobs in the new public health care industry.
11882| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Many businesses cannot pay the private health insurance of employees.
11882| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Indeed, the Big Three of U.
11883| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|No universal health care causes job lock.
11883| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""“Job lock”: Job lock refers to the idea that people stay with their jobs when they would rather work elsewhere because their current job offers health insurance."
11884| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Free, universal health care would devastate the insurance industry.
11884| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""A long, painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs, business closures, and new patient record creation."
11885| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care risks monopsony.
11885| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Universal health care systems, in an effort to control costs by gaining or enforcing monopsony power, sometimes outlaw medical care paid for by private, individual funds.
11886| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care internationally is better than US system.
11886| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Single-payer and beyond."
11887| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Millions don't have health insurance in US.
11887| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""The number of uninsured citizens has grown to over 40 million."
11888| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Just because Americans are uninsured doesn't mean they can't get health care.
11888| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""Just because Americans are uninsured doesn't mean they can't receive health care; nonprofits and government-run hospitals provide services to those who don't have insurance, and it is illegal to refuse emergency medical service because of a lack of insurance."
11889| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Advanced care improves Americans' chances of surviving cancer.
11889| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"The American Cancer Society notes, ""U."
11890| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|There are many ways to pay for any added costs of universal health care.
11890| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Some proposed means of dealing with these added costs include a cigarette tax and repealing tax cuts for the wealthy.
11891| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Only the government can provide a coherent universal health care system.
11891| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Such a system is important from the standpoint of providing quality care, in that only a standardized system and unified database can enable doctors to treat any patient that comes in front of them.
11892| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|A mixed private-public system would preserve existing industries.
11892| Single-payer universal health care|premise|Any proposal to shift to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry.
11893| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Universal health care makes a centralized national database possible.
11893| Single-payer universal health care|premise|"""We can develop a centralized national database which makes diagnosis and treatment easier for doctors."
11894| Single-payer universal health care|conclusion|Government-control of databases better protect privacy than companies.
11894| Single-payer universal health care|premise|It is important to recognize that this is not a choice between a government-controlled database and no database.
11897| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Single-sex schools allow kids to concentrated on academics.
11897| Single-sex schools|premise|In middle schools today, all kids worry about are how they are going to impress the next girl/boy.
11898| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Women in particular have benefit from single-sex education.
11898| Single-sex schools|premise|Research shows that they participate more in class, develop much higher self-esteem, score higher in aptitude tests, are more likely to choose ‘male’ disciplines such as science in college, and are more successful in their careers.
11899| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Single-sex schools have thrived historically.
11899| Single-sex schools|premise|"A policy update from the National Association of State Boards of Education in 2002, read, ""positive outcomes from single-sex education for both boys and girls, including higher reading and foreign language achievement, less sex-stereotyped course taking patterns, more time spent on homework, higher educational aspirations, and decreased sex-role stereotyping."
11900| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Some studies show single-sex schools do not improve performance.
11900| Single-sex schools|premise|1998 survey from the American Association of University Women, a long-time advocate of single-sex education, admitted that girls from such schools did not in fact show academic improvement.
11901| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Boys and girls distract each other from their education.
11901| Single-sex schools|premise|This is especially true in adolescence as their sexual and emotional sides develop.
11902| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Boys and girls have a good influence on each other's education.
11902| Single-sex schools|premise|They engender good behaviour and maturity – particularly as teenage girls usually exhibit greater responsibility than boys of the same age.
11903| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Female-only schools are a natural extension of feminism.
11903| Single-sex schools|premise|There are co-educational schools, men have had their own schools, why should women not? It would still be discrimination if there were only male single-sex schools; as long as both genders are catered for, this discrimination is redressed.
11904| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Nearly all thriving cultures have had single-sex schooling.
11904| Single-sex schools|premise|"""Surveying how the world's many existing and historical cultures have dealt with the preparation of their youth leads us to the modern relevance of some ancient, tried-and-true practices."
11905| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Single-sex schools are a throwback to the patriarchal cultures.
11905| Single-sex schools|premise|In many historical cultures, only men were allowed an education of any sort.
11906| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Teachers possibly becoming the wrong objects of interest in students.
11906| Single-sex schools|premise|Taking the example of placing a young,beautiful lady teacher in an all boys high school, what do you get when pitting a female teacher with boys in their teens with raging hormones ? Clearly, we can see that the teachers physical statures will obviously distract the class from paying attention to the lecture and instead on the fact the teacher is a potential candidate to court and her physical beauty.
11907| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Teachers often favor own gender in co-educational classes.
11907| Single-sex schools|premise|For example, male teachers can undermine the progress and confidence of girl students by refusing to choose them to answer questions etc.
11908| Single-sex schools|conclusion|Teachers are often discriminated against in single-sex schools.
11908| Single-sex schools|premise|A boys’ school will usually have a largely male staff where women may feel uncomfortable or denied opportunity, and vice versa.
11909| Smoking|conclusion|Cigarettes are harmful.
11909| Smoking|premise|With little doubt that smoking is harmful to individuals, governments should take actions to protect its citizens and ban smoking.
11910| Smoking|conclusion|Smoking is not a real choice, as nicotine is an addictive drug.
11910| Smoking|premise|In fact, recent allegations suggest that tobacco companies deliberately produce the most addictive cigarettes they can.
11911| Smoking|conclusion|Most smokers want to quit.
11911| Smoking|premise|Most smokers say that they want to quit, so further restriction or a ban on tobacco would be doing them a favor.
11912| Smoking|conclusion|Governments must defend freedom of choice to smoke.
11912| Smoking|premise|While a government has a responsibility to protect its population, it also has a responsibility to defend their freedom of choice.
11913| Smoking|conclusion|A comparison of tobacco to hard drugs is inaccurate.
11913| Smoking|premise|Tobacco is not debilitating in the same way that many illegal narcotics may be, nor is it comparable to the likes of heroin in terms of addictiveness, nor is it a mind-altering substance that leads to irrational, violent, or criminal behaviour.
11914| Smoking|conclusion|Many things are addictive.
11914| Smoking|premise|Addiction shouldn't be the major criteria for banning tobacco consumption, because other acceptable products are addictive.
11915| Smoking|conclusion|Cigarette makers should pay a price for creating harmful products.
11915| Smoking|premise|If a company produces food that is poisonous or a car that fails safety tests, the product is immediately taken off the market.
11916| Smoking|conclusion|Cigarettes are very different from dangerous cars or poisonous foods.
11916| Smoking|premise|As the proposition points out, cigarettes are not dangerous because they are defective; rather they are inherently, potentially, harmful.
11917| Smoking|conclusion|Many products are unhealthy.
11917| Smoking|premise|High cholesterol or a high intake of fat can be extremely harmful, leading to heart disease, obesity, and other conditions; but manufacturers of these products are not punished.
11918| Smoking|conclusion|Restricting smoking, done by billions of people, is unreasonable.
11918| Smoking|premise|It would be unreasonable to criminalize an activity indulged in by about one sixth of the world population.
11919| Smoking|conclusion|Smoking forces others to 'passively smoking'.
11919| Smoking|premise|In a smoke-filled environment, non-smokers (family members, colleagues, customers, etc.
11920| Smoking|conclusion|"Evidence about ""passive smoking"" is dubious."
11920| Smoking|premise|Few controlled studies having been carried out.
11921| Smoking|conclusion|"""Passive smoking"" can be reduced without draconian restrictions."
11921| Smoking|premise|It is true that smoke-filled environments can be unpleasant for non-smokers, but there are reasonable and responsible ways around this - smoking rooms in offices and airports are an excellent example.
11923| Smoking|conclusion|Harm of cigarettes are cause enough for restrictions on ads.
11923| Smoking|premise|There should be a ban on all tobacco advertising due to the knowledge of its ill effects.
11924| Smoking|conclusion|Ads do not force people to smoke.
11924| Smoking|premise|There is no good evidence that either of these measures would have an impact on the rate of tobacco consumption.
11925| Smoking|conclusion|Neuromarketing study claims these ads are counterproductive.
11925| Smoking|premise|According to one of the largest neuromarketing studies ever conducted (see the book Buyology or its websites), adverts stating harmfulness of smoking and emphasizing health risks are in fact counterproductive - they effectively activate those parts of brain that trigger craving for cigarettes.
11929| Socialism|conclusion|Genuine socialism has greatly improved societies.
11929| Socialism|premise|One example of this is the Spanish revolution.
11930| Socialism|conclusion|Examples cited as socialism are usually not socialism.
11930| Socialism|premise|Socialism, in it's purest form, means a classless society where everyone owns the means of production.
11931| Socialism|conclusion|Failed attempts at socialism do not disprove its potential.
11931| Socialism|premise|It is incorrect to say something doesn't work just because it doesn't work in one small experiment (i.
11932| Socialism|conclusion|Soviet Union demonstrates failures of socialism.
11932| Socialism|premise|"""Socialism's failure in the former Soviet Union and in the other socialist countries stands as a clear and unquestionable warning as to which path any rational and sane people should never follow again."
11941| Socialism|conclusion|Socialism punishes effort and subsidizes laziness.
11941| Socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""We have a system that increasingly taxes work and subsidizes nonwork."
11942| Socialism|conclusion|Socialism wrongly labels wanting and ambition as wrong.
11942| Socialism|premise|"The behavioral schema that was all-too-common in  was like follows: ""You will not want anything from me, I will not want anything from you, and we will all solidarily wait until the end of the working hours""."
11947| Socialism|conclusion|Capitalism has fostered imperialism, exploitation, and suffering.
11947| Socialism|premise|The economic rational behind this is simple.
11952| Socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is more successful than socialism historically.
11952| Socialism|premise|"""Earlier in this century, the Austrian economists demonstrated that socialist planning would fail."
11956| Socialism|conclusion|Socialism wrongly incites antagonism between classes.
11956| Socialism|premise|"""2."
11957| Socialism|conclusion|Capitalism is necessary condition for political freedom.
11957| Socialism|premise|"Milton Friedman: ""History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom."
11965| Social networking sites|conclusion|Social networking sites estrange people.
11965| Social networking sites|premise|Social networking sites risk to diminish the value of friendship, by presenting friendship only with its utility meaning.
11966| Social networking sites|conclusion|Social networking sites create great opportunities for professional networking.
11966| Social networking sites|premise|"Since ""it's not what you know, but who you know"", this is very important."
11967| Social networking sites|conclusion|Social networking sites enable individuals to move toward making face-to-face meetings.
11967| Social networking sites|premise|Social networking sites are a starting place for face-to-face meetings between professionals.
11968| Social networking sites|conclusion|Social networking sites do not allow for trusting professional relationships to be established.
11968| Social networking sites|premise|Face-to-face conversations and hand-shakes are still the most important element of sound professional networking.

11976| Solar energy|premise|Coal is the primary fuel for generating electricity around the world.
11977| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar cell production requires significant energy, adds emissions.
11977| Solar energy|premise|The most commonly used material in photovoltaic solar energy systems is crystalline silicon.
11978| Solar energy|conclusion|Inconsistent solar energy requires back-up sources .
11978| Solar energy|premise|Because solar energy cannot supply energy at night and is dependent on good weather, it requires back-up sources of energy to fill the gaps.
11979| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar energy does not damage air quality.
11979| Solar energy|premise|It does not pollute our air by releasing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide or mercury into the atmosphere like many traditional forms of electrical generation.

11982| Solar energy|premise|Solar panals can be put in the middle of the desert, to avoid clearing rainforests and arable land.
11983| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar panels contain cadmium, which is environmentally hazardous.
11983| Solar energy|premise|Solar panels themselves contain cadmium, a silvery metal that is toxic in the environment.
11984| Solar energy|conclusion|Land-intensive solar power incentivizes clearing land, ecosystems.
11984| Solar energy|premise|Because the sun's rays are diffuse, solar panels must occupy substantial territory to generate any significant quantities of power.
11985| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar energy uses less land than coal.
11985| Solar energy|premise|"""Nevada Solar One takes up about 400 acres, mostly for mirrors and heat engines."
11986| Solar energy|conclusion|Decentralized solar power does not take up much land.
11986| Solar energy|premise|Solar power is not the same as coal, nuclear, or other forms of energy where large-scale industrial plants are created.
11987| Solar energy|conclusion|Deserts are possibly suitable for the deployment of solar farms.
11987| Solar energy|premise|Covering only a fraction of the area of deserts with solar cells with moderate efficiency would provide enough energy for world's energy needs.
11988| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar energy requires too much land, damaging the environment.
11988| Solar energy|premise|The sun light and its energy hit the earth's surface in a diffuse manner.
11989| Solar energy|conclusion|The disposal of solar energy batteries can be regulated.
11989| Solar energy|premise|While batteries can pose an environmental risk, it is very simple to impose disposal regulations on the suppliers and users of solar energy systems.
11990| Solar energy|conclusion|Long-life of solar energy systems reduce battery disposal.
11990| Solar energy|premise|The disposal of batteries is very infrequent with solar energy because these batteries and solar energy systems last for so long, which is partly a function of the fact that solar energy involves no moving parts.
11991| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar power is intermittent so must be stored.
11991| Solar energy|premise|Because solar energy doesn't produce at night and is dependent on good weather, it produces in fits and starts.
11992| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar power stores energy in environmentally hazardous batteries.

11994| Solar energy|conclusion|Many solar energy systems are now price competitive with coal.
11994| Solar energy|premise|"""Is it possible that solar power will be more cost effective than coal in 12 years? It seems like a pipe dream, but the US government along with huge investors like Goldman Sachs, Chevron, and Google seem to think it's a little better than just a distant possibility."
11995| Solar energy|conclusion|High oil prices make solar more competitive.
11995| Solar energy|premise|High oil prices in recent years have made solar power much more price competitive.

11999| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar energy panels can be added to meet growing needs.
11999| Solar energy|premise|If a household or business demands more energy, it can always adds solar panels.
12000| Solar energy|conclusion|Solar energy creates interesting employment opportunities.
12000| Solar energy|premise|The employment opportunities created by solar power are interesting because they involve a high degree of interaction between the employee and communities that are demanding solar energy.
12001| Solar energy|conclusion|"Sunlight is relatively weak energy source because rays are ""diluted""."
12001| Solar energy|premise|"Compared to fossil fuels, sunlight is a weak energy source because the radiation strength is ""diluted"" by the time the rays reach earth."

12137| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates are representative since most are democratically elected.
12137| Superdelegates|premise|Many argue that the superdelegate system is undemocratic because superdelegates are not bound to vote in accordance with the electotrate's will.
12138| Superdelegates|conclusion|"Superdelegates are more ""in touch"" with issues/voters than delegates."
12138| Superdelegates|premise|Superdelegates are more in touch with their electorates and the issues that surround them than the voters themselves.
12141| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates provide greater mainstream party representation.
12141| Superdelegates|premise|Party activists, who more frequently seek to become delegates, are generally more liberal or conservative than the base of their parties.
12142| Superdelegates|conclusion|"""Undemocratic"" superdelegates are only 20% of total number of delegates."
12142| Superdelegates|premise|The delegates picked by voters take up more than 80 percent of the whole; the superdelegates, make up the rest.
12143| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates would be meaningless if they had to vote with electorate.
12143| Superdelegates|premise|Superdelegates were not created to simply follow the will of the electorate.
12144| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates have the people's interests at heart.
12144| Superdelegates|premise|While superdelegates are often antagonized as old party establishment and closed-door dealers, they are actually typically well-intentioned public servants that have the interests of their constituents, democracy, and the future of their party at heart.
12145| Superdelegates|conclusion|How superdelegates should vote with popular will is unclear.
12145| Superdelegates|premise|Should superdelegates vote according to their constituents, the constituents of their state, or by the national will? There is not established guideline for superdelegates as far as voting according to popular will.
12146| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates violate the principal of one person one vote.
12146| Superdelegates|premise|The votes of citizens should all count equally.
12147| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates should follow the will of the voters.
12147| Superdelegates|premise|This is a necessary element of upholding the impression that the voters' voices are being fully considered and that the primary elections are fully democratic.
12148| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates are wrongly committing before voting is done.
12148| Superdelegates|premise|This argument generally rests on the notion that voters should decide the direction of elections, and that superdelegates are primarily responsible for flocking to the support of the candidate that the voters select.
12149| Superdelegates|conclusion|Voters should be fully empowered to choose primary nominee.
12149| Superdelegates|premise|It is true that political parties are currently given the power to choose the nominee that they desire through a process largely of their choosing, in accordance with the right to association laws.
12150| Superdelegates|conclusion|The US superdelegate system is undemocratic.
12150| Superdelegates|premise|Superdelegates are not obligated to vote according to popular will for the Democratic nominee, as are other delegates.
12151| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates have too much power relative to ordinary voters.
12151| Superdelegates|premise|The average superelegate's individual vote counts as much as the vote of over 10,000 ordinary citizens.
12152| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates strike a nerve after 2000 Bush-Gore elections.
12152| Superdelegates|premise|The 2000 Florida Supreme court decision that gave George Bush the presidency over Al Gore undermined, for many people, confidence in the democratic nature of the electoral process.
12153| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates were not elected or appointed to elect presidential nominee.
12153| Superdelegates|premise|Superdelegates are a group of Representatives, Senators, governors, party members and ex-officials, these folks represent 20% of all the delegates needed to be nominated but are not bound to vote according to any constituency.
12154| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates are inappropriate following democracy-snubbing Bush era.
12154| Superdelegates|premise|Many citizens feel that the Bush administration was overly secretive and undemocratic.
12155| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates represent old era of closed-door politics.
12155| Superdelegates|premise|The superdelegate system reminds many citizens of the old political system of closed-door politics.
12156| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates are life-long party leaders that deserve more power.
12156| Superdelegates|premise|It seems appropriate that life-long party leaders might have greater voting power than ordinary citizens in the nomination of a presidential candidate.
12158| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates should vote their beliefs, not according to popular vote.
12158| Superdelegates|premise|The superdelegate system was created in 1984 with the intent for superdelegates to vote their minds.
12161| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates are the ultimate protectors.
12161| Superdelegates|premise|Superdelegates are those who cared about the party and its standing beyond a single election or a single candidate.
12162| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates provide unifying margin of victory in tight race.
12162| Superdelegates|premise|When one candidate has secured an adequate lead, even if marginal, superdelegates play an important role in converging in support of the victor.
12163| Superdelegates|conclusion|Walter Mondale's 1984 election shows risks of superdelegate nominees.
12163| Superdelegates|premise|The superdelegate system was first instituted in the 1984 Democracy primary elections in which Walter Mondale became the Democratic nominee against Ronald Reagan in the general election.
12165| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates often vote out of self-interest for likely winner.
12165| Superdelegates|premise|While some argue that it is good for superdelegates to vote according to their own beliefs because this might keep nominees more consistent with the Party-agenda, there is reason to believe that superdelegates are not voting according to their own concience and interpretation of the party agenda.
12167| Superdelegates|conclusion|Candidate solicitations of superdelegates damage the political process.
12167| Superdelegates|premise|Candidates have been aggressively soliciting superdelegates for their support.
12168| Superdelegates|conclusion|The superdelegate system is superfluous.
12168| Superdelegates|premise|If superdelegates are voting according to popular opinion, as some suggest, and which might be the only fairly democratic system, then they actually become completely pointless.
12169| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates help increase the likelihood of a Democratic presidency.
12169| Superdelegates|premise|Superdelegates are senior party members that understand better than anyone else what is required to win in the general election.
12171| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates are ideal primary election tie-breakers.
12171| Superdelegates|premise|If voters split equally between two Democratic candidates, how should the tie be resolved? Superdelegates, as the leadership of the party, are as good a tie-breaking mechanism as any.
12172| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates may discourage future political participation.
12172| Superdelegates|premise|If the perception builds that primary elections are decided in large part in back-room dealings, voters may feel alienated and discouraged from participating in future elections.
12173| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegates represent party-leadership at national convention.
12173| Superdelegates|premise|One of the concerns that led to the creation of the superdelegate system was that the party leadership was not effectively represented at the national convention.
12174| Superdelegates|conclusion|Superdelegate placement at national convention should not be a major consideration.
12174| Superdelegates|premise|The superdelegate system should not exist simply to send party leaders to the national convention.
12175| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|Surrogacy brings parenthood to couples unable of have children of their own.
12175| Surrogate mothers|premise|This is either due to biological circumstances ( for example infertile or same-sex couples ), or the unavailability of a child for adoption.
12176| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|Parenthood, through surrogacy, is not a fundamental right.
12176| Surrogate mothers|premise|Contrary to the assumptions that underlie the proposition case, parenthood is not a fundamental human right.
12177| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|Surrogacy need not involve money payments of any kind.
12177| Surrogate mothers|premise|Even if commercialisation does occur, it would be controlled by strict laws and regulated by independent bodies, as is currently the case in the US.
12178| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|Surrogacy is not inherently exploitative.
12178| Surrogate mothers|premise|"The argument that surrogacy is exploitative rests primarily on the economic conditions of a woman that might cause her to ""involuntarily"" offer her body in surrogacy in exchange for money."
12179| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|Surrogacy will inevitably become commercial.
12179| Surrogate mothers|premise|If there is a demand for surrogacy, there is little doubt that it will be commercialized by those looking to turn a profit on the practice.
12180| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|Commercial surrogacy is exploitative.
12180| Surrogate mothers|premise|Commercial surrogacy would involve women ‘hiring out’ their wombs to the highest bidder.
12181| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|Commercialize surrogacy will benefit the rich more than the poor.
12181| Surrogate mothers|premise|Even if charges are standardized, the high level of such a fee will still ensure that the rich are more likely to benefit than the poor, as they are more likely to be able to afford the cost.
12182| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|"Surrogate mothers could be ""a friend of the family"" to avoid payments."
12182| Surrogate mothers|premise|This could help avoiding any legal wrangling after the birth, which can often happen when strangers are involved.
12183| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|"It is a bad idea for surrogate mothers to be ""friends of the family""."
12183| Surrogate mothers|premise|This arrangement would in fact create more problems than it solved, as such an unofficial arrangement would be a legal nightmare if the surrogate decided ( as has often happened ) to keep the baby, as she would of course be the child’s legal mother.
12184| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|On a practical note, no law against surrogacy could be enforced properly.
12184| Surrogate mothers|premise|It would merely lead to the physical impregnation of the surrogate by the would-be father, rather than a clean surgical procedure that avoided the emotional problems caused by an actual sexual act between the surrogate and the would-be father.
12185| Surrogate mothers|conclusion|The difficulty of enforcing surrogacy laws does not justify abandoning them.
12185| Surrogate mothers|premise|Even if there would be problems in enforcing a ban, we should still lay down the law; such an argument used against, say, growing cannabis at home would not invalidate a ban on drugs.
12186| Taiwan independence|conclusion|Independence is more politically possible in modern Taiwan.
12186| Taiwan independence|premise|Political liberalization and the increased representation of opposition parties in Taiwan's legislature have opened public debate on the island's future; advocates of Taiwanese independence oppose the ruling party's traditional stand that the island will eventually reunify with mainland China.
12187| Taiwan independence|conclusion|The stand of the ruling party has been that Taiwan will eventually unify with China.

12188| Taiwan independence|premise|Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8% during the past three decades.
12189| Taiwan independence|conclusion|A move to independence would cause China to severely punish Taiwan's economy.
12189| Taiwan independence|premise|Taiwan might have a strong economy now, but the real question is whether they will be able to maintain this economy in the face of attack from China.
12190| Taiwan independence|conclusion|Taiwan's own military capabilities provide a substantial deterrent against a Chinese invasion.
12190| Taiwan independence|premise|Taiwan has a strong military of its own, with 6,554,373 conscripts available on call and a budget of US$8.
12191| Taiwan independence|conclusion|The US support of Taiwan provides a substantial detterrent against a Chinese invastion.
12191| Taiwan independence|premise|When China was launching missiles into the Taiwan Straits in 1996, the US sent aircraft carriers to protect them.
12192| Taiwan independence|conclusion|China has consistently maintained that if Taiwan declares independence it will declare war.
12192| Taiwan independence|premise|When President Lee merely suggested having ‘state to state relations’ they started launching missiles into the Taiwan Straits.
12193| Taiwan independence|conclusion|The US may not come to Taiwan's aid.
12193| Taiwan independence|premise|The US does not have any official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.

12203| Teacher-student friendships on Facebook|premise|"Josh Wolford at WebProNews: ""Let's be honest, social media is a liability."
12204| Teacher-student friendships on Facebook|conclusion|Facebook law assumes worse about teachers.
12204| Teacher-student friendships on Facebook|premise|"Christine Greenhow, an assistant professor at the College of Education and the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland: ""It seems to assume the worst about teachers, that teachers are sexual predators."
12205| Teacher-student friendships on Facebook|conclusion|Facebook law will hardly impact online/sexual abuse.

12209| Teacher-student friendships on Facebook|premise|While some think that the Facebook law unfairly puts teachers in a negative light, parents are not being irrational in worrying about a teacher potentially taking advantage of students.

12465| Tibet independence|premise|During this period, no country gave Tibet diplomatic recognition.
12466| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Tibetan independence movement has been driven in history by a malicious Western imperialist campaign against China.
12466| Tibet independence|premise|The PRC considers all movements aimed at ending Chinese sovereignty in Tibet, starting with British attempts in the late 19th century and early 20th century, to the CTA today, as one long campaign abetted by malicious Western imperialism aimed at destroying Chinese integrity and sovereignty, thereby weakening China's position in the world.
12469| Tibet independence|conclusion|In 821, China and Tibet agreed to respect each other's sovereignty.
12469| Tibet independence|premise|In 821, after centuries of periodic fighting, China and Tibet signed a treaty where boundaries were confirmed, and each country promised respect for the other's territorial sovereignty.
12470| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Atlas of Chinese History Maps depicts Tibet as an independent country before 1280.
12470| Tibet independence|premise|These maps were published by Chinese Social Science Institute in Beijing.
12471| Tibet independence|conclusion|During the Tang Dynasty, close social and economic relations were built between the Tibetans and the Hans.
12471| Tibet independence|premise|In the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the Tibetans and Hans Chinese began a path toward unification.
12472| Tibet independence|conclusion|Agreement of 821 is signal of Tibet unification with China.
12472| Tibet independence|premise|"""The Tang-Tubo Alliance Monument erected in 823 still stands in the square in front of the Jokhang Monastery."
12473| Tibet independence|conclusion|Between the 13th and 14th centuries Tibet was under Mongol not Chinese rule.
12473| Tibet independence|premise|During this period, the Mongol leader, Genghis Khan, conquered most of Eurasia including China.
12474| Tibet independence|conclusion|Mongolia gave diplomatic recognition to the Tibetan state in 1207.
12474| Tibet independence|premise|Prior to the Mongol invasions, the Mongols actually recognized Tibet as a state that was independent from China.
12475| Tibet independence|conclusion|Even during the periods of nominal subjugation to the Mongol and Qing Empires, Tibet was largely self-governing.
12475| Tibet independence|premise|A continues show of Tibetan autonomy through its history, even during the Mongol invasions, demonstrates its rightful historical claim to independence.
12476| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet has been part of China since 13th century Mongol invasions.
12476| Tibet independence|premise|In the past 700 years, subsequent Chinese governments - Ming Dynasty, Qing Dynasty, Republic of China, and People's Republic of China - have all succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty and de facto power over Tibet.
12477| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Ming Dynasty  did not actually rule Tibet.
12477| Tibet independence|premise|"""The Ming Dynasty, which ruled China from 1368 to 1644, had few ties to and no authority over Tibet."
12479| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Qing Emperor accepted The Fifth Dalai Lama in 1652 as the leader of an independent Tibet.
12479| Tibet independence|premise|The Emperor also treated Him as Divinity on Earth.
12480| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet had only satellite relationship with the Manchus .
12480| Tibet independence|premise|"""During the Manchu rule (1644-1911), the Qing army was asked by Tibetans to settle disputes."
12481| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet waged war in the 19th century independent from China.
12481| Tibet independence|premise|Although supporters of an independent Tibet concede Chinese influence increased during the Qing dynasty, they point out that Tibet waged war against Jammu in 1841-1842 and with Nepal in 1854-55 without Chinese assistance.
12482| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Qing Dynasty handled Tibetan affairs on behalf of the Central Government.
12482| Tibet independence|premise|When the Qing Dynasty 1644-1911 replaced the Ming Dynasty in 1644, it further strengthened administration over Tibet.
12498| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet recognized at Geneva conventions after WWII.
12498| Tibet independence|premise|"""It should be noted that numerous countries made statements in the course of UN General Assembly debates following the invasion of Tibet that reflected their recognition of Tibet's independent status."
12500| Tibet independence|conclusion|In a multicultural society, Tibet's uniqueness does not warrant independence.
12500| Tibet independence|premise|China has many different groups with many different historical, cultural, geographic, and linguistic characteristics.
12501| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibetans should not accentuate differences and create prejudices pursuing independence.
12501| Tibet independence|premise|Even if Tibet has certain unique distinctions over most of these other minority groups, it is unclear why this should warrant their independence.
12502| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibetans have the right to self-determination, and the right to choose independence.
12502| Tibet independence|premise|The right to self-determination is universally held, and protected under international law.
12503| Tibet independence|conclusion|The majority of Tibetans desire independence.
12503| Tibet independence|premise|The majority of Tibetans believe the Chinese government is depriving them of essential freedoms, and would vote for independence if it was put to a referendum.
12504| Tibet independence|conclusion|The principles of Tibet independence should be considered outside of the context of other separatist movements.
12504| Tibet independence|premise|One main argument against Tibetan independence is that it risks encouraging other separatist movements, be they in Taiwan, Chechnya, Kosovo, or elsewhere.
12505| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Tibetan case for independence is analogous to US rationales for independence in 1776.
12505| Tibet independence|premise|It is important to put Tibet's struggle for independence in historical perspective in this way.
12506| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet's case for independence is equally justified as Kosovo's case.
12506| Tibet independence|premise|On February 18th, 2008, Kosovo declared itself independent from Serbia.
12507| Tibet independence|conclusion|The average Tibetan does not actually want independence from China.
12507| Tibet independence|premise|Certainly, many Tibetans want independence and are protesting in favor of it.
12508| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Chinese government has a right to protect the unity of China against Tibetan separatism.
12508| Tibet independence|premise|"US President Abraham Lincoln, in justifying efforts to maintain the union in the face of an imminent civil war, said in 1858, ""A house divided cannot stand""."
12509| Tibet independence|conclusion|China already offers Tibet a right to self-determination with a level of autonomy.
12509| Tibet independence|premise|"Self-determination does not mean ""independence"", outright."
12510| Tibet independence|conclusion|The right to self-determination must be offered sparingly to avoid international instability.
12510| Tibet independence|premise|Any right to self-determination cannot be offered liberally in the international system.
12511| Tibet independence|conclusion|A right to self-determination should only be offered for especially grievous circumstances, which does not include Tibet.
12511| Tibet independence|premise|While Tibet may have good reasons to complain about its circumstances under China, its circumstances are not that bad.
12512| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibetan exiles forgo any right to self-determination by acting violently and repressively.
12512| Tibet independence|premise|Self-determination is a right as well as a privilege.
12513| Tibet independence|conclusion|China's invasion of Tibet invalidates its right to govern it.
12513| Tibet independence|premise|"""whenever it is determined that genocide has been perpetrated against a people, there should be a concomitant right to secession exercisable at its option."
12514| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Chinese government is not working toward solutions for Tibet.
12514| Tibet independence|premise|"""Proving Truth from Facts""."
12515| Tibet independence|conclusion|China focuses great attention on developing Tibet.
12515| Tibet independence|premise|"""The Chinese central government always attaches great importance to the work in Tibet, having held four working conferences on Tibet since the start of reform and opening-up policy at the end of 1970s, and formulated a series of favorable and supportive policies to accelerate the economic development there and maintain stability."
12516| Tibet independence|conclusion|By liberating Tibet, China safeguarded its sovereign and territorial integrity.
12516| Tibet independence|premise|With rampant Western imperialism following the end of WWII, protecting Tibet from such imperialism was very important.
12517| Tibet independence|conclusion|Chinese policies have been ethnically reconciliatory.
12517| Tibet independence|premise|There have been instances where Chinese authorities have pursued engagement policies with Tibet on a political and economic level.
12518| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Chinese authorities have had numerous proactive measure to reach out to Tibet.
12518| Tibet independence|premise|Economic and legal benefits have been granted to Tibetans in an effort of the Chinese authorities to spur development of teh area and increase the welfare of Tibetans.
12519| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibetan's independence protests have determined the Chinese to change their approach.
12519| Tibet independence|premise|The change in the policies that Chinese authorities have pursued towards Tibet has been determined by pro-independence protests.
12520| Tibet independence|conclusion|China has not swamped Tibetans with Han Chinese immigrants.
12520| Tibet independence|premise|Pro-Tibetans often cite the rise in Tibet's population after 1950 as a result of a Chinese policy to swamp Tibetans with Han Chinese immigrants.
12522| Tibet independence|conclusion|Military of Tibet oppresses Tibetans.
12522| Tibet independence|premise|"""Chinese control in Tibet has been and continues to be maintained by a large military force."
12523| Tibet independence|conclusion|China's military is in Tibet due to the separatist threat there.
12523| Tibet independence|premise|China's military presence in Tibet is a justified response to a serious separatist threat both inside of Tibet and from the Tibetan Government in Exile in India.
12524| Tibet independence|conclusion|China is a communist nation, so inherently suppresses Tibetan rights.
12524| Tibet independence|premise|It should not be ignored that China is a communist nation.
12525| Tibet independence|conclusion|China continues to arrest and hold Tibetan political prisoners.
12525| Tibet independence|premise|"""The use of detention, arrest and imprisonment of large numbers of Tibetans continues to be an integral part of China's effort to suppress opposition to Chinese rule in Tibet."
12526| Tibet independence|conclusion|China is engaging in torture in Tibet.
12526| Tibet independence|premise|"""In November 2005 the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Dr Manfred Nowak, visited China and Tibet."
12527| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Chinese government has restricted media access in Tibet.
12527| Tibet independence|premise|During the 2008 unrest in Tibet, Chinese authorities restricted the ability of foreign and Hong Kong media to enter and freely report on the region, with the exception of James Miles, a correspondent from The Economist, who gained approval for a week-long trip which happened to coincide with the increase in tensions.
12528| Tibet independence|conclusion|China suppresses all political protest in Tibet.
12528| Tibet independence|premise|China brutally suppresses Tibetan protests on the grounds that they are crimes of counter-revolution.
12529| Tibet independence|conclusion|China has given Tibet autonomy and democratic representation.
12529| Tibet independence|premise|"""V."
12531| Tibet independence|conclusion|China has no right to keep Tibet while depriving it of its natural leader, the Dalai Lama.
12531| Tibet independence|premise|The Dalai Lama is the spiritual figure-head and historical leader of the Tibetan people.
12534| Tibet independence|conclusion|China substantially improved Tibet's educational system.
12534| Tibet independence|premise|A secular education in the region was created after integration into the PRC; there are 25 scientific research institutes, all built by the PRC.
12536| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibetan students are forced to use Chinese as the official language.
12536| Tibet independence|premise|"February 2008 Norman Baker UK MP, released a statement to mark International Mother Language Day saying - ""The Chinese government are following a deliberate policy of extinguishing all that is Tibetan, including their own language in their own country."
12537| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibetan students are being taught false history.
12537| Tibet independence|premise|The culture of a people is preserved in large part through the transmission of its history through each successive generation.
12538| Tibet independence|conclusion|Protecting Tibetan culture by opposing modernization is wrongheaded.
12538| Tibet independence|premise|"""there is the desire to save Tibet from anything that looks or smells modern: from Chinese jobs, industry, railways."
12539| Tibet independence|conclusion|China actively upholds Tibetan culture.
12539| Tibet independence|premise|Allocation of 300 million Renminbi since the 1980s to the maintenance and protection of Tibetan monasteries.
12540| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Cultural Revolution's cultural damage has been condemned by China in Tibet as in the rest of China.
12540| Tibet independence|premise|The damage it wrought upon the entire PRC is generally condemned as a nationwide catastrophe, whose main instigators (in the PRC's view, the Gang of Four) have been brought to justice and whose reoccurrence is unthinkable in an increasingly modernized China.
12541| Tibet independence|conclusion|China has adopted several policies aimed at honoring and protecting the traditional culture of Tibet.
12541| Tibet independence|premise|"""Tibet has a rich traditional culture which covers language, literature, art, philosophy, religion, medicine and the celestial almanac."
12542| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet independence will ensure that Tibetans fairly benefit from economic gains.
12542| Tibet independence|premise|Tibet has not been given a fair share of its own economic gains? Chinese, government-owned companies have reaped most of the profit from Tibet.
12543| Tibet independence|conclusion|China's development aid to Tibet only consolidates its control.
12543| Tibet independence|premise|Economic development projects, such as the China Western Development economic plan, or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically-motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans.
12545| Tibet independence|conclusion|China cannot be expected to have already fixed Tibet.
12545| Tibet independence|premise|China has done the best it could with Tibet's backwards economic, political system.
12546| Tibet independence|conclusion|China continues to improve on its failures.
12546| Tibet independence|premise|China has failed in some ways for sure.
12547| Tibet independence|conclusion|China's economic modernization of Tibet has improved living standards.
12547| Tibet independence|premise|The lives of Tibetans have been improved immensely compared to the Dalai Lama's rule before 1950.
12548| Tibet independence|conclusion|China is providing enhanced subsidies and assistance to Tibet.
12548| Tibet independence|premise|Tibet receives special attention, care, and economic aid from the Chinese government.
12549| Tibet independence|conclusion|China's militarization of Tibet is damaging its environment.
12549| Tibet independence|premise|"""Proving Truth from Facts""."
12551| Tibet independence|conclusion|Chinese expansion in Tibet is a real threat to the Tibetans.
12551| Tibet independence|premise|China has adopted an aggressive demographic policy in Tibet, moving Chinese into the region, with the implicit objective of making it more difficult for Tibet to declare and achieve independence.
12553| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Tibetan Government in Exile has strong democratic designs for Tibet.
12553| Tibet independence|premise|"""Soon after his arrival in India, the Dalai Lama set up the Government-in-Exile and a series of democratic changes was initiated."
12554| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Central Tibetan Administration renounced Arunachal Pradesh, damaging its moral legitimacy to govern.
12554| Tibet independence|premise|The Arunachal Pradesh is claimed by China as a part of Tibet occupied by India.
12556| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Chinese government has been abusive in policing Tibet.
12556| Tibet independence|premise|"""the present situation, in reality, I think that 99% of the Tibetan population is very, very unhappy."
12557| Tibet independence|conclusion|China unjustly and brutally expelled Tibetan officials when it invaded.
12557| Tibet independence|premise|China has performed many human rights abuses against Tibet and does not deserve to be in control of the country.
12558| Tibet independence|conclusion|China not only attacks Tibet, it also attacks people who diagree with Chinese policy.
12558| Tibet independence|premise|China has got a reputation on doing bad things to people who disagree with their policies, whether they are Chinese or not.
12559| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet has violated human rights, so may abuses by China shouldn't be held to a double standard.
12559| Tibet independence|premise|Tibetan authority under successive Dalai Lamas was itself a human rights violator while the old society was basically a serfdom and, according to foreigners who witnessed it, slaves even existed .
12560| Tibet independence|conclusion|The International Commission of Jurists concluded that Tibet in 1913-50 demonstrated the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law.
12560| Tibet independence|premise|In the opinion of the commission, the government of Tibet conducted its own domestic and foreign affairs free from any outside authority, and countries with whom Tibet had foreign relations are shown by official documents to have treated Tibet in practice as an independent State.
12562| Tibet independence|conclusion|China has ensured that Tibet's economic progress mainly benefits China.
12562| Tibet independence|premise|Chinese companies are investing in Tibet, but these Chinese owners are the primary beneficiaries of these investments.
12563| Tibet independence|conclusion|Independence would allow Tibet to tailor its economic policies to its particular economy.
12563| Tibet independence|premise|Tibet is less developed than China and is less export driven.
12564| Tibet independence|conclusion|Economic independence from China will prevent economic corruption.
12564| Tibet independence|premise|China's economic system is fairly corrupt, particularly in the way that it relates to the communist party.
12565| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet will modernize only if it remains part of China.
12565| Tibet independence|premise|"""As far as the future is concerned, look at the European Union."
12566| Tibet independence|conclusion|An independent Tibet would bring to power a repressive Buddhist theocracy.
12566| Tibet independence|premise|"The Tibetologist Robert Barnett wrote about the violent tendencies of powerful monks against the introduction of anything un-Buddhist that might diminish their hold to power: ""The clergy who destroyed the attempts of the Tibetan government and the previous Dalai Lama to enlarge and modernize the Tibetan army in the 1920s."
12567| Tibet independence|conclusion|No country publicly recognizes Tibet as an independent state.
12567| Tibet independence|premise|For its part, the Government of the United States has borne in mind the fact that.
12568| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibetans lack a unified voice and leadership structure.
12568| Tibet independence|premise|That the Dalai Lama calls for autonomy and rejects independence, while other Tibetans call for independence provides a glimpse of the problem.
12569| Tibet independence|conclusion|China's population strongly opposes Tibet independence.
12569| Tibet independence|premise|"""on this issue, the communist regime is not in opposition to its people."
12570| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet's independence cause enjoys substantial legitimacy in the world.
12570| Tibet independence|premise|"""China is not the Soviet Union or Indonesia, but then, Tibet is not Lithuania or East Timor because Tibet’s cause enjoys even greater prominence and legitimacy for much of the world."
12571| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet can follow the East Timor model to achieving independence.
12571| Tibet independence|premise|"""China also has deep structural problems such as an inflexible political system, growing economic inequality, rampant corruption and pollution, spreading protests and disorder, and unstable nationalism directed against Taiwan, Japan, and the U."
12572| Tibet independence|conclusion|The Dalai Lama is not for independence.
12572| Tibet independence|premise|The Dalai Lama is a key figure and you could almost say is the most influencial person in Tibet.
12573| Tibet independence|conclusion|The US will not jeopardize trade with China to support a Tibet independence.
12573| Tibet independence|premise|"""Becoming more and more dependent on Chinese import United States will not support Tibet independence."
12574| Tibet independence|conclusion|India will not support Tibet Independence out of fear of encouraging separatists in India.
12574| Tibet independence|premise|"""Fearing separatist movements on its own territory India will block Tibet independence as it already happened in the past."
12575| Tibet independence|conclusion|China's permanent membership on the UN Security Council gives it substantial leverage against Tibetan independence.
12575| Tibet independence|premise|"""4."
12576| Tibet independence|conclusion|China is highly unlikely to agree to any negotiations without ruling out Tibet independence.
12576| Tibet independence|premise|"""It is extremely unlikely China would agree to any negotiations unless, as a pre-condition, independence was ruled out."
12577| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet independence would reduce the risks of Tibetan refugee crises.
12577| Tibet independence|premise|In 2008, Tibetans, angry about their treatment under China's rule, spoke out in protest.
12578| Tibet independence|conclusion|Tibet independence would end international protests and diplomatic tensions.
12578| Tibet independence|premise|This caused international outrage, protests, and diplomatic strains.
12579| Tibet independence|conclusion|It would be good for the world for other legitimate secessionist movements to succeed in achieving independence.
12579| Tibet independence|premise|In history, and especially in the 20th century, states have established independence for good reason and with positive effect on the international system.
12580| Tibet independence|conclusion|Foreign powers are simply meddling in China through Tibet.
12580| Tibet independence|premise|Finally, the PRC considers all pro-independence movements aimed at ending Chinese sovereignty in Tibet, including British attempts to establish control in the late 19th century and early 20th century , the CIA's backing of Tibetan insurgents during the 1950s and 1960s,  and the Government of Tibet in Exile today,  as one long campaign abetted by malicious Western imperialism aimed at destroying Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty, or destabilizing China, thereby weakening China's position in the world .
12581| Tibet independence|conclusion|There have been protests on nearly every leg of the Olympic torch relay.
12581| Tibet independence|premise|The Olympic torch relay has been to many major cities including Paris and San Fransisco and each leg of the relay, there have been protests against China taking over Tibet.
12582| Tibet independence|conclusion|The United Nations does charter discourages disruptions of national unity such as a move to Tibetan Independence.
12582| Tibet independence|premise|"The Chinese government insists that the United Nations documents, which codifies the principle of self-determination, provides that the principle shall not be abused in disrupting territorial integrity: ""Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
12585| Tibet independence|conclusion|If Tibetans accept autonomy, they will close the door to independence in the future.
12585| Tibet independence|premise|"""Communist Chinese for an official agreement to have autonomous status for Tibet, we will be surrendering many of the rights we are now entitled to""and locking ourselves into a constricted and precarious situation forever from which we cannot withdraw."
12586| Tibet independence|conclusion|Greater autonomy for Tibet is more realistic than independence.
12586| Tibet independence|premise|"Some point to China's claim that Tibet is already ""autonomous"" as some kind of a sign that greater autonomy is impossible and that independence is, therefore, more feasible."
12587| Ticket scalping|conclusion|Scalpers help sell tickets to those that want them most.
12587| Ticket scalping|premise|Scalpers reflect the broader nature of the markets, helping sell tickets at a price that ensures that only those that want tickets the most are going to get them.
12588| Ticket scalping|conclusion|Scalpers keep supply low, prices high, by tearing up tickets.
12588| Ticket scalping|premise|"For the scalpers' business to work, they will often need to limit the supply of tickets—and tear up the extras instead of selling them at face value: ""If more of the tickets are purchased by ticket scalping enterprises, there are fewer and fewer seats left for those who try to purchase their tickets legitimately."
12589| Tidal energy|conclusion|Environmental-soundness of tidal energy varies.
12589| Tidal energy|premise|"""The few studies that have been undertaken to date to identify the environmental impacts of a tidal power scheme have determined that each specific site is different and the impacts depend greatly upon local geography."
12590| Tidal energy|conclusion|Regulations can minimize environmental impact of tidal energy.
12590| Tidal energy|premise|Many forms of energy have potential environmental impacts.
12591| Tidal energy|conclusion|Insufficient for tidal energy to reduce tides by 15c.
12591| Tidal energy|premise|"""It has been estimated that in the Bay of Fundy, tidal power plants could decrease local tides by 15 cm."
12592| Tidal energy|conclusion|A tidal barrage can safeguard coastlines from storms.
12592| Tidal energy|premise|Barrages can help protect coastal ecosystems from the devastation of a storm.
12593| Tidal energy|conclusion|Offshore turbines don't hamper the flow of tides.
12593| Tidal energy|premise|Offshore turbines do not alter the flow of tides as much as barrages can, so have a smaller environmental impact.
12594| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy disrupts marine ecosystems like a dam.
12594| Tidal energy|premise|Barrages effectively dam estuaries and bays in order to build-up and concentrate water mass into turbines that convert the energy to electricity.
12595| Tidal energy|conclusion|"Tidal energy can impair the natural ""flushing"" of water ecosystems."
12595| Tidal energy|premise|"Bays and estuaries are always naturally ""flushed"" or cleansed and replenished by tide-waters flowing in and out."
12596| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy can lead to prolonged and undesirable winter icing.
12596| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal energy can slow the movement of water in a bay or estuary, which reduces the amount of kinetic energy and causes the body of water to freeze-over more often or for longer periods of time.
12597| Tidal energy|conclusion|Anchors of tidal energy systems can damage ecosystems.
12597| Tidal energy|premise|"""The devices' anchors and cables might damage critical ecosystems like salt marshes, estuaries, and near-shore reefs, or alter the natural processes that maintain ocean and coastal ecosystems, such as the movement of sand, silt, animals, and larvae."
12598| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy burns no fossil fuels and releases no emissions.
12598| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal power derives its power from the ocean tides and currents.
12599| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal power can generate massive energy and slash emissions.
12599| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal energy can produce massive quantities of energy.
12600| Tidal energy|conclusion|Clean energy contribution from tidal power is good.
12600| Tidal energy|premise|"""Tidal energy use may not be a big player in our energy future, but it can make a contribution."
12601| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy generates very little energy comparatively.
12601| Tidal energy|premise|"""there is only one major tidal generating station in operation."
12602| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal power requires no fuel.
12602| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal energy does not require any fuel.
12603| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy has existed and been developed for ages.
12603| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal energy is one of the oldest forms of energy used by humans.
12604| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy is still new.
12604| Tidal energy|premise|Give tidal energy time to develop, and its costs will drop dramatically.
12605| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal power has a low capacity factor .
12605| Tidal energy|premise|The net capacity factor of a power plant is the ratio of the actual output of a power plant period over its output if it could operate at the full capacity of the installed generator.
12606| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal power generates little return on investment so is unviable.
12606| Tidal energy|premise|Lewis Page of The Register (UK) estimates that the US tidal energy project SeaGen will not recover the costs of its initial investment until the end of its predicted life of 20 years.
12607| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy is new.
12607| Tidal energy|premise|While it is possible that tidal energy will become viable in the future, it is a very young resource compared to other renewables, so cannot be expected to be viable for possibly decades to come.
12608| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy could disrupt local fishing industries.
12608| Tidal energy|premise|"""Some fishing communities worry that their fishing grounds could be disturbed."
12609| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy is predictable and reliable.
12609| Tidal energy|premise|The tides and currents are based on the movement of the moon around the earth, so they are entirely predictable.
12610| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy production varies with tides.
12610| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal energy varies on a daily basis with the movements of the tide.
12611| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy supply is out of sink with peak energy demand.
12611| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal power misses peak demand due to the 12.
12612| Tidal energy|conclusion|Potential energy-production of tidal power is immense.
12612| Tidal energy|premise|"""The potential of ocean energy is immense."
12613| Tidal energy|conclusion|Very few sites globally are appropriate for tidal energy.
12613| Tidal energy|premise|"""Similar to other ocean energies, tidal energy has several prerequisites that make it only available in a small number of regions."
12614| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal power installation is easier than dams and nuclear plants.
12614| Tidal energy|premise|"While it may not be easy or ""cheap"" to install tidal power turbines and barrages it is certainly much easier than installing massive hydroelectric dams and nuclear plants."
12615| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal turbines can be built into existing bridges.

12620| Tidal energy|premise|Repairing tidal energy systems underwater is very challenging and expensive, as is repairing anything underwater.
12621| Tidal energy|conclusion|Retrieving disintegrated tidal energy parts is problematic.
12621| Tidal energy|premise|The disintegration of some tidal energy turbines and barages is unavoidable.
12622| Tidal energy|conclusion|Forms of tidal energy can be adjusted to limit impact.
12622| Tidal energy|premise|There are many different forms of tidal energy.
12623| Tidal energy|conclusion|Most tidal energy sites have no recreational activities.
12623| Tidal energy|premise|One of the primary locations under consideration for tidal energy, for instance, is the NorthWest coast.
12624| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy systems can disrupt recreational activities.
12624| Tidal energy|premise|Boating, fishing, and swimming activities occur on many coastlines and estuaries.
12625| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy turbines are hidden beneath the water.
12625| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal energy turbines are hidden beneath the water, invisible to the human eye.
12626| Tidal energy|conclusion|"The ""cleanness"" of tidal energy is beautiful."
12626| Tidal energy|premise|The beauty of an object is in the eyes of the beholder.
12627| Tidal energy|conclusion|Small number of tidal energy sites limits aesthetic problems.
12627| Tidal energy|premise|"""the fact that tidal energy use will be extremely limited means that any aesthetic concerns will also be limited."
12628| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy barages look about as bad as dams.
12628| Tidal energy|premise|Barages have the look of dams.
12629| Tidal energy|conclusion|Environmental impact of barages is ugly.
12629| Tidal energy|premise|Barages are fairly massive objects, like Dams, that obstruct the natural flow of water and can, subsequently, have harmful environmental impacts.
12630| Tidal energy|conclusion|Offshore turbines spin slowly, don't jeopardize marine life.
12630| Tidal energy|premise|There is a common concern surrounding wind turbines that they kill (too many) birds.
12631| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal turbines can kill marine wildlife.
12631| Tidal energy|premise|The spinning blades of tidal turbines are capable of killing some wildlife, particularly larger fish and marine mammals.
12632| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal barages produce more energy than other forms of tidal.
12632| Tidal energy|premise|Barage tidal energy acts in a similar way as hydro-electric dams, stopping massive quantities of water and using the mass and pressure to spin turbines that generate electricity.
12634| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal barages disrupt marine ecosystems like dams do.
12634| Tidal energy|premise|Changing tidal flows by damming a bay or estuary could result in negative impacts on aquatic and shoreline ecosystems.
12635| Tidal energy|conclusion|"Tidal barage energy can impair the natural ""flushing"" of water ecosystems."
12635| Tidal energy|premise|"Bays and estuaries are always naturally ""flushed"" or cleansed and replenished by tide-waters flowing in and out."
12636| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy could replace unsafe/polluting nuclear energy.
12636| Tidal energy|premise|There are many concerns surrounding nuclear energy, regarding the potential radiation hazards for nuclear-plant workers and locals as well as for the environment when radioactive nuclear waste is buried.
12637| Tidal energy|conclusion|Nuclear energy should be an important part of combating global warming.
12637| Tidal energy|premise|While there may still be some concerns regarding the safety and local environmental impact of nuclear energy, nuclear energy releases 0-emissions and so is an important part of the fight against global warming.
12638| Tidal energy|conclusion|Tidal energy can't produce enough electricity to replace nuclear.
12638| Tidal energy|premise|Tidal energy is incapable of producing electricity on a large, global scale, due to its low capacity factor (0-production when tides aren't moving) and because it is viable in a very limited number of sites.
12648| Torture|conclusion|"Torture is justified in the ""ticking time-bomb"" scenario ."
12648| Torture|premise|"There is substantial support to the notion that, from the decision-makers perspective, torture would be acceptable in the ""ticking time-bomb"" scenario as a means to save thousands if not millions of lives."
12649| Torture|conclusion|The infliction of mere pain on an evil-minded terrorist to save millions of innocent lives is an ethical trade-off.
12649| Torture|premise|A terrorist will experience pain for a short period while being tortured.
12650| Torture|conclusion|Leaders must be afforded the flexibility to judge that torture is the most probable way to save hundreds of thousands of lives.
12650| Torture|premise|"While some argue that the ""ticking time-bomb"" is a fictitious experiment that impossibly requires perfect information, it need not be based on perfect information."
12651| Torture|conclusion|"A one-in-a-million probability of the ""ticking time bomb"" occurring is sufficient to justify allowing torture in this scenario."
12651| Torture|premise|"It is not necessary that there be a high probability that the ""ticking time bomb"" scenario will occur."
12652| Torture|conclusion|"Even if torture should always be illegal, it is still justified in ""the ticking time bomb"" scenario."
12652| Torture|premise|The ethical trade-off between torture and a million lives is clear enough that torture would be justified in the ticking-time-bomb scenario, even if it should remain illegal for posterity and other reasons.
12653| Torture|conclusion|Brutal killing is considered ethical in certain situations when at war.
12653| Torture|premise|Are there situations where the less brutal water-boarding is ethical? -If a soldier is being attacked by the enemy and he has no weapon except a bayonet, he has been trained and is expected to stab and rip the enemy’s body in the most brutal and destructive way possible.
12654| Torture|conclusion|Torture is always wrong.
12654| Torture|premise|The ends do not justify the means in the case of torture.
12655| Torture|conclusion|"The ""ticking time-bomb"" imagines an impossible scenario of perfect information."
12655| Torture|premise|"It is nearly impossible that intelligence would lead to the certainty of the existence of a ""ticking time-bomb"", the exact nature of the bomb, the location, the timing of the detonation, and the lives at stake."
12656| Torture|conclusion|The ticking time-bomb scenario leads to a slippery slope of intrusion on rights.
12656| Torture|premise|The ticking time-bomb scenario is based on probabilities of risk, not certainties, that could lead to a slippery slope of torturing individuals on the mere speculation that it could save lives.
12657| Torture|conclusion|Torture erodes the character of a nation and its success in the war of ideas.
12657| Torture|premise|A civilized nation cannot keep the moral high-ground if it commits acts of torture.

12661| Torture|premise|"stating, ""No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
12662| Torture|conclusion|Torture is banned under The United Nations Convention Against Torture.
12662| Torture|premise|This treaty applies to all individuals, POW or terrorist.
12663| Torture|conclusion|Terrorists are going to kidnap, torture, and kill Western troops regardless of whether the West uses torture.
12663| Torture|premise|Terrorists are brutal enemies that would not be affected by the decision of a Western country to use torture.
12664| Torture|conclusion|Torture is not being applied to legitimate foreign troops, but terrorists.
12664| Torture|premise|No Western nation is performing torture on prisoners of war (POWs) from other sovereign states.
12665| Torture|conclusion|Performing torture puts a country's troops at risk of being tortured in return.
12665| Torture|premise|One of the main reasons for international laws regarding the treatment of prisoners of war is to protect a country's own troops from mistreatment abroad.
12667| Torture|conclusion|Torture is not punishment, but a measure to protect innocent civilians.
12667| Torture|premise|Any proper application of torture would only be toward the extraction of information that could help save lives.
12668| Torture|conclusion|Some terrorists may deserve a little extra punishment for the death and misery they've caused.
12668| Torture|premise|If some terrorist have inflicted a massive amount of pain and suffering, aren't they due a proportional amount of punishment.
12669| Torture|conclusion|Cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited in all civilized countries, undermining a strict reading of due desert.
12669| Torture|premise|While due desert is an important legal concept, there must be boundaries to it.
12670| Torture|conclusion|Torture actually creates sympathy for people who should otherwise be scorned and shamed.
12670| Torture|premise|Pity for terrible criminals and terrorists should not be fostered, as it undermines that appropriate punishment of shame and guilt.
12673| Torture|conclusion|The West's use of torture is trivial compared to many countries.
12673| Torture|premise|The problem with the heavy criticisms of the use of torture in Western countries such as the United States is that it seems to ignore the much more gruesome use of torture in third-world and developing countries.
12674| Torture|conclusion|Countries should act on principle, not the prevailing trends of other countries.
12674| Torture|premise|It doesn't matter what other countries or the world in general are doing.
12679| Torture|conclusion|The US Supreme Court ruled in the 2006 Hamdan case that detainees are protected from torture by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.
12679| Torture|premise|The US Supreme Court ruling in Hamdan in 2006 ruled that all detainees, wherever held, were protected by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which bans all forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as well as torture.

12702| Trade vs aid|conclusion|Trade allows a fair impression of the international order to be created.
12702| Trade vs aid|premise|One of the problems of the current aid system is said to be that it creates an impression amongst receiving countries and their people that the west is a wealthy, free-handed donor which provides what seem like huge sums of money by local standards.
12703| Trade vs aid|conclusion|Trade allows developing countries to retain their dignity.
12703| Trade vs aid|premise|Aid is often seen as quite a patronising concept, no matter how necessary it may be argued to be.
12704| Trade vs aid|conclusion|Trade provides developing countries with an important basis for their own improvement.
12704| Trade vs aid|premise|To gear up to be successful trading partners, developing countries often need to go through a number of key changes.
12705| Trade vs aid|conclusion|Aid allows for money in a given country to be allocated well against need.
12705| Trade vs aid|premise|At the micro- level as well as the macro, trade is an inefficient distributor of resources in a developing country.
12706| Trade vs aid|conclusion|Aid money is often misspent, even when handled honestly.
12706| Trade vs aid|premise|"By imposing solutions from outside, it favors big projects, ""grand gestures"" and centralization - all of which may be inappropriate, only benefit a small number of people, and suffer from intended consequences."
12707| Trade vs aid|conclusion|There is currently no international system for assessing whether or not official development assistance contributions are matching programme country needs.
12707| Trade vs aid|premise|or even for ensuring that the process is objective and transparent.
12708| Trade vs aid|conclusion|Exposing fragile developing economies to free trade is very risky.
12708| Trade vs aid|premise|There is a short term danger that a flood of cheap (because of developed world subsidies) imports will wreck local industries who are unable to compete fairly.
12709| Trade vs aid|conclusion|Trade can distribute its benefits unevenly.
12709| Trade vs aid|premise|Aid is linked to need not the ability to engage in trade.
12710| Trade vs aid|conclusion|The opportunities for trade are severely limited because of barriers imposed by the international system.
12710| Trade vs aid|premise|The arguments made by pro-trade proponents are often couched in the rhetoric of market economics.

12782| Trying terrorist suspects in civilian courts|premise|"""Trying the 9/11 defendants before military commissions, on the other hand, would be widely (if unfairly) denounced as designed to ensure convictions regardless of the evidence."
12783| Trying terrorist suspects in civilian courts|conclusion|Civilian courts are faster than military tribunals.

12825| Turkey EU membership|premise|The new Justice and Development Party (AK) government is not seeking to overturn the secular constitution, although it does want to amend some laws that positively discriminate against devout Muslims.
12826| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Opposing Turkey's admission on the basis of Europe's Christian heritage is wrong.
12826| Turkey EU membership|premise|Europe does have a predominantly Christian heritage, but no modern, religiously tolerant politician should oppose the membership of a country on the basis of religious differences.
12827| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkey's EU admission would provide religious balance in Europe.
12827| Turkey EU membership|premise|Europe is seen as a Christian club in many ways.
12828| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Admitting Turkey to the EU would cause the Islamisation of Europe.
12828| Turkey EU membership|premise|"The (outgoing) European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Frits Bolkestein, warned of the ""Islamisation of Europe"" and said that should Turkey become an EU member ‘The relief of Vienna in 1683 by a Catholic army from an Ottoman siege will have been in vain’."
12829| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|"Most opposition to Turkish membership is unrelated to ""Christian club"" in EU."
12829| Turkey EU membership|premise|"""It has become fashionable to denounce those who oppose Turkish membership as wanting to keep Europe as a ‘Christian club’."
12830| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkey's government and politics has Islamist elements.
12830| Turkey EU membership|premise|Turkey is not a Christian country but a Muslim one, unlike all the current or prospective EU states, which have been shaped by a shared legacy of Christian values, history and culture.

12837| Turkey EU membership|premise|Turkey is a large country in European terms, but even if its population would make it the largest single EU member by 2020, this would still only give it some 15% of the total in an enlarged EU of 25 countries or more.
12838| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkey size would give it too much voting power in the EU.
12838| Turkey EU membership|premise|By 2020, on current population trends, it is likely to have more than 90 million people, making it the largest single state in the EU.
12839| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkey's proximity to conflict zones would not endanger the EU.

12847| Turkey EU membership|premise|Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece were all much poorer than the EU average when they joined and all are now well integrated and much more prosperous.
12848| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|The EU will never be able to integrate Turkey economically.

12851| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkish labor market would benefit EU.
12851| Turkey EU membership|premise|"""The nature of Turkey’s labor market."
12852| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|EU should not admit Turkey to gain young immigrant workers.

12853| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkey was promised a chance to join the EU at the Helsinki summit .
12853| Turkey EU membership|premise|This was when its candidacy was unanimously accepted after three decades of consistent Turkish requests.
12854| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|By breaking its promises, the EU may turn Turkey into an enemy.
12854| Turkey EU membership|premise|If the EU is seen to break its promise to Turkey it may turn a potential friend and partner into a suspicious and hostile neighboor.
12855| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|That Turkey needs to reform should not block its admission to the EU.
12855| Turkey EU membership|premise|Clearly economic and political reforms are necessary, but that is true of all member states and should not be used as an excuse to backtrack now.
12856| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|The EU never promised membership to Turkey.
12856| Turkey EU membership|premise|Turkey first applied to join the EU back in the 1960s but there is no document where EU leaders have promised to include Turkey in the future.
12857| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkey deserves a privileged partnership with the EU.
12857| Turkey EU membership|premise|This position has been maintained by prominent politicians such as former French president Jacques Chirac.
12858| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Genocide allegations irrelevant to Turkey EU membership.
12858| Turkey EU membership|premise|"Javier Solano, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Secretary-General of both the Council of the European Union (EU) and the Western European Union (WEU), when asked a question on whether the allegations of Armenian Genocide were an impediment for Turkey to accede to EU stated on April 3 2009, that ""history was history and should be left to historians to be analyzed."
12859| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Admitting Turkey undermines European values.
12859| Turkey EU membership|premise|It is fundamentally wrong to admit a country that directly violates laws of a significant number of European states (in Germany denying genocide is illegal), the more if it concerns such a sensitive issue.
12860| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|Turkey has acted according to EU wishes in Cyprus.
12860| Turkey EU membership|premise|"""As part of this pressing ahead, Turkey duly ‘fell into line’ on Cyprus, by – successfully - urging Turkish Cypriots to support the April 2004 referendum in northern Cyprus on the Annan Plan for re-unification of the island."
12862| Turkey EU membership|conclusion|EU states strongly opposed to Turkey's admission should not be dragged along.
12862| Turkey EU membership|premise|In a few states there are actually large majorities against: by as much as 2: 1 in Austria, France and Germany.

12865| Turkey EU membership|premise|"""The majority of Turkish people today favour joining the EU despite worsening Franco-Turkish relations and a partial freeze on EU-Turkey accession talks."

12866| TV viewing is harmful to children|premise|The popularity of TV watching is among the reasons of this phenomenon.

12874| Twin Towers reconstruction|premise|Pentagon, hardly a symbol of peace, has been rebuilt.
12875| Twin Towers reconstruction|conclusion|The fact that the Twin Towers weren't rebuilt is a symbol of defeat of the american way of life.
12875| Twin Towers reconstruction|premise|Actually, the currently planned status of the WTC site is one giant advertisement for the success of terrorism.
12876| Twin Towers reconstruction|conclusion|The facade of Twin Towers would be an excellent place for various peaceful artwork.
12876| Twin Towers reconstruction|premise|The whole facade could be partitioned to squares, which could hold either a decent collection of static pictures or - better yet - large digital screens, like those on the Times square.
12878| Twin Towers reconstruction|conclusion|The Bible speaks of rebirth.

12883| Twin Towers reconstruction|premise|The omnipresent presentation of the Twins as symbols of America goes directly against this commandment, as would the reconstruction.
12884| Twin Towers reconstruction|conclusion|The price of reconstruction would be like pool in a sea.
12884| Twin Towers reconstruction|premise|The rebuilding of the WTC would cost only a fraction of the expenditures already spent on the War on terrorism, not to mention the cost of wasteful bailouts.

12889| Twitter|conclusion|Twitter distracts from deeper interactions in the present.
12889| Twitter|premise|No, Twitter makes people think in terms of everyone but who they are with, including themselves.
12890| Two-party system|conclusion|Two-party system emerge as representations of public will.
12890| Two-party system|premise|Where two-party systems have emerged it is either the result, or reflection of the will of the electorate.
12891| Two-party system|conclusion|Two-party systems create false dichotomies.
12891| Two-party system|premise|By framing debate in terms of only two-parties or points of view the two-party system gives the false impression that their are only two choices on any given issue.
12892| Two-party system|conclusion|"""Left""/""right"" ideologies of two-party systems are no longer clear cut."
12892| Two-party system|premise|The cold war with its left/right divisions is over and ideological labels are increasingly meaningless as, for example, traditional parties of the left have embraced the market.
12893| Two-party system|conclusion|Two-party systems establish precedents that exclude third parties.
12893| Two-party system|premise|Third parties often find it difficult to emerge later, even if they have a decent following.

12897| Two-party system|premise|The longer people hold office, the more comfortable they become and the less likely they are to take risks and make controversial decisions.
12898| Two-party system|conclusion|Two-party systems are more stable.
12898| Two-party system|premise|Because parliamentary majorities in multi-party systems can shift suddenly, those systems are far less stable.
12899| Two-party system|conclusion|Multi-party systems do not fairly implement the wishes of the electorate.
12899| Two-party system|premise|This is because the government and policies formed after an election are often the result of backroom deals between parties instead of being based of manifesto promises and the number of votes cast.
12900| Two-party system|conclusion|Threat of losing office in multi-party system encourages compromise.
12900| Two-party system|premise|The threat of a no-confidence vote, a collapsing coalition, or the departure of a coalition partner from a governing majority forces leaders to make compromises and compromises make for policies that serve the interest of the majority of the voters.
12901| Two-party system|conclusion|Diverse opinions are suppressed in a two-party system.

12905| Two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict|premise|"""The conflict between the Palestinians and the Zionist movement is not over disputed borders or material interests and, therefore, resolvable by merely coming to an agreement over permanent borders and a give-and-take over material interests."

13019| United Nations Standing Army|conclusion|A UN standing army would bring benefits to the world economy.
13019| United Nations Standing Army|premise|through avoiding the costs of refugee crises and other humanitarian disasters.
13020| United Nations Standing Army|conclusion|The cost of such an army would be very high.
13020| United Nations Standing Army|premise|especially if it were to include purchase of air and sea transport to reach theatres of operation, added to the high costs of permanent establishment and training, and equipping the force for every possible type of terrain.
13021| United Nations Standing Army|conclusion|Although other reforms of the UN may be desirable in their own right.
13021| United Nations Standing Army|premise|without involving the creation of a standing army they will not address the central problems of peacekeeping.
13022| United Nations Standing Army|conclusion|If it is granted that the UN currently reacts too slowly to crises.
13022| United Nations Standing Army|premise|alternatives for an improved response could be implemented without resorting to a standing army.
13023| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The UN veto is anachronistic.
13023| UN Security Council veto|premise|The world no longer needs the Security Council veto.
13024| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The UN Security Council Veto is unreflective of geopolitical realities.
13024| UN Security Council veto|premise|The global power balance has shifted dramatically since 1945, making the nations' participation in global cooperation for security more crucial.
13025| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The UN Security Council veto perpetuates differences and animosity.
13025| UN Security Council veto|premise|A P-5 country typically vetoes a resolution in the United Nations because they or their allies have a strong national or cultural interest in doing so.
13026| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|UN veto perpetuates unfortunate geopolitical games.
13026| UN Security Council veto|premise|The UN veto system was established, in part, to ensure that the United Nations fits within the broader geopolitical game and that it is tolerated within that game.
13027| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The UN SC veto is justifiably given to nuclear powers.
13027| UN Security Council veto|premise|The P-5 veto holding members of the UN SC are unique in that they are the only countries that have nuclear arsenals (not simply a small stock nuclear weapons).
13028| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|P-5 veto encourages strongest states to work inside not outside the system.
13028| UN Security Council veto|premise|If all states are given equal power in the UN SC, it is possible that the most powerful states in the international system will simply not participate.
13029| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|P-5 veto rewards the disproportionate contribution to global security.
13029| UN Security Council veto|premise|The most important function of the United Nations, as defined in the UN Charter, is the maintenance of international security.
13030| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Abandoning UN SC veto to constrain the US would be wrong.
13030| UN Security Council veto|premise|"""If the Security Council is to enforce its collective decisions, U."
13031| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The UN SC veto violates democratic principal of sovereign equality.
13031| UN Security Council veto|premise|It is no longer viable to argue that nations agreed to join the UN as an unequal body.
13032| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The UN Charter does not offer sovereign equality.
13032| UN Security Council veto|premise|The UN charter does not explicitly offer sovereign equality as a right in the international system.
13033| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Abolishing veto would enable more global action in the UN.
13033| UN Security Council veto|premise|If the veto was abolished, more measures would make it through the general assembly and security council that reflect the will of the general assembly.
13034| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Veto power undermines the moral stature of the UN.
13034| UN Security Council veto|premise|Morality in the international system is defined in large part by equality.
13035| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|"Security Council veto undermines UN's ""soft power"" legitimacy."
13035| UN Security Council veto|premise|"The United Nations exercises ""soft power"" better than ""hard power""."
13036| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|P-5 veto ensures measures aren't passed that UN can't fulfill.
13036| UN Security Council veto|premise|If measures are passed in the UN that even a single of the Great Powers objects to, the chances that the measure will be implemented are very slim, as a Great Power is liable to take unilateral actions to block implementation.
13037| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The veto power has been wielded with increasing success both during and since the Cold War.
13037| UN Security Council veto|premise|This makes it still necessary for increased efficiency in the Security Council.
13038| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Veto power is frequently hijacked by national agendas.
13038| UN Security Council veto|premise|In the rare recent circumstances in which the veto power has been utilised, it has been hijacked by ideological demands and petty national interests.
13039| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The United States unjustly protects Israel with UN veto.
13039| UN Security Council veto|premise|The United States has protected Israel from international condemnation in the UN SC dozens of times.
13040| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|"The ""hidden"" threat of the UN veto is a major concern."
13040| UN Security Council veto|premise|The threat of the use of the veto is as powerful in preventing resolutions being passed as the actual veto itself.
13041| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|"""Uniting for Peace"" Resolutions to bypass UN vetoes are only symbolic."
13041| UN Security Council veto|premise|"The problem with General Assembly ""Uniting for Peace"" resolutions is that they don't circumvent the reality that the security council is still responsible for the implementation of measures."
13042| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|UN veto is being abused to stymie country admissions to UN.
13042| UN Security Council veto|premise|Country admission into the UN and into the Security Council is a sensitive topic for some countries, and can often involve deeply rooted prejudices.
13043| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|P-5 vetoes generally uphold international security interests.
13043| UN Security Council veto|premise|The military might of each of the P5 members individually, and within separate groups, notably the UK and US axis within NATO, is such that the avoidance of disagreement is crucial to international peace.
13044| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|"UN SC vetoes can be bypassed with ""Uniting for Peace"" Resolution."
13044| UN Security Council veto|premise|"""There's an esoteric maneuver to get around a threatened veto: invoking the obscure U."
13045| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Reforming the UN security council is constitutionally feasible.
13045| UN Security Council veto|premise|As Richard Butler has observed, a proper debate about the defects of the veto might at the least yield a “more constructive interpretation” of the nature of the veto and its application.
13046| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|UN veto harms US interests more than it benefits them.
13046| UN Security Council veto|premise|The United States more frequently pushes the Security Council to take action than not.
13047| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|P-5 countries will not allow the abolition of their UN SC vetoes.
13047| UN Security Council veto|premise|The abolition of the power of veto is highly unlikely.
13048| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Abolition is not a solution.
13048| UN Security Council veto|premise|Veto power propels Powerful engines(P-5) in active world politics and prevent collision between them.
13049| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The veto power operates to the detriment of international arms control agreements.
13049| UN Security Council veto|premise|The web of treaties that concern the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are enforced directly or indirectly by the Security Council.
13050| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Non-proliferation failures shouldn't be attributed to UN veto.
13050| UN Security Council veto|premise|Non proliferation is a highly sensitive and precarious issue, riven by cross-currents of history and intelligence.
13051| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Extending UN SC veto to more countries would reduce UN effectiveness.
13051| UN Security Council veto|premise|"While one way to ""level the playing field"" is to offer the veto to more countries that ""deserve"" it according to their geopolitical standing, the problem is that this risks increasing the instances in which the veto is used, and in which resolutions are blocked by the national agendas of countries."
13052| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Extension of UN SC veto power to other countries will be resisted by current veto holders.
13052| UN Security Council veto|premise|Current veto holders enjoy their privileged position and are unlikely to go along with the extension of this privilege to other countries, as it dilutes their own veto power.
13053| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Expanding UN SC veto would increase unilateral military actions.
13053| UN Security Council veto|premise|With the likelihood of more vetoes being leveled in the UN SC, particularly in regard to the use of military force, it is likely that more countries will take unilateral military action in the face of a veto.
13054| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Australia doesn't deserve a UN SC veto.
13054| UN Security Council veto|premise|Australia simply does not have the geopolitical power to warrant this.
13055| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|UN SC veto need not be abolished, but extended to more countries.
13055| UN Security Council veto|premise|The veto simply needs to be extended to more countries and in a manner that is more reflective of the geopolitical distribution of power today, as opposed to post-WWII when the current veto-powers were originally distributed.
13056| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|Germany should receive UN Security Council veto power.
13056| UN Security Council veto|premise|Germany is the strongest power in Europe economically and in terms of its population and territory.
13057| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|UN reform will not solve problem of states acting in self interest.
13057| UN Security Council veto|premise|The UN is generally an ineffectual body in the sense that states are keen on acting in their self-interest, whether or not the Security Council gives any blessings or condemnations.
13058| UN Security Council veto|conclusion|The General Assembly should be able to overrule a UN SC veto.
13058| UN Security Council veto|premise|Instead of abolishing the veto altogether, one solution would be to minimize its power by offering the general assembly the ability to overrule the veto through a supermajority, 2/3 vote.
13086| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US-India nuclear deal forges a strategic partnership.
13086| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|The US-India nuclear deal will help forge a strategic relationship to pursue common interests in fighting terrorism, spreading democracy, and preventing the domination of Asia by any single power.
13087| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Nuclear deal is justified by India and USA being largest democracies.
13087| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|The United States and India hold a unique bond in the simple fact that they are the world's two largest democracies.
13088| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|The US and India have a history of peaceful nuclear relations.
13088| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|In the 1950s, the United States helped India develop nuclear energy under the Atoms for Peace program.
13089| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US nuclear industry would benefit from nuclear deal with India.
13089| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""The United States also stands to benefit from the proposed arrangement."
13090| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US-India nuclear deal was rushed and imposed top-down.
13090| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|The agreement was rushed and takes unnecessary risks without adequate preparation or expert review.
13091| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Nuclear deal with India distracts US diplomatic resources.
13091| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""This misdirection of time and high-level attention will be sustained for months to come, as the Bush administration seeks to convince the Congress and the Nuclear Suppliers Group that closer US ties with India warrant relaxed controls governing nuclear commerce."
13092| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Nuclear deal could backfire if India becomes a foe of the US.
13092| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""We all know that friendly states can also be problem states, as is evident in Pakistan."
13093| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Nuclear deal helps India meet rapidly growing energy demand.
13093| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|B.
13094| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Nuclear energy will cleanly meet India's growing energy demands.
13094| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"Condoleezza Rice - ""India is a country that has tremendously growing demand for energy."
13095| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Deal will help India modernize its nuclear energy plants.
13095| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""The nuclear deal is vitally important to India because it is desperately seeking to modernize its aging nuclear power plants with the hope of addressing its acute energy needs."
13096| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US can supply India with high technology that will help it modernize.
13096| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""The deal may also presage Indian access to various forms of high technology from the United States that are currently unavailable because of nuclear-related restrictions."
13097| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Nuclear power would provide India with relatively little energy.
13097| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""While much has been written about the Indo-US nuclear deal, a central question remains unasked: ""Why is the deal important enough to precipitate a crisis in the government?""."
13098| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|There are more cost-effective alternatives to nuclear power for India.
13098| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""There are far more cost-efficient ways to improve India's energy and technology sectors."
13099| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Nuclear deal places safeguards on India's existing plants.
13099| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""Would encourage India to accept international safeguards on facilities it has not allowed to be inspected before."
13100| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|India's history of non-proliferation and nuclear safeguards is unique.
13100| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""Recognizes India's history of imposing voluntary safeguards on its nuclear program."
13101| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US-India nuclear deal shows India is a responsible nuclear power.
13101| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace—currently serving as an adviser to the State Department on Indian affairs—says in congressional testimony that the deal recognizes this growing relationship by engaging India, which has proven it is not a nuclear proliferation risk.
13102| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US-India nuclear deal rewards India's past safeguards, encourages future ones.
13102| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""Rewards India's decision to adopt similar nuclear export standards as those imposed by the ."
13103| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US-India deal does not restrict the number of nuclear weapons produced.
13103| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""The deal does not require India to restrict the number of nuclear weapons it plans to produce."
13104| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US-India deal does not cap or limit Indian fissile material production.
13104| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""The deal does not require India to cap or limit its fissile material production."
13105| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Safeguards apply only to fissile materials produced after the agreement.
13105| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""The safeguards apply only to facilities and material manufactured by India beginning when the agreement was reached."
13106| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|US-India nuclear safeguards are conditioned only on the continuous supply of fuel.
13106| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""the administration pledged to support what New Delhi calls “India-specific” safeguards, which will be conditioned on the indefinite supply of fuel."
13107| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Sending nuclear fuel to India frees its own uranium for more bombs.
13107| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center - ""We are going to be sending, or allowing others to send, fresh fuel to India—including yellowcake and lightly enriched uraniumt—that will free up Indian domestic sources of fuel to be solely dedicated to making many more bombs than they would otherwise have been able to make."
13108| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|India said its nuclear program was peaceful until first bomb test .
13108| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""New Delhi has done similar things in the past; India claimed it was using nuclear technology for civilian purposes right up until its first nuclear weapons test in 1974."
13109| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|The NPT was already doomed.

13112| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|The US-India nuclear deal helps protect both countries from China.
13112| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|What role does China play in the U.
13113| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|India is less interested in deterring China than cooperating with it economically.
13113| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|Robert Blackwill, a former U.
13114| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|India is not interested in being a US-counterweight against China.
13114| US-Indian nuclear deal|premise|"""A third assumption – that India would naturally serve as a counterweight to China – helps explain why the administration has given New Delhi a free pass on nuclear testing, fissile material production, and stockpile growth."
13115| US-Indian nuclear deal|conclusion|Giving India nuclear aid could spark a harmful rivalry with China.

13120| Using sanctions to end child labor|conclusion|Ending child labor takes precedent over international trade.
13120| Using sanctions to end child labor|premise|It means that the international community can and should place child labor concerns above the interests of free trade.
13121| Using sanctions to end child labor|conclusion|Many children have to work to pay for school.
13121| Using sanctions to end child labor|premise|The idea of labouring children entering school is belied by evidence showing many either cannot afford to pay school fees or continue to work at the same time.
13122| Using sanctions to end child labor|conclusion|Early exposure to work can give experience and perpsective to children.
13122| Using sanctions to end child labor|premise|Assuming that a working environment is not abusive, understanding the role of work early in life can be an important lesson to young people.
13123| Using sanctions to end child labor|conclusion|Sanctions are the most effective way to pressure change on social and economic issues.
13123| Using sanctions to end child labor|premise|Whilst codes of ‘human rights’ are effective bases for enforcing political and legal standards, they are less effective in dealing with social and economic ones.
13124| Using sanctions to end child labor|conclusion|Most sanctions are focused narrowly on the export sector.
13124| Using sanctions to end child labor|premise|According to the U.

13210| US electoral college|premise|The US Senate gives 2 representatives to every state in the senate, regardless of the differing sizes of those states.
13211| US electoral college|conclusion|Protecting vote equality is more important than protecting small state interests.
13211| US electoral college|premise|In a democracy, it is of utmost importance that each citizen has an equal voice and that their vote be counted equally.
13212| US electoral college|conclusion|The electoral college helps protect the interests of smaller states in the union.
13212| US electoral college|premise|The current system provides for the protection of the rights of all 50 states, because it forces candidates to appeal to the voters in all parts of America.
13213| US electoral college|conclusion|"The electoral college's ""winner-takes-all"" system causes campaigning only to swing states."

13214| US electoral college|premise|As America is a large, diverse country, any system which encourages and rewards parties who appeal to a broad geographical range of areas is more likely to lead to a government which is in tune with the needs and values of most of society, as opposed to the UK, where very often the concerns of London and South-east England dominate parliament.
13217| US electoral college|conclusion|The electoral college disenfranchises third parties.
13217| US electoral college|premise|As a candidate only becomes important if he can amass enough votes in a particular state to threaten to win it, attention is only focused on those parties which have a big enough organization to become truly competitive in a given state.

13219| US electoral college|premise|This is good for the country.
13220| US electoral college|conclusion|Demographic shifts are not well accounted for in the electoral college.
13220| US electoral college|premise|With great movements of people from state to state every year, it is difficult to readjust the electoral vote totals to keep up with the changes in population distribution.
13221| US electoral college|conclusion|It is not difficult to adjust electoral votes according to demographic shifts.
13221| US electoral college|premise|Redistributing seats, vote totals, and so on is a problem which occurs in any democracy, and is usually adequately carried out by impartial bodies.
13222| US electoral college|conclusion|Leaders are legitimized by winning a popular majority or plurality, but the electoral college undermines this.
13222| US electoral college|premise|George Bush’s disputed victory in 2000 was unhealthy for democracy and for the authority of the President, since many people said that he had no right to govern, regardless of what the outcome of the electoral college was.
13223| US electoral college|conclusion|Polls show that Americans would prefer a popular vote over an electoral college.
13223| US electoral college|premise|A Washington Post poll found in 2000 after the Bush victory that 6 out of 10 would prefer a popular vote system.
13224| US electoral college|conclusion|Americans support the electoral college system because they see it as a guarantor of their rights.
13224| US electoral college|premise|Most Americans were prepared to accept George Bush as President following the Supreme Court’s decision on the Florida recount issue.
13225| US electoral college|conclusion|Minority interests must be protected against majority support for popular vote.
13225| US electoral college|premise|The electoral college is specifically designed to protect minority interests in the United States.
13226| US electoral college|conclusion|The electoral college creates a crisis of legitimacy.
13226| US electoral college|premise|The electoral college inherently creates a crisis of legitimacy in instances in which an elected president does not win the popular vote.
13227| US electoral college|conclusion|A nation-wide popular vote risks recounts and crises of legitimacy.
13227| US electoral college|premise|If the popular vote is used, it is possible that a close election would fall prey to accusations of voter-fraud and calls for a recount.

13240| US health care reform|premise|For those that do not receive insurance from their employers, the 2009 health bill provides aid, to make it easier for them to buy insurance for themselves.

13242| US health care reform|premise|"""To be sure, they would provide insurance to 30 million or more Americans by 2019."
13243| US health care reform|conclusion|Government-approved insurers of US health care law limits competition.
13243| US health care reform|premise|"""ObamaCare would require Americans to buy government-approved health insurance."

13281| US offshore oil drilling|premise|"""Environmentalists argue that the pollution caused by drilling could compromise fragile ecosystems for very little economic benefit when the United States should be focusing on conservation - the cheapest barrel of oil, they like to say, is the one we don't have to buy - and developing better renewable energy sources."
13282| US offshore oil drilling|conclusion|Offshore drilling ban is not responsible for rising gas prices.
13282| US offshore oil drilling|premise|"""It’s beyond disingenuous to imply, as the president did, that the prohibition on offshore drilling is responsible for the present run-up in gas prices or that allowing offshore drilling would do anything to bring prices down."
13283| US offshore oil drilling|conclusion|General statements against offshore oil drilling.

13284| US offshore oil drilling|premise|While it may be true that - in a perfect world - it would be better for offshore oil to be available now, it is not true that it would be of no value down the line five, ten, or twenty years from now.
13285| US offshore oil drilling|conclusion|New offshore oil will take years to come on-line.
13285| US offshore oil drilling|premise|"""increased American production from offshore drilling would not necessarily mean lower prices for American consumers because oil is a global commodity whose price is set by global supply and demand."
13286| US offshore oil drilling|conclusion|Offshore drilling has a very strong environmental record.
13286| US offshore oil drilling|premise|"""Some of the most ironic objections come from those who say offshore exploration will destroy beaches and coastlines, citing the devastating 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska as an example."

13291| US offshore oil drilling|conclusion|Banning offshore drilling forces dangerous tanker transport.
13291| US offshore oil drilling|premise|"""it's even possible that the drilling ban increases the danger of oil spills in coastal waters: Less local drilling means more incoming traffic from oil tankers, which by some reckonings are riskier."

13313| US offshore oil drilling|premise|"""It's completely ridiculous that we are forgoing any sources of oil with gas prices as high as they are, especially when these sources would simultaneously decrease our own dependence on foreign oil."
13314| US offshore oil drilling|conclusion|Wrong to out-source offshore drilling to foreign coasts.
13314| US offshore oil drilling|premise|"Peter Maass, a fellow at the Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, on New York Times Room for Debate, March 31st, 2010: ""As a matter of global justice, why should America exclude its coastlines while coastlines all over the world are drilled for oil that goes into American gas tanks? Banning oil companies from operating in our waters while encouraging them to do so in other people’s waters — there’s a whiff of hypocrisy to that, a sort of outsourcing of oil pollution."

13333| Veal|conclusion|Veal is to cattle as lamb is to sheep.
13333| Veal|premise|"Predicting a rise in consumer interest, a Tesco spokesman said: ""Veal is to cattle what lamb is to sheep and recent TV shows such as The F Word have done a lot to explain that it is OK to eat veal if its production meets strict welfare standards."
13334| Veal|conclusion|Veal farming is a good alternative to the slaughtering of unwanted calves.
13334| Veal|premise|The dairy industry as well as the meat industry often slaughter baby calves for a variety of reasons, either because more calves are born than are needed to supply either dairy production or cow meet, or because the calves that are born will be of an undesirable quality when they grow up, either as a source of dairy products or of meat.
13335| Veal|conclusion|It is cruel to harm and kill baby cows at such an early age.
13335| Veal|premise|Human dignity demands that a special respect be given to the lives of baby animals.
13336| Veal|conclusion|Humans use products from calves, but calves do not use human products.
13336| Veal|premise|Nearly all calves that have ever existed have been used for human use.
13337| Veal|conclusion|If someone killed a human at any age it would be murder, so why should it be any different with cows.
13337| Veal|premise|Cows are intelligent creatures and there is no way they should be murdered for human consumption.
13338| Veal|conclusion|Modern veal producers follow strict regulations on humane treatment.
13338| Veal|premise|Modern veal producers use advanced husbandry practices, as outlined in the Recommended Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Veal Calves, which regulates such things as stall sizes and structures.
13339| Veal|conclusion|If humane practices are not being followed, than regulations can be improved.
13339| Veal|premise|That the treatment of baby cows is cruel in some farms does not mean that such treatment will persist.
13340| Veal|conclusion|Veal calves are kept in tortuous conditions.
13340| Veal|premise|"""The real issue is the calves' experience."
13341| Veal|conclusion|Veal farming is inherently abusive to calves to meet market demands.
13341| Veal|premise|After baby cows are taken away from their mothers and sold at auctions, they are taken to a tiny wooden crates that they will live in for the rest of their short lives.
13342| Veal|conclusion|A ban on veal farming would provide an important boost to animal rights.
13342| Veal|premise|The inherently cruel treatment of baby cows for veal meat must stop, and a ban would really boost animal's rights and welfare.
13343| Veal|conclusion|Anything which involves murdering animals is cruel .
13343| Veal|premise|Murder is cruel, always.
13344| Veal|conclusion|Hutches are an important part of classic veal production.
13344| Veal|premise|Hutches keep veal weak and their muscles atrophied so that they are tender to eat.
13345| Veal|conclusion|Hutches can be more comfortable for veal calves.
13345| Veal|premise|There is no inherently bad quality about hutches.
13346| Veal|conclusion|Hutches could be abandoned without banning veal production completely.
13346| Veal|premise|The American Veal Association, for instance, passed a resolution in 2008 that calls for the veal industry to phase out the use of individual stalls.
13347| Veal|conclusion|Calves are kept in inhuman conditions in hutches.
13347| Veal|premise|"""Solitary Confinement The veal crate is a wooden restraining device that is the veal calf's permanent home."
13348| Veal|conclusion|"""Loose housing"" allows calves to roam free."
13348| Veal|premise|"""Loose housing"" allows calves to roam free when grazing and at other times."
13349| Veal|conclusion|Loose housing for calves often subjects them to bullying and apprehension.
13349| Veal|premise|By allowing male calves to roam and graze with one-another, bullying often occurs with the result of apprehensions and fear among calves.
13350| Veal|conclusion|Milk-based diets are healthy and humane for veal.
13350| Veal|premise|"""Milk-based diets are balanced rations that involve commercial milk replacers, which utilize surplus skim milk powder and whey – both byproducts of the dairy industry – in their production."
13351| Veal|conclusion|Calves are fed inhumane milk diets to keep them anemic and their meat pale.
13351| Veal|premise|The iron-deficiency of this diet is what causes the anemia of calves that keeps their meat desirably pale.
13352| Veal|conclusion|Grain-only diets are adequate for calf veal farming.
13352| Veal|premise|"""Grain-based diets are usually a balanced corn-based feed that contains supplemental protein, vitamins and minerals, and it becomes the calves’ exclusive diet after weaning."
13353| Veal|conclusion|Grain diets are rare in veal because it produces tougher meat.
13353| Veal|premise|Milk is much more frequently used in veal production because it produces the desirable effects of anemia, which results in more tender and paler meat, which is what the market appears to desire.
13354| Veal|conclusion|Veal farming is an economically important industry that cannot be scrapped.
13354| Veal|premise|If we were to ban veal farming, many people would lose their jobs and the whole veal industry would be destroyed.
13356| Veal|conclusion|The inefficient land-use of veal is not a justification to ban veal.
13356| Veal|premise|While cattle farming may be inefficient, this is not a sufficient justification for banning the practice, unless land-use is seen as a major, pressing societal problem.
13357| Veal|conclusion|If cattle land-use is a problem, the markets are best for solving the problem.
13357| Veal|premise|The government should not intervene where the markets are more capable of doing so.
13358| Veal|conclusion|If veal is forbidden in one country it's often simply exported abroad.
13358| Veal|premise|unwanted calves being slaughtered at birth or exported to veal farms in mainland Europe.
13359| Veal|conclusion|Veal farming is wasteful of the growth potential of a baby cow.
13359| Veal|premise|Killing baby cows can be seen as a wasteful and inefficient practice.
13360| Veal|conclusion|Veal and cattle production is a generally inefficient use of land.
13360| Veal|premise|"""In addition to the unnecessary cruelty that millions of cows, calves and cattle must face, there are other factors involved in meat/dairy production to consider."
13361| Veal|conclusion|Veal is low in fat.
13361| Veal|premise|"""Veal is also seen as attractive to health-conscious shoppers, because it is low in fat - a benefit highlighted by the Channel 4 programme Cook Yourself Thin last week, when it substituted veal for half the beef in spaghetti bolognese."
13362| Veal|conclusion|Veal is easy and fast to cook.
13362| Veal|premise|"""Another selling point is that it's fast to cook, said Gill Smith of Waitrose, the only supermarket that continued to sell British veal for 20 years: 'A thin-cut fillet can go from pan to plate in minutes, so it appeals to a new generation of foodies who are time-poor."
13363| Veal|conclusion|Veal tastes very nice.
13363| Veal|premise|Veal is liked by many people and tastes very nice and tender.
13364| Veal|conclusion|Veal calves require antibiotics and medicine that are passed onto consumers.
13364| Veal|premise|"""Because of such extremely unhealthy living conditions and restricted diets, calves are susceptible to a long list of diseases, including chronic pneumonia and 'scours,' or constant diarrhea."
13365| Veal|conclusion|Veal has been part of many countries cultures for hundreds of years.
13365| Veal|premise|Since many hundreds of years ago, humas have realised about how to make veal and that it tastes nice.
13366| Veal|conclusion|Modern cultures are shifting against veal.
13366| Veal|premise|Many people who are concerned about animal rights refuse to buy veal.
13384| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Dominion and meat-eating can and should be excercised responsibly.
13384| Vegetarianism|premise|The notion of man's dominion over animals need not be thought of as a blank check for man to exploit animals.
13385| Vegetarianism|conclusion|"Humans have ""dominion"" over evolutionarily ""domesticated"" animals."
13385| Vegetarianism|premise|"There are certain animals that have evolved with humans, through mutual self-interests in survival, to become ""domesticated"" by humans."
13389| Vegetarianism|conclusion|There is no evidence that vegetarians are more compassionate.
13389| Vegetarianism|premise|"""A Case Against Vegetarianism""."
13390| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Cruelty to animals is wrong, but farming/meat-eating is not always cruel/wrong.
13390| Vegetarianism|premise|Animals are given food, shelter and care if they become ill or injured.
13393| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Animals have rights and it is wrong to kill them needlessly.
13393| Vegetarianism|premise|Humans are animals too and it is not possible morally to set us apart from other species.
13394| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Eating meat means that animals suffer.
13394| Vegetarianism|premise|Farming involves animals like cows, sheep, pigs and chickens being kept in nasty conditions and usually cruelly killed.
13402| Vegetarianism|conclusion|The markets incentivize lowering animal rights and welfare.
13402| Vegetarianism|premise|Supermarkets put huge pressure on farmers to produce meat, milk and eggs at rock bottom prices, so it is not surprising that animal welfare is neglected in a search for profit.
13421| Vegetarianism|conclusion|A vegetarian diet is healthier for humans.
13421| Vegetarianism|premise|Meat (and dairy) eaters eat unhealthily as they take in far too much fat, protein and cholesterol, and often far too little fibre and vitamins.
13422| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Vegetarianism reduces exposure to dioxins found in meats/dairy.
13422| Vegetarianism|premise|Dioxins are poisons found in the environment largely as a bi-product of forms of industrial production.
13423| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Meat-eating is linked to a range of serious illness such as food-poisoning.
13423| Vegetarianism|premise|Almost all dangerous types of food-poisoning (e.
13424| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Eating meat is bad for both animals and for humans.
13424| Vegetarianism|premise|If eating meat is both bad for animals and for humans, it seems that the moral trade-off is fairly simply in favor of vegetarianism.
13425| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Vegetarians avoid consuming chemicals related to animal pain/death.
13425| Vegetarianism|premise|Animal death involves a high degree of animal pain, which causes the release of many chemicals into the bloodstream of animals.
13426| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Vegetarian diet can provide all essential nutrients.
13426| Vegetarianism|premise|"""Plant foods can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults, thus complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal."
13427| Vegetarianism|conclusion|A strictly vegetarian diet can promote health problems.
13427| Vegetarianism|premise|Humans with vegetarian diets are more likely to suffer from fatigue, apathetic behavior, and a lack of concentration.
13428| Vegetarianism|conclusion|It is healthiest to eat a balanced diet with both meat and vegetable products.
13428| Vegetarianism|premise|We should eat five or six portions of fruit and vegetables a day, but without adding some meat or fish it is hard to make sure our body is getting the protein and iron it needs to be healthy.
13429| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Dioxins found in meats are not really dangerous.
13429| Vegetarianism|premise|"""The assertion that dioxins accumulate specifically in animal products is simplistic and inaccurate, and in fact a diet rich in pastured animal products provides protective nutrients, especially vitamin A, that directly oppose the toxic actions of dioxins in animal experiments, while a diet rich in most plant fats provides compounds that enhance the actions of dioxin."
13430| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Vegetarian foods have as many health risks as animal foods.
13430| Vegetarianism|premise|Food safety and hygiene are very important for everyone, and governments should act to ensure that high standards are in place.
13431| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Fats contained in animal meat are healthy to consume in moderation.
13431| Vegetarianism|premise|It is a myth that fats contained in meat are unhealthy; they are healthy in moderation and unhealthy in excess.
13432| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Vegetarians are healthy due to their health-consciousness not vegetarianism.
13432| Vegetarianism|premise|Vegetarians are generally more health-conscious.
13433| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Vegetarianism is important in the fight against global warming.
13433| Vegetarianism|premise|Meat production is highly inefficient in land-use.
13434| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Vegetarianism generally helps the environment.
13434| Vegetarianism|premise|Farming animals is hugely wasteful in land – plant crops require a small part of the space to produce the same amount of calories as livestock.
13435| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Many special environments have been created by livestock farming.
13435| Vegetarianism|premise|for example chalk downland in England and mountain pastures in many countries.
13436| Vegetarianism|conclusion|You don’t have to be vegetarian to be an avid environmentalist.
13436| Vegetarianism|premise|Good examples of environmentalist meat-eaters include Theodore Roosevelt and Native American Indians.
13437| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Due to its relative inefficiency, meat is very expensive.
13437| Vegetarianism|premise|The inefficiency (high land-use and energy-use) of meat production makes it more expensive to produce and thus more pricey (per calorie) on store shelves.
13438| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Meat can be produced very cheaply.
13438| Vegetarianism|premise|Many types of meat are in vary high supply and as a result are available at low costs.
13441| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Evolutionary attachment to animals means they deserve rights.
13441| Vegetarianism|premise|Ever since the publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species in 1859 we have known that human beings are related by common descent to all other animals.
13442| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Offering rights to animals based on evolution is a slippery slope.
13442| Vegetarianism|premise|The fact that we are (incredibly distantly) related to other animals does not mean that it makes sense to talk about them having ‘rights’.
13443| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Non-meat agriculture has a higher yield and can help end famine.
13443| Vegetarianism|premise|The inefficiency of meat production should be seen in the context of global famine.
13444| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Famine is not caused by a lack of food globally.
13444| Vegetarianism|premise|There is enough food in the world.
13445| Vegetarianism|conclusion|Animals belong in their natural habitat in the wild.
13445| Vegetarianism|premise|It is a breach of their natural rights to take them by force into captivity for our own purposes.
13447| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards reduce emissions, fight global warming.
13447| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|The most basic function of fuel economy standards is that they help the average car burn less gasoline, so emit less C02 into the atmosphere.
13448| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Higher fuel economy standards do not increase driving.
13448| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""Some have argued that to raise CAFE standards means that people will only drive more."

13452| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""Increasing CAFE standards will not decrease the amount of pollution coming from the U."
13453| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards reduce emissions, improve air quality.
13453| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|By reducing emissions, it is important to consider how fuel economy standards will improve air quality and public health, particularly in metropolitan areas.
13454| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards only shift environmental impacts.
13454| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"A 1992 National Research Council (NRC) report concluded, ""Improvements in vehicle fuel economy will have indirect environmental impacts."

13457| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards reduce money spent by drivers on gas.
13457| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|Fuel economy standards help reduce the amount of gasoline consumers use in traveling where they want to go.
13458| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Gas savings make-up for any higher initial costs of vehicles.
13458| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""For instance, the savings from buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle can offset the added cost of technology in less than a year by using technologies that are already available and manufacturing vehicles that achieve the CAFE standards and even go beyond them."
13459| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards help car companies stay competitive.
13459| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""Michigan lawmakers year after year shielding Detroit from pressure to innovate on higher mileage standards, even though Detroit’s failure to sell more energy-efficient vehicles has clearly contributed to its brush with bankruptcy, its loss of market share to Toyota and Honda — whose fleets beat all U."

13470| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards don't help energy independence.
13470| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|Fuel economy standards do not decrease fuel consumption because people simply drive more when their cars are more efficient and driving is less expensive.
13471| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards do not put drivers at greater risk.
13471| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""Republican lobbyist Grover Norquist claimed that requiring the automakers to eke up their mpg ratings was tantamount to murdering consumers—by forcing them into smaller cars, putting them at greater risk during collisions."
13472| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Vehicle fuel economy standards can increase vehicle deaths.
13472| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""The evidence is overwhelming that CAFE standards result in more highway deaths."
13473| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Fuel economy standards better politically than gas taxes.
13473| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""Gas taxes, unlike CAFE increases, are basically impossible to pass."
13474| Vehicle fuel economy standards|conclusion|Gas taxes reduce miles driven better than fuel economy standards.
13474| Vehicle fuel economy standards|premise|"""Another policy option is to raise fuel taxes, which unlike CAFE, would reduce congestion and other highway externalities, through reducing vehicle miles traveled."

13518| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|FISA authorized the president to conduct wartime electronic surveillance without warrants.
13518| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|"that, ""The President’s exercise of his constitutional authority to conduct warrantless wartime electronic surveillance of the enemy, as confirmed and supplemented by statute in the AUMF (Authorization for Use of Military Force), is fully consistent with the requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”)."

13519| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|"""Myth: The NSA program violates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)."
13520| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|PATRIOT Act Amendments to FISA lowered boundaries to warrantless wiretapping.
13520| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|"that PATRIOT act amendments to FISA set new standard that required that foreign intelligence gathering be ""a significant purpose"" of the surveillance, as opposed to ""the purpose."

13525| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|The use of 'all necessary and appropriate force in the AUMF validates the warrantless wiretapping program.
13525| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|While the AUMF didn't specifically authorize wiretapping, the authorization of the use of 'all necessary and appropriate force' could be reasonably interpreted is implicitly calling for all measures designed to prevent another terrorist attack against the United States (drawing the connection to the 2004 Hamdi ruling.

13527| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|"""Acknowledges that surveillance is an important facet of warfare."
13528| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|The 2004 Hamdi ruling does not support the case that the AUMF gave the President the right to engage in the NSA wiretapping program.

13529| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|FISA has a clear War Time role and thus can't be overridden by the AUMF.
13529| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|"""In 1975, then-Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong defender of executive authority, testified that in times of conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence surveillance court should be empowered to issue special warrants in these circumstances."

13533| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|The Supreme Court has long held that the Fourth Amendment allows warrantless searches where 'special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement' exist.
13533| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|Foreign intelligence collection, especially in a time of war when catastrophic attacks have already been launched inside the United States, falls within the special needs context.
13534| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|The program easily meets the Court’s reasonableness test for whether a warrant is required.
13534| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|The NSA activities described by the President are narrow in scope and aim, and the government has an overwhelming interest in detecting and preventing further catastrophic attacks on American soil.
13535| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|"Judge Taylor misused the precedent of the ""Youngstown Sheet and Tube Case""  and overlooked many of its and subsequent rulings."

13537| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|"The Bush Administration made the legal claim to ""special needs"" to justify the NSA program: ** - The author maintained that the Bush administration argues that the NSA program may be fitted within a line of Fourth Amendment cases excepting from the warrant and probable cause requirements situations where the government has “special needs” that are above and beyond ordinary law enforcement."
13538| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|"The NSA program is consistent with the President's ""inherent powers""."
13538| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|"""The NSA activities come from the very center of the Commander-in-Chief power, and it would raise serious constitutional issues if FISA were read to allow Congress to interfere with the President’s well-recognized, inherent constitutional authority."
13539| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|The President's Article II powers provide an exception to the warrant requirement that is unassailable by Congress.

13548| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|After 9/11, the NSA began flooding the FBI with thousands telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and names in search of terrorists.
13549| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|conclusion|Other means have uncovered the same evidence revealed by the NSA program.
13549| Warrantless wiretapping in the United States|premise|in both cases cited by the Bush administration, the FBI had initially determined the plots through prisoner interrogations and other means not under the NSA program.

13562| War on Drugs|premise|Drugs will always exist in society, with people trying them for recreational and other purposes, and with the government having little ability to control these private affairs.
13563| War on Drugs|conclusion|War on Drugs increases price of drugs.
13563| War on Drugs|premise|This is seen as a sign of success because it suggests that the supply of drugs has diminished as a result of such things as coca field eradication in Columbia.
13564| War on Drugs|conclusion|War on Drugs helps hold down usage.
13564| War on Drugs|premise|"Per Ann Coulter in her book, ""How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)"": ""Prohibition resulted in startling reductions in alcohol consumption (over 50 percent), cirrhosis of the liver (63 percent), admissions to mental health clinics for alcohol psychosis (60 percent), and arrests for drunk and disorderly conduct (50 percent)."

13570| War on Drugs|conclusion|Costs of Drug War are greater than costs of legalization.
13570| War on Drugs|premise|"""the data here cited instruct us that the cost of the drug war is many times more painful, in all its manifestations, than would be the licensing of drugs combined with intensive education of non-users and intensive education designed to warn those who experiment with drugs."

13574| War on Drugs|premise|There is an argument that much crime and terrorism is drug related or drug funded and that prohibition can reduce this.
13575| War on Drugs|conclusion|War on Drugs helps combat drug-related crimes.
13575| War on Drugs|premise|"The US Drug Enforcement Administration claims: ""Crime, violence and drug use go hand in hand."
13576| War on Drugs|conclusion|Higher price of illegal drugs causes more crimes by users.
13576| War on Drugs|premise|"""This is perhaps the moment to note that the pharmaceutical cost of cocaine and heroin is approximately 2 per cent of the street price of those drugs."
13577| War on Drugs|conclusion|War on Drugs keeps drug trade profitable.
13577| War on Drugs|premise|Experts like Andreas von Bülow and Milton Friedman concede that almost every serious crime of terrorism is funded by illegal drugs but they don't agree that prohibition can reduce these phenomena.

13679| Waterboarding|premise|Waterboarding creates the special effect and feeling of drowning, and the inescapable fear of death.
13680| Waterboarding|conclusion|Suspected information-holders cannot be punished for crimes they do not commit.
13680| Waterboarding|premise|While it is often claimed that a suspected terrorist is set to kill others, and thus his torture is justified, this does not necessarily make sense.
13686| Water privatization|conclusion|Water is a human right, not a commodity.
13686| Water privatization|premise|This argument centers on the notion that the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights, and that water is fundamental to health and life, making it necessary to preserve water as a right in order to protect the right to life.
13687| Water privatization|conclusion|Profit companies are inherently incapable of securing the right to water.
13687| Water privatization|premise|Some argue that even if water is considered a right, companies can reliably (possibly even more reliably than governments) provide it to those in need.
13688| Water privatization|conclusion|Private ownership of water can threaten public health and citizen rights.
13688| Water privatization|premise|While many argue that water is most efficiently supplied by private companies, this is not necessarily the case, and there are numerous instances in which privatization lead to serious disasters and public chaos.
13689| Water privatization|conclusion|Water is not a public right.
13689| Water privatization|premise|What qualifies water as a right? Do people have a right to food or other necessities to sustaining life? No.
13690| Water privatization|conclusion|Water can be treated as an economic good.
13690| Water privatization|premise|"""The idea of 'water as an economic good' is simple."
13691| Water privatization|conclusion|Even if water is considered a right, privatization is the best way to protect that right.
13691| Water privatization|premise|What is the best way to provide quality water, reliably and efficiently to all that need it? The answer includes private companies, which are generally capable of harnessing market forces more efficiently so that they can reliable provide quality water to those that need it.
13692| Water privatization|conclusion|For-profit water companies seek to maximize profits at higher cost to consumers.
13692| Water privatization|premise|Water privatization often leads to price-hikes two or three times higher than the price under public water-utility ownership.
13693| Water privatization|conclusion|Water privatization is at odds with the need to conserve water resources.
13693| Water privatization|premise|For-profit water companies sell water at a price per gallon.
13694| Water privatization|conclusion|Water supply is infrastructure-intensive, making government involvement in it important.
13694| Water privatization|premise|Water is unlike other goods in its weight by volume and the amount of it that is consumed.
13695| Water privatization|conclusion|There is no real competition between water suppliers that gain secure contracts in geographic areas.
13695| Water privatization|premise|"This means that there are no real ""choices"" for consumers to switch to alternative suppliers."
13696| Water privatization|conclusion|Demand for water increases with population growth, so it does not respond to market signals in the way other resources do.
13696| Water privatization|premise|Rich consumers in the developed world also waste water through extravagant use of luxuries such as garden sprinklers, swimming pools, lush golf courses, etc.
13697| Water privatization|conclusion|Water privatization is more economically efficient.
13697| Water privatization|premise|For profit companies are managed by individuals with a direct for-profit stake in the efficiency and productivity of their company.
13698| Water privatization|conclusion|Rapid growth of water infrastructure can only be achieved through private investments.
13698| Water privatization|premise|Water infrastructure is very complicated and expensive to build and maintain.
13699| Water privatization|conclusion|Market investments can spur innovation in the water industry.
13699| Water privatization|premise|Innovation demands risk-taking, which demands, typically, the incentive of returns on investment.
13700| Water privatization|conclusion|Market competition lowers prices for consumers in the water market.
13700| Water privatization|premise|The markets are a competitive arena in which there are incentives between suppliers to cut costs to make their services more competitive.
13701| Water privatization|conclusion|Politics often prevent elected officials from adjusting prices and investing appropriately in water utilities.
13701| Water privatization|premise|It is often unpolitical for elected officials to make tough, bold, sacrificial, or risky moves in regard to water.
13702| Water privatization|conclusion|When water is not treated as an economic good it is wasted.
13702| Water privatization|premise|On a domestic level, unmetered access to water means that consumers do not pay according to the quantity they use and so they will use it wastefully.
13703| Water privatization|conclusion|The problem with private investments in water supply is that large returns are demanded.
13703| Water privatization|premise|Large sums are needed to meet global water targets, but the private sector will only provide these in return for a large commercial return, meaning that the true cost of the investment will eventually be much higher than if it were publicly funded.
13704| Water privatization|conclusion|Problems of water supply need to be addressed with huge investment, particularly in the developing world where many people have no access to decent fresh water.
13704| Water privatization|premise|Even in the developed world, much water (up to 50% in Canada) is wasted through leaks in pipes and ageing infrastructure.
13705| Water privatization|conclusion|Private companies are unlikely to care for the environment.
13705| Water privatization|premise|Their duties are to their shareholders, not to society at large and nature in general.
13706| Water privatization|conclusion|Failing to price water economically is bad for the environment.
13706| Water privatization|premise|Proper pricing of water would reflect all the costs of providing it, including the environmental ones.
13707| Water privatization|conclusion|The public interest in water nationalization should not be constrained by international trade agreements that are corrupted by corporate interests.
13707| Water privatization|premise|International trade agreements were dramatically influenced by and are in large part controlled by multinational corporations.
13708| Water privatization|conclusion|Treating water as a purely economic good will be bad for the poor.
13708| Water privatization|premise|The rich may take advantage of badly targeted subsidies in some developing countries, but that does not mean that these subsidies are not essential to the poor.
13709| Water privatization|conclusion|"Movie ""Flow"" demonstrates how water privatization is bad for poor."
13709| Water privatization|premise|This movie shows how privatization attempts have not been successful in supplying water for the poor but instead have made water even more dirty, less accessible, and taxing on the ways of life for the poor.
13710| Water privatization|conclusion|Treating water as an economic good will make water cheaper.
13710| Water privatization|premise|Current regimes in developing countries often provide a state subsidy to the rich, with water provided to middle-class areas and wealthy farmers at a fraction of its true cost, while poorer areas have no supply at all.
13711| Water privatization|conclusion|Public involvement in water will help provide stable employment.
13711| Water privatization|premise|This is a broad advantage of government involvement in industry.

13805| Wind energy|premise|Wind is naturally occurring and cannot be exhausted.
13806| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy is abundant and can supply massive quantities of energy.
13806| Wind energy|premise|There is more wind energy in the world than man could ever need to fulfill its energy requirements.
13807| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy is free.
13807| Wind energy|premise|Wind energy is entirely free.
13808| Wind energy|conclusion|"Wind ""fuel"" does not require transporting to the generator."
13808| Wind energy|premise|"Unlike many other forms of fuel for electricity generation, wind ""fuel"" does not need to be transported to the windmill generator."
13809| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy is new and is advancing rapidly in its competitiveness.
13809| Wind energy|premise|Wind energy is, compared to other sources of energy, very young.
13810| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy does not require water.
13810| Wind energy|premise|Unlike many other forms of energy generation, wind generators do not require the cycling of water for cooling or as the medium for transferring heat energy into usable electric energy (such as with coal or gas).
13811| Wind energy|conclusion|The installation of windmills can be relatively expensive.
13811| Wind energy|premise|Installation cost.
13813| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy production is often too far from demand.
13813| Wind energy|premise|"""to capture the best breezes, wind farms are often built far from where the demand for electricity is highest."
13814| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind turbines are generally vulnerable to environmental wear and tear.
13814| Wind energy|premise|Wind turbines are fully exposed to wind, rain, snow, and variable temperatures, all of which wear on the windmills.
13815| Wind energy|conclusion|Ramping wind energy up and down produces mechanical stresses.
13815| Wind energy|premise|Because wind blows inconsistently, wind turbines and generators are constantly ramped up and down.
13816| Wind energy|conclusion|Litigation to clear land  for windmills can be costly.
13816| Wind energy|premise|Placing windmills on a ridge is often a subject of controversy in communities.
13817| Wind energy|conclusion|All energy sources need back-ups.
13817| Wind energy|premise|4 Wind energy is unpredictable and must be “backed up” by conventional generation.
13818| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy surges can strain electricity grids.
13818| Wind energy|premise|In Denmark, which pioneered wind energy in Europe, construction of wind farms has stagnated in recent years.
13819| Wind energy|conclusion|Electric grids are not designed for many disparate wind farms.
13819| Wind energy|premise|Electricity grids are typically designed to have a hand full of very large generators contributing massive quantities of energy to the grid from very few locations.
13820| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy relies on subsidies, but just like other energy sources.
13820| Wind energy|premise|"""Wind energy requires a production tax credit (PTC) to achieve these economics."
13821| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy survives because it is heavily subsidized.
13821| Wind energy|premise|"""Creating a welfare-dependent industry in the province may benefit the backers of these projects, but the potential cost to taxpayers is huge, and the outlook for an unsubsidized industry is grim."
13822| Wind energy|conclusion|Only 1 percent of a wind-farm's surface actually gets built on.
13822| Wind energy|premise|As a result, natural wilderness or crop and livestock farming can continue around the bases of the turbines.
13823| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind farms span across wide swaths of territory.
13823| Wind energy|premise|Wind energy is diffuse, so requires collection over wide swaths of territory.
13824| Wind energy|conclusion|Heavy land-use of wind farms can jeopardize forests/ecosystems.
13824| Wind energy|premise|By increasing the demand for land, wind energy creates an incentive to clear forests and other natural areas to make way for wind turbines.
13825| Wind energy|conclusion|Modern wind turbines produces relatively little noise.
13825| Wind energy|premise|For example, in December 2006, a Texas jury denied a noise pollution suit against FPL Energy, after the company demonstrated that noise readings were not excessive.
13826| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind turbines are noisy.
13826| Wind energy|premise|Wind turbines make a kind of thumping noise, much like a slow moving helicopter.
13828| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind turbines cause annoying shadow/light flicker.
13828| Wind energy|premise|"""The industry recognizes that the flicker of reflected light on one side and shadow on the other drives people and animals crazy."
13829| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind turbines can disrupt the scenery of a community.
13829| Wind energy|premise|"Chatham, Ontario businessman Harry Verhey told Chatham Sunrise Rotary Club members, ""The recent proliferation of industrial wind projects will have a negative impact on the community."
13830| Wind energy|conclusion|Construction deaths related to wind turbines are common.
13830| Wind energy|premise|There have been at least 40 fatalities due to construction, operation, and maintenance of wind turbines, including both workers and members of the public, and other injuries and deaths attributed to the wind power life cycle.
13831| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind turbines sometimes disintegrate, jeopardizing communities.
13831| Wind energy|premise|When a turbine's brake fails, the turbine can spin freely until it disintegrates, sending the blades significant distances, risking the lives of local communities.
13832| Wind energy|conclusion|Ice collects and is flung off of wind turbines.
13832| Wind energy|premise|"""Ice is another problem."
13833| Wind energy|conclusion|Wind energy obscures radar, a threat to national security.
13833| Wind energy|premise|On February 4, 2008, according to British Ministry of Defence turbines create a hole in radar coverage so that aircraft flying overhead are not detectable.
13834| Wind energy|conclusion|The focus should be on saving energy, not producing more by wind.
13834| Wind energy|premise|"""It is wise to diversify the sources of our energy."
13836| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The US tried and failed to secure a UN Security Council authorization for war.
13836| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The US actively attempted to pass a UN SC resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq.
13837| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|US justifications for war in Iraq were faulty, making a continued occupation baseless.
13837| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|America and its allies should never have invaded Iraq in the first place.
13838| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq War will be illegal after UN authorizations expire on January 1, 2009.
13838| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The UN has authorized the continued presence of coalition forces in Iraq.
13839| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Congress authorized the war for objectives that no longer exist.
13839| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in 2002 was for the removal of Saddam Hussein from office and the elimination of the supposed WMD threat.
13840| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|"The 2001 Congressional ""war on terror"" resolution does not authorize the Iraq War."
13840| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"The Bush administration has cited the ""war on terror"" legislation passed by the United States Congress weeks after the September 11th attacks as having warranted war in Iraq."
13842| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iraq never disarmed after Kuwait, inviting the use of force.
13842| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the UN-mandated, US-led expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, the UN passed resolution 687, which called for Iraq to disarm its WMD stockpiles, or face enforcement by ""all necessary means""."
13843| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|That Iraq did not actually have WMD highlights bad intelligence, not illegal acts.
13843| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Many intelligence reports and expert opinions internationally corroborated the analysis that Iraq had WMD prior to the 2003 invasion.
13844| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The UN continually concluded that Iraq was breaching its disarmament obligations.
13844| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The UN repeatedly noted Iraq's non-compliance with its disarmament obligations through the 90s, and authorized the use of force on a number of occasions.
13845| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Post-invasion UN resolutions authorized the presence of coalition forces in Iraq.
13845| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|While there may be some questions regarding the legal justifications for the invasion of Iraq, there is no question that the UN has provided resolutions authorizing the post-invasion presence of coalition forces in Iraq.
13846| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq war was fully justified at the time of the decision based on the evidence.
13846| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Saddam Hussein's brutal regime did pose a threat to regional stability and to its own people.
13847| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Saddam Hussein would have re-started Iraq's WMD program some-day.
13847| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The evidence suggests that if sanctions had been lifted and no action taken, Saddam Hussein would have restarted Iraq's WMD programs.
13849| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The US has to make the best of Iraq irrespective of faulty justifications going in.
13849| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|While the justifications can be debated until the cows come home, the reality in Iraq and the US presence there must be addressed at face value.
13851| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The domino theory relies on a highly questionable notion of Iraq turning Islamist.
13851| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The domino theory depends on the premise that, if the US withdraws, Iraq will turn into an Islamist country, which will then cause other countries to become increasingly Islamist.
13852| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|We should trust that democracy will appeal to Muslims no matter what happens in Iraq.
13852| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|To argue that the success of democracy in the Middle East and in the Muslim world depends on the results of the Iraq War, is to argue that democracy does not have its own inherent appeal.
13854| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Iraq would undermine democracies in region.
13854| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Those who advocate a quick withdrawal without offering a realistic solution to the crises seem to over look the consequences of the future U."
13855| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq War has damaged US international security leverage in the world.
13855| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Some argue that withdrawing from Iraq would cause the United States to be seen as feckless.
13856| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Iraq would restore US credibility not undermine it.
13856| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Calls to maintain the status quo echo the same rationale used to keep us in Vietnam."
13857| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq War has hamstrung US Middle East policy.
13857| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Not only has Iraq drained US resources and military capacity, but it has also dominated its diplomatic and policy attention.
13858| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The world wants the US to withdraw from Iraq and would support its decision to do so.
13858| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The vast majority of the world publics and leaders desire that the United States leave Iraq.
13859| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Torturous and brutal tactics in Iraq have only worsened US moral credibility.
13859| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Outrage at foreign occupation has been multiplied by brutal American tactics, from the use of degrading torture at Abu Ghraib to the recent discovery that phosphorus weapons were used against civilians in Fallujah.
13860| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The US has accomplished its limited strategic objectives in Iraq, so it can leave.
13860| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Saddam has been removed from office and executed, WMD has not been found, and Iraq is no longer a threat to the region.
13861| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|"The US is subjecting itself to ""imperial overstretch"" in Iraq."
13861| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|This is a classic phenomena with great powers, in which they engage in unnecessary wars at far greater cost than was ever initially imagined, leading to the weakening of the state and a fall from grace.
13862| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|"A policy of ""containing"" fundamentalism would successfully follow withdrawing from Iraq."
13862| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"The policy of ""containment"" in the Cold War was a success."
13863| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq War has decreased oil production in Iraq rather than secured it.
13863| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Invading Iraq was - at least with nods and winks - secure US and coalition oil interests in a country with the second to third largest oil reserves in the world.
13864| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Enemies of the US would view an early withdrawal from Iraq as a sign of fecklessness.
13864| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|A coalition withdrawal from Iraq would be seen as a sign of weakness.
13865| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early withdrawal from Iraq would undermine US credibility with allies.
13865| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""A politically driven pullout would be a military disasterA political pullout would send a dangerous signal of weakness and fecklessness to both our allies and enemies""."
13866| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iraq is a pillar of American strategy in the Middle East that should not be abandoned.
13866| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"Senator John McCain, April 2008 - ""The fact is, we now have a great opportunity, not only to bring stability and freedom to Iraq, but to make Iraq a pillar of our future strategy for the entire region of the greater Middle East."
13867| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|If the US withdraws early from Iraq, it will have to return to fight again.
13867| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|John McCain.
13868| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|A premature US withdrawal would jeopardize world oil supplies.
13868| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|If chaos ensues in Iraq, the risk is not simply that a civil war, genocide, and perhaps a regional conflict ensue.
13869| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing would be counter to US and allied oil-interests in Iraq.
13869| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The US and its allies, having invested so much into Iraq, should reap the benefits of Iraq's oil reserves.
13870| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Succeeding in Iraq will help justify the war and those who supported it.
13870| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Getting out too soon will simply reinforce the views of those who thought the invasion wrong in the first place.
13871| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|"The ""domino theory"" in a post-Iraq-withdrawal Middle East is as illegitimate as it was with Vietnam."
13871| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Many argue that if coalition forces withdraw prematurely from Iraq that Iraq will fall subject to Islamism and tyranny and that, in a domino effect, so too will other Middle Eastern countries fall.
13872| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The death toll following the US withdrawal from Vietnam was not bad.
13872| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|While hundreds of thousands, and even millions, of people died in Vietnam and Cambodia after the US withdrew, hundreds of thousands and even millions died while the US was there too.
13873| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Vietnam did not undercut US credibility and it won't in Iraq either.
13873| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Opponents of withdrawing from Vietnam in the late 60s and early 70s almost all argued that it would damage US credibility in the international arena.
13874| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Success in the Middle East will be achieved like in South East Asia.
13874| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|US analysts feared withdrawing from Vietnam on the basis that it would undermine the future of US policies in South East Asia.
13875| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Vietnam was a mistake and so should be avoided in Iraq.
13875| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Ironically, many of the same liberals who demand an immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq are the same ones who believe they are great protectors of human rights and also suffer from the dream that America’s withdrawal from Vietnam was justified and made Southeast Asia a better place."
13889| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Foreign troops are doing more harm than good in Iraq.
13889| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|This is a common argument against the continued presence of coalition forces in Iraq.
13890| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Iraq would remove the rallying cause of the insurgency.
13890| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"An insurgency exists in Iraq, in large part, to expel ""occupying"" US forces."
13891| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The US presence in Iraq has drawn in tens of thousands of foreign fighters.
13891| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"The US presence has created a regional reaction against the ""invaders"" and ""crusaders""."
13892| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Sunni insurgents are too weak to seize Baghdad following a US withdrawal.
13892| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Shiites and Kurds, in addition to loyal Iraq soldiers, are more powerful in number and in arms than Sunni insurgents.
13893| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early US withdrawal from Iraq would boost the morale of insurgents.
13893| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|If the insurgency saw the US leave Iraq, they would feel that they had achieved a success.
13894| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Following a withdrawal, insurgents would attack the Iraqi government and troops.
13894| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Some argue that a US withdrawal would eliminate the cause celebre of the insurgency.
13895| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early US exit would demoralize Iraqi troops.
13895| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Iraqi troops need the support and training of US troops.
13896| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early US exit might cause Iraqi troops to defect to the insurgency.
13896| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|If a US exit subjects Iraqi troops to greater risk, it is likely that many of them will simply quite or join with the insurgency.
13897| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|A US troop presence in Iraq provides terrorists with a justification for their presence among Iraqis.
13897| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Most Iraqis oppose the US occupation of Iraq, some to the extent that they are willing to support the cause of the insurgency.
13898| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|A US withdrawal might embolden Jihadists, but they are insignificant in Iraq.
13898| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The proportion of the fighters in Iraq that are driven by a Jihadist/terrorists cause is very small.
13900| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Al Qaeda is powerless to establish a caliphate in Iraq after a US withdrawal.
13900| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Al Qaeda does not have a prominent presence in Iraq among the various armed factions.
13901| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iraqi Sunnis would mainly oppose Al Qaeda after the US leaves.
13901| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The majority of Iraqi Sunnis, while they support anti-occupation insurgents, do not support Al Qaeda's mission of a continuing Jihad against the West.
13902| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Al Qaeda in Iraq  is not coordinated with Al Qaeda at large.
13902| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|AQI emerged in Iraq as a fairly independent organization from Al Qaeda.
13903| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iraq is only a jihadist-terrorist threat because US troops are there to be targeted.
13903| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|If US troops leave, there will no longer be a foreign target for terrorists in Iraq and from the region.
13904| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The US can back anti-terrorism efforts in and around Iraq after leaving.
13904| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The US will, after leaving, still be able to support Iraqi security forces in their fight against Al Qaeda.
13905| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Coalition troops in Iraq fuel anti-Americanism and terrorism globally.
13905| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Foreign troops in Iraq anger Muslims and Muslim terrorists globally.
13906| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq War has distracted attention away from the War on Terror.
13906| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Withdrawal would make it easier for an over-stretched America to focus on a broader anti-terrorism strategy, aimed at building democracies and promoting human rights in the Middle East and elsewhere.
13907| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Occupying Iraq makes the USA and its allies targets for terrorist attack throughout the world.
13907| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The Madrid and London bombings, as well as attacks on coalition interests worldwide (e.
13908| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Mending relations with countries that opposed the war would make it easier to fight the war on terror.
13908| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Mending relations with the Arab and Muslim world, as well as the many other countries which opposed the war would make it easier to fight the war on terror.
13909| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|It is wrong to believe that we need to fight terrorists in Iraq to prevent them from coming to the US.
13909| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Some proponents of the war argue that it is necessary to fight terrorists in Iraq so that they don't come across the Atlantic to the United States.
13910| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Iraq may embolden terrorists, but the war itself emboldens them.
13910| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Critics of a withdrawal often argue that it would embolden terrorists.
13911| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early withdrawal from Iraq would embolden terrorists.
13911| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"Withdrawing from Iraq would concede a major victory to terrorists around the world that would be used as evidence of the ""success"" of a global Jihadi movement and would be used to advance the continuation of the war on broader fronts and theaters around the world, particularly in inspiring recruits to join the fight."
13912| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The war in Iraq is a central front in the war on Islamic fundamentalism.
13912| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Islamic fundamentalism is the biggest threat facing the United States, coalition countries, the West, and democracies around the world.
13913| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Al Qaeda has made Iraq a central front and they must be stopped there.
13913| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Many would perceive a sudden U."
13914| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|If the US withdraws from Iraq, it will become an Islamist base for Al Qaeda.
13914| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""The consequences of leaving Iraq prematurely could be a radical Islamic regime funded with oil revenues, an unfettered platform for terrorist attacks, destabilizing the Middle East and threatening America itself."
13915| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Once the US leaves, terrorists will launch a massive, violent campaign.
13915| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The terrorists in Iraq are just waiting for the United States to leave.
13916| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early US withdrawal would enable Al Qaeda to use Iraqi oil revenue.
13916| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|If the US withdrew from Iraq, there will be far fewer regulations of the oil revenues coming out of Iraq's oil industry.
13917| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early withdrawal from Iraq would hurt US credibility in the War on Terror.
13917| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|By withdrawing before the job is done, the United States would give the impression that it is an unreliable friend and ally in the war on terror and on any front.
13918| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq war has not made us more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than before.
13918| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|We were already targets.
13919| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|A coalition timetable would force Iraqis to come together and work faster.
13919| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Iraqi politicians over-rely on US security forces.
13920| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|There is no military solution in Iraq.
13920| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Many military and civilian leaders have stated that there is no military solution in Iraq; that a political solution is the only possible solution.
13921| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Coalition forces harm the popular legitimacy of Iraqi leaders that work with them.
13921| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The vast majority of Iraqis are opposed to the American occupation.
13922| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraqi people and government are full capable of providing for their own security.
13922| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"Sheikh Sabeeh al-Ani, chief of the al-Ani tribe, said in 2007 - ""I think Iraq is full of sincere and capable people who will run the country successfully without US protection and support."
13923| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Political progress lends as much to the notion of withdrawing as staying.
13923| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Iraq has a new, elected government, and has successfully voted in a referendum on a new, relatively liberal constitution.
13925| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawal from Iraq would crush moderates, embolden extremists.
13925| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"Dick Cheney said to AIPAC in March 2007 - ""Moderates would be crushed, Shiite extremists backed by Iran would be in an all-out war with Sunni extremists led by Al-Qaida and remnants of the old Saddam regime."
13926| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early withdrawal would destroy Iraq's nascent government.
13926| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|An early US withdrawal would force the Iraqi government to maintain its security.
13927| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Political progress has been made but must be continued with coalition support.
13927| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Although the constitution and formation of a legitimate government are major achievements, there is still much work to do.
13928| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Despite promising developments, it is unrealistic to expect Iraq's own forces to be able to take over fully in the near future.
13928| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|As regional police forces gain confidence and experience, and as individual army battalions become trained, properly equipped and battle-ready, then a gradual withdrawal of coalition troops can take place over the course of the next few years.
13929| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early US withdrawal would undermine international support for the Iraqi government.
13929| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|International support for the Iraqi government is largely predicated on US involvement in the country as well as the legitimacy that the US presence lends.
13930| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Sputtering Iraqi economy requires indefinite US presence.
13930| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Economic crisis in Iraq The state of the Iraqi economy gives Iraqis little incentive to work to preserve it."
13931| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iraq contains oil reserves critical to global economy.
13931| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""While its proven oil reserves of 112 billion barrels ranks Iraq second in the work behind Saudi Arabia, EIA estimates that up to 90-percent of the county remains unexplored due to years of wars and sanctions"" ."
13932| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|"Limited ""success"" of surge only feeds false hopes in Iraq."
13932| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""In retrospect we can see that it was precisely the early U."
13935| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Case against Iraq withdrawal relies on fear mongering.
13935| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in a March 30th, 2008 Washington Post article, ""The contrast between the Democratic argument for ending the war and the Republican argument for continuing is sharp and dramatic."
13936| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Claims that disaster would follow withdrawal are made by discredited advocates of invasion.
13936| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""The growing demand by the American people for us to leave Iraq prompts the naysayers to predict disaster in the Middle East if we do."
13937| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Once the US begins to leave, Iraqi's will take control of their own security.
13937| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|While many argue that the current Iraqi forces are incapable of securing Iraq currently, it is frequently noted that they rely too heavily on US military and government support.
13938| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early US withdrawal from Iraq would be generally disastrous.
13938| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""The administration's critics, meanwhile, have offered as their alternative 'strategy' an accelerated timetable for withdrawal."
13939| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Coalition withdrawal is more likely to damage Iraq than help it.
13939| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""The strong case is that if America leaves, things will get even worse."
13940| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Reports concluding that an early withdrawal from Iraq would be disastrous.
13940| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"A Institute of Peace report on April 6th, 2008 warned that a fast exit from Iraq ""risks a complete failure of the Iraqi state, massive chaos and even genocide."
13941| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Iraq prematurely would be as disastrous as withdrawing from Vietnam.
13941| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|It would result in a genocide on par with the genocide in Cambodia following the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam.
13969| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Turkey is unlikely to intervene if the Kurds secede.
13969| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Turkey is more concerned with its EU membership than dealing with the Kurds.
13970| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing coalition troops from Iraq would increase the likelihood of a civil war between Kurds and Arabs.
13970| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Neither Sunnis nor Shiites have forgotten that the Kurds supported Iran in its war against Iraq in the early 1980s.
13971| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|No evidence that Iraq War has weakened Iran.
13971| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""There is no indication that the U."
13972| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iraqi nationalism will prevent Iranian influence after US withdrawal.
13972| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Would Iran effectively take over Iraq?  No."
13973| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iranian influence in Iraq is limited because Iraqi Shiites are Arab not Persian.
13973| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|It is important to note that Iraqi Shiite are Arab while Iranian Shiite are Persian.
13974| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Staying in Iraq risks starting a war with Iran.
13974| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The United States is more likely to start a war with Iran while it is in Iraq, simply because the potential for armed conflict across the border is more likely.
13975| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq War has benefited Iran by eliminating its Iraqi adversaries.
13975| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Historically, Iraq has been Iran's primary adversary, with the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) being the primary, bloody, expression of that adversarial relationship.
13976| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Iraq War has benefited Iran by distracting and weakening its US adversaries.
13976| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The United States is Iran's other main adversary.
13977| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Iran's influence in Iraq would grow significantly if the United States withdraws.
13977| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|If the United States withdraws from Iraq, it will be much easier for Iran to project its influence there.
13978| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Iraq will damage the United States' ability to deal with Iran.
13978| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Olmert said in remarks to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in March 2007.
13979| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|US leaders should not honor dead soldiers by keeping live ones in harms way.
13979| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"As some people have put it, ""supporting the troops means withdrawing them""."
13980| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|American soldiers would rather leave Iraq than stay.
13980| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""For the first time since Vietnam, an organized, robust movement of active-duty US military personnel has publicly surfaced to oppose a war in which they are serving."
13981| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Setting a timetable would boost troop morale not damage it.
13981| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Under the assumption that most troops in Iraq are suffering from severe anxiety, psychiatric trauma, and risk of death, it is no surprise that troops would prefer to come home.
13982| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Keeping troops in Iraq beyond their call of duty is an abuse not an honor.
13982| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Gen."
13983| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|"Hiding behind ""support the troops"" abrogates the responsibilities of command."
13983| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Commanding troops means making the choice to put them in harms way or withdrawal them from harms way.
13984| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Keeping troops in Iraq is obviously more dangerous than a rapid withdrawal.
13984| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|It is odd to argue that a rapid withdraw would be risky to the lives of troops.
13986| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Honoring the fallen requires that US troops remain to see victory through in Iraq.
13986| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|If the United States prematurely withdraws from Iraq, what will the dead have died for? Nothing.
13987| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|US troops want to find meaning in their sacrifices in Iraq by finishing the mission.
13987| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Living US troops have sacrificed greatly in Iraq.
13988| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Many US troops see an on-the-ground need for their continued presence there.
13988| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Having seen the faces of Iraqis and having become accustomed to the important role US troops play in helping them in their fight to stabilize their country, many US troops reject the notion of withdrawing prematurely; they know that Iraq needs them.
13989| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|A hasty withdrawal from Iraq could risk the lives of coalition troops.
13989| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Any hasty retreat is risky for troops, as positions are given up, and as some forces remain behind and vulnerable in a staged retreat.
13990| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Prolonging the Iraq War will permanently damaged the US military.
13990| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Our capacity to respond with overwhelming force has been a powerful deterrent."
13991| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|An early withdrawal from Iraq would be highly risky to exiting troops.
13991| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Retired Maj.
13992| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|War in Iraq is a cause of US economic recession.
13992| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""Economic costs."
13993| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Withdrawing from Iraq would provide a needed stimulus to the US economy.
13993| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"An associated press/ipsos poll revealed a majority of Americans to be convinced that the most reasonable ""stimulus"" for the U."
13994| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Deficit spending in Iraq is not what is causing the economy to recede in the status quo.
13994| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|rather, basic economic principles dictate that in a time of recession, deficit spending (like Iraq) actually helps the economy.
13995| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|You cannot put a price on freedom and security.
13995| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|We should be proud that our nations, and their armed forces have risen to the challenge of rebuilding Iraq, and confident that their brave efforts will make the world both safer and freer.
13996| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The 2002 Congressional war-authorization does not cover the current scope of the Iraq War.
13996| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) does not provide authorization for the current War in Iraq.
13997| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force provides a continued mandate for the war.
13997| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|When Congress passed the Authorization for the Use of Military Force, it provided the president with the authorization to go to war in Iraq.
13998| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The majority of Americans want troops to withdraw from Iraq on a timetable.
13998| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|According to a Rasmussen Report in April of 2008, between 57 percent and 64 percent of Americans want all U.
13999| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Americans would not have supported the Iraq War if they'd known what it would become.
13999| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"""if the American people had been asked more than five years ago whether Bush’s obsession with the removal of Saddam Hussein was worth 4,000 American lives, almost 30,000 wounded Americans and several trillion dollars — not to mention the less precisely measurable damage to the United States’ world-wide credibility, legitimacy and moral standing — the answer almost certainly would have been an unequivocal 'no."
14000| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Americans are increasingly optimistic about the prospects for success in Iraq.
14000| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|"A Pew Research Centre March 2008 poll found that 53 percent of Americans believed ""the US will ultimately succeed in achieving its goals"", up from 42 per cent six months prior to the poll."
14001| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|The Commander in Chief is given executive authority to prosecute the Iraq War.
14001| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|The Commander in Chief in America is given substantial authority to prosecute wars in the interest of national security.
14002| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|Public opinion in coalition countries is moving strongly in favour of withdrawing forces from Iraq as soon as possible.
14002| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|There is danger in governments running foreign policies which lack a basis of popular support.
14003| Withdrawing from Iraq|conclusion|While publics do want the US to leave, they also express a desire to see a stable Iraq.
14003| Withdrawing from Iraq|premise|Citizens expect their government to provide strong leadership, taking difficult decisions and staying the course even in adversity.
14005| Women in combat|conclusion|Many military women are more physically capable of meeting performance targets then men in combat roles.
14005| Women in combat|premise|In general, it is easy to find, recruit, and deploy women who are in better shape than many men we send into combat.
14006| Women in combat|conclusion|The modern high technology battlefield increasingly means that technical expertise and decision-making skills are more valuable than simple brute strength.
14006| Women in combat|premise|Women may even demonstrate a higher affinity for the details and organization thinking demanded in technical expertise and decision-making.
14008| Women in combat|conclusion|Women, some studies have shown, can perform as well as, if not better than men.
14008| Women in combat|premise|In active combat, several Soviet women distinguished themselves as fighter aces-the elite of combat aviators.
14009| Women in combat|conclusion|While the vast proportion of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited.
14009| Women in combat|premise|While some women are able to meet the absolute physical requirements for front-line combat such as carrying a wounded soldier, throwing grenades or digging a trench in hard terrain, most are not.
14010| Women in combat|conclusion|Including women would be a means to combating falling retention rates in some militaries.
14010| Women in combat|premise|Widening the applicant pool for all jobs guarantees more willing recruits.
14011| Women in combat|conclusion|Women are not able to climb rank without combat experience.
14011| Women in combat|premise|Combat duty is usually regarded as necessary for promotion to senior officer positions, denying female personnel this experience ensures that very few will ever reach the highest reaches of the military and so further entrenches sexism.
14012| Women in combat|conclusion|Women are vitally needed for Low-intensity conflicts.
14012| Women in combat|premise|LICs require tasks to “win hearts and minds” such as intelligence gathering, medical assistance, policing, and mediation, as well as the ability to kill an opponent in close combat.
14013| Women in combat|conclusion|Men are likely to act foolishly to protect women in their combat units.
14013| Women in combat|premise|This may lead to resentment of women’s presence and harassment.
14014| Women in combat|conclusion|Men, especially those likely to enlist, maintain traditional gender roles in a heavily masculine military subculture.
14014| Women in combat|premise|As more women enter the armed services, abuse incidents rise.
14015| Women in combat|conclusion|Much has been made on integration’s effect on morale and readiness.
14015| Women in combat|premise|While the kind of widespread infighting caused by ‘competition for female affection’ claimed by alarmists is unlikely in the face of military discipline, the maintenance of active combat relationships does weaken the will to fight.
14016| Women in combat|conclusion|Biological arguments can be enlisted in the case against women in front line combat.
14016| Women in combat|premise|Pregnancy is already a problem in the military, reducing unit readiness.
14020| Women in combat|conclusion|Most Countries that have included women in combat roles have appealed them as well.
14020| Women in combat|premise|Russia used women in many different battles during WWII and saw great things with the all female unites.
14042| Year-round school|conclusion|Studies find year-round schools improve student performance.
14042| Year-round school|premise|Reports from the California State Department Of Education show that standardized test scores increased an average of 9.
14043| Year-round school|conclusion|9-month schooling crams too much info into shorter period.
14043| Year-round school|premise|"""The third problem is insufficient learning time."
14044| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round school's frequent vacations help refresh students.

14045| Year-round school|premise|"""Recent studies suggest that year-round schools do not improve education."
14046| Year-round school|conclusion|Many conclude year-round schooling worsens student achievement.
14046| Year-round school|premise|Opponents insist that year-round education is detrimental to student learning.
14047| Year-round school|conclusion|"""Summer learning loss"" harms poor students most."
14047| Year-round school|premise|"""Summer learning loss also widens the gap between rich and poor children because disadvantaged kids are less likely to have books at home to help maintain skills and knowledge."
14048| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round school is not uniquely helpful to at-risk students.
14048| Year-round school|premise|"""Of concern to any school system is the low achievement of at-risk students."
14049| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round schooling offers three month-long breaks.
14049| Year-round school|premise|Instead of having summer break for 3 months year long school would have school for 3 months and a month of break.
14050| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round schools have same overall schooling and vacation time.
14050| Year-round school|premise|Year-round schooling means schools continue to operate on a 180 school-day system, yet they spread these days out differently with shorter breaks between each term.
14051| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round school and vacations offer more balanced life-style.
14051| Year-round school|premise|"""The year-round calendar is organized into instructional periods and vacation weeks that are more evenly balanced across 12 months than the traditional school calendar."
14052| Year-round school|conclusion|The summer camp industry will not be hurt.
14052| Year-round school|premise|Summer camps will have the same amount of time to operate, only spread throughout the year.
14053| Year-round school|conclusion|Students get bored during the long break of summer.
14053| Year-round school|premise|Most students get bored during summer vacations, when there is much less activity and stimulation.
14054| Year-round school|conclusion|Many school buildings are not built for summer use.
14054| Year-round school|premise|One of the historical reasons for avoiding school during summer was the lack of air conditioning during summer months.
14055| Year-round school|conclusion|Summer youth programs suffer from year-round schooling.
14055| Year-round school|premise|Youth summer camps rely on the existence of year-round schooling systems with summer breaks.
14056| Year-round school|conclusion|It would anger nearly all school children.
14056| Year-round school|premise|Going to school every day for 13 years would anger and outrage almost every school child in the world.
14057| Year-round school|conclusion|Some children may get bored during summer-break, but more keep busy.
14057| Year-round school|premise|Juniors need to do college search, a wide range of students have summer jobs, etc.
14058| Year-round school|conclusion|Summer-breaks are an antiquated extension of farming culture.
14058| Year-round school|premise|"""The traditional school calendar was devised mainly to serve the needs of farmers who needed the help of their youngsters during the summer."
14059| Year-round school|conclusion|Opponents of year-round schooling are simply intolerant of change.
14059| Year-round school|premise|"""It takes time to widely change an education program that has been used in this country for many decades."
14060| Year-round school|conclusion|Changing to year-round schooling has significant costs.
14060| Year-round school|premise|Resistance to change, in the case of moving to year-round schooling, is justified on the basis of the actual costs of adjusting to change.
14061| Year-round school|conclusion|Teachers in year-round school districts prefer their system.
14061| Year-round school|premise|Surveys in year-round districts indicate that between 60% to 90% of teachers prefer year-round education.
14062| Year-round school|conclusion|Teachers need summer vacation to stay sane and focused.
14062| Year-round school|premise|Teaching is a very difficult profession.
14063| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round schooling impairs summer teacher development.
14063| Year-round school|premise|The summer time is a good opportunity for teachers to seek additional training and develop their skills.
14064| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round schools are growing in number and succeeding.
14064| Year-round school|premise|"""In Minnesota there are 27 year-round educational programs."
14066| Year-round school|conclusion|Not-using schools in the summer is generally inefficient.
14066| Year-round school|premise|During summer breaks, school facilities sit un-used.
14067| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round school is key in an increasingly competitive world.
14067| Year-round school|premise|"""In an increasingly competitive world, it's time we gave our children every advantage and it's clear that means year-round schooling."
14068| Year-round school|conclusion|Summer is the peak time for the tourism industry.
14068| Year-round school|premise|With this blow to tourism, many companies will not survive.
14069| Year-round school|conclusion|The tourism industry may benefit from year-round schooling.
14069| Year-round school|premise|from the spread of breaks throughout the year.
14070| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round schooling avoids the problem of summer-vacation surges.
14070| Year-round school|premise|It's easier to schedule vacations under a year-round schooling system because not everyone wants to travel at the same time.
14071| Year-round school|conclusion|Areas that depend heavily on summer tourism will suffer economically.
14071| Year-round school|premise|Cottage areas typically swell in population by five to ten times during the summer months, generally with regular cottagers.
14072| Year-round school|conclusion|Students and parents don't have to continuously buy school supplies.
14072| Year-round school|premise|There are financial benefits to not using year round schooling because you don't have to buy as many school supplies.
14073| Year-round school|conclusion|Year-round schooling damages summer-break student employment.
14073| Year-round school|premise|The summer-time is an important opportunity for students to earn some money and gain some experience in the work-force.

14081| Year-round school|premise|By putting children on different educational schedules, multi-tracking risks segmenting generations of students in alienating ways.
14083| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|conclusion|Canceling Yucca Mountain facility is a legal liability.
14083| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|If the U.
14084| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|conclusion|Nuclear needed to replace hydrocarbons.
14084| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|There is a major need for emissions-free alternatives to fossil fuels, both due to climate change, and due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources.
14085| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|conclusion|Nuclear waste should not be created in the first place.
14085| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|"Kevin Kamps, a radioactive-waste expert at the environmental group Beyond Nuclear, ""is that we should not be creating this material to begin with."
14086| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|conclusion|Nuclear doesn't emit carbon, but does emit other dangerous waste.
14086| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|"""Nuclear plants are indeed vastly preferable to coal-fired plants from the standpoint of carbon dioxide emissions."
14087| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|conclusion|Transport is safe.
14087| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|The U.
14088| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|conclusion|Yucca Mountain is much safer than the status quo of nuclear storage.
14088| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|"""Our longstanding support of the Yucca Mountain facility has been grounded in the belief that the center of a desert mountain 1,000 feet underground and more than 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas was an appropriate place for the nation's nuclear waste."

14090| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|Transporting nuclear waste hundreds and even thousands of miles across the country to a single nuclear waste storage facility entails significant risks.
14091| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|conclusion|Nuclear power and Yucca can decrease dependence on foreign oil.
14091| Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|premise|Stopping Yucca Mountain would make us more dependable on fossil fuels, rather than paving the way for new nuclear developments.
14092| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Zero Tolerance policing helps deter criminal acts.
14092| Zero tolerance law|premise|i) It creates a far greater awareness of police presence because there are more officers on the ground.
14093| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Minor offenders, gang members, and the poor are unlikely to be aware of the punishments for the crimes which they commit, undermining the notion of zero-tolerance deterring crime among these groups.
14093| Zero tolerance law|premise|Many crimes are a product of necessity (through poverty and drugs) and therefore can be reduced only by structural changes to the society, not by threatening punishment.
14094| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Zero tolerance policing is extremely effective at reducing small-scale drug use and dealing by patrolling and arresting.
14094| Zero tolerance law|premise|By cutting off the dealer on the ground we can best target the businesses of big suppliers.
14095| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Arresting small-scale pushers  and users is targeting the victims to stop the crime.
14095| Zero tolerance law|premise|As well as being unfair it is ineffective.
14096| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Zero tolerance also allows for a sound rehabilitative role.
14096| Zero tolerance law|premise|A custodial sentence, particularly for juveniles, takes them out of the atmosphere (often surrounded by drug use and living in poverty and or abusive homes) that encourage criminality.
14097| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Prison sentences contribute to a far higher tendency to re-offend.
14097| Zero tolerance law|premise|It would be nice if they had a rehabilitative role but we have to look at the reality.
14098| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Zero Tolerance improves the standard of policing.
14098| Zero tolerance law|premise|It reduces corruption and racist treatment because the individual officers are not given the scope to decide their actions on a case by case basis.
14099| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Zero Tolerance can lead to police profiling of certain groups and the abuse of authority.
14099| Zero tolerance law|premise|Under zero tolerance laws, police are are able to stop and search, and even harass individuals constantly.
14100| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Zero Tolerance is vital to regenerate urban environments.
14100| Zero tolerance law|premise|There is no point building in inner cities if we don’t protect these resources from graffiti and vandalism.
14101| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Urban regeneration occurs independently of zero tolerance, although it is one of the most powerful ways of targeting crime.
14101| Zero tolerance law|premise|For every city where the two have both been associated with a falling crime rate (New York) there is an area where regeneration has worked on its own to solve a crime problem (Hong Kong, Brixton in London).
14102| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|Zero tolerance is affordable, saves costs, and actually helps stimulate economies.
14102| Zero tolerance law|premise|Protecting businesses and creating a reputation for low crime and sound policing attracts inward investment and immigration both to a country as a whole and to individual areas.
14103| Zero tolerance law|conclusion|The expense of zero tolerance in money and manpower and prisons actually makes policing worse.
14103| Zero tolerance law|premise|Either we have to throw limitless money at doubling the number of officers (it is almost impossible to recruit and train so many even if we could afford it).
14104| Zoos|conclusion|Despite good intentions of zoo-keepers, animals in zoos suffer.
14104| Zoos|premise|They are inevitably confined in unnaturally small spaces, and are kept from the public by cages and bars.
14105| Zoos|conclusion|Bad zookeeping can be regulated and weeded out.
14105| Zoos|premise|There have in the past been many bad zoos and cruel zookeepers.
14106| Zoos|conclusion|If nature was appropriately preserved, we would not need zoos.
14106| Zoos|premise|"Michael Fox, Sierra, November-December 1990 - ""Zoos are becoming facsimiles - or perhaps caricatures - of how animals once were in their natural habitat."
14107| Zoos|conclusion|Zoos exist simply to amuse the paying public.
14107| Zoos|premise|Call it what it is.
14108| Zoos|conclusion|Zoos help protect animals from predators.
14108| Zoos|premise|Animals kept in zoos would have once been in the wild where Survivial of the Fittest takes the lead.
14109| Zoos|conclusion|Many zoos have large, life-like enclosures.
14109| Zoos|premise|Many zoos do not lock animals up in cages.
14110| Zoos|conclusion|Most of the animals that you see in zoos aren't endangered.
14110| Zoos|premise|While some argue that zoos are a means to protecting endangered species, the reality is that very few animals in zoos are actually endangered.
14111| Zoos|conclusion|Zoos are not capable of sustaining all endangered species.
14111| Zoos|premise|According to the World Conservation Union which keeps records of endangered species, there are 5428 threatened animals on a recent 'red list'.
14112| Zoos|conclusion|Zoos help protect endangered species.
14112| Zoos|premise|Zoos are a good place to house endangered species, help them breed, and help move toward their reintroduction back into their natural habitat.
14113| Zoos|conclusion|Zoos help breed endangered animals.
14113| Zoos|premise|If natural or human factors have made a species' own habitat a threatening environment then human intervention can preserve that species where it would certainly go extinct if there were no intervention.
14114| Zoos|conclusion|Zoos can raise awareness of endangered species.
14114| Zoos|premise|Visitors to zoos may raise their awareness of endangered species by being directly exposed to them.
