there may be a, shall we say, pink elephant in the room when it comes to the legalization of marijuana.  [nonconclusion] 

First let us talk about the risks.  [nonconclusion] 

Quebeckers are aware of them.  [nonconclusion] 

Some of those risks include normalization of marijuana use, public health impacts, and increased use by our young people, just to name a few.  [nonconclusion]

The opening of this new market should benefit more than just the Liberals' friends.  [nonconclusion] 

As we have seen, almost every cannabis company has a former minister or well-known Liberal on its board of directors.  [nonconclusion] 

If we vote to legalize marijuana, it must be done right.  [conclusion] 

It must not have a negative impact on our young people or the general public, and it must certainly not be done just to benefit the Liberals' friends.  [conclusion] 

The government has not yet done anything to address Quebeckers' concerns or to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.  [nonconclusion] 

Things are off to a bad start.  [conclusion]
