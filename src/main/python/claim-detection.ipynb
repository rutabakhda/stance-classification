There are economists who doubt it's possible for the government to effectively stimulate an economy of such size and complexity. Those economists, however, are in the minority.

But not just any jobs - jobs that meet the needs we've neglected for far too long and lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth: jobs fixing our schools; computerizing medical records to save costs and save lives; repairing our infrastructure; and investing in renewable energy to help us move toward energy independence. The plan also calls for immediate tax relief for 95 percent of American workers.\"\n",

[...] Federal intervention rests on the presumption that officials know how to manage the economy and will use this knowledge effectively. This presumption always had a shaky foundation, and we have recently witnessed even more compelling evidence that the government simply does not know what it's doing. The big bailout bill enacted last October; the Federal Reserve's massive, frantic lending for many different purposes; and now the huge stimulus package all look like wild flailing - doing something mainly for the sake of being seen to be doing something - and, of course, enriching politically connected interests in the process.\"\n",

[...] Economic growth means an increase in the amount of wealth that exists in a country--and all wealth must be produced. [...] The focus of today's stimulus packages on consumer spending is therefore completely backward. Consumption is a consequence of production. This fact is ignored by the Bush plan [and Obama plan], which attempts to achieve prosperity through $100 billion in deficit-spending. Though this might bring the appearance of prosperity, in the same way that an unemployed man appears prosperous if he goes on a shopping spree with his credit cards, the reality will be the opposite.\"\n",

With consumers poorer from $6 trillion in vanished housing wealth and $7 trillion in vaporized stock, we're set to suffer annual losses in overall economic activity of a trillion dollars this year and a trillion or more next year. It's not just consumer spending that has collapsed. Other traditional generators of economic growth - business investment, housing construction, and exports - are all anemic. [...] That leaves government spending as the nation's best hope for softening a major downturn.\"\n",

It enters the financial system, where it is lent to others; or it is invested in the stock market as capital for businesses; or it is invested in entirely new businesses, which are the real drivers of job creation and prosperity. [...] At the current moment, amid a capital strike, the latter is the kind of fiscal stimulus we really need. Yet there is virtually none of it in the bills now moving through Congress. Senate moderates may succeed in cutting $100 billion or so in spending from the bill, which is political window dressing.

Willis Hawley, both Republicans, used similar logic to create the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, raising tariffs on foreign goods to record levels. President Herbert Hoover signed the bill against the opposition of more than 1,000 economists and numerous business executives. The result was a trade war with Europe, which increased its tariffs on U.S. products. Ultimately, U.S. exports and imports decreased by more than 50 percent in a single year, transforming the recession into the Great Depression [...] But at least Smoot-Hawley left open the freedom to import, whereas what the leadership of the 111th Congress originally wanted to eliminate imports outright.\"\n",

[...] A national Diageo/Hotline Poll shows 54 percent of registered voters favor the more than $800 billion stimulus package backed by President Barack Obama even if it means increasing the federal deficit. [...] Yet when the same poll asked voters if they thought the package of spending and tax cuts would be spent and managed wisely, 14 percent said they were 'very confident' it would. Twelve percent said they were 'very confident' the stimulus package would be effective in turning around the economy.

[...] This year's bank profits are windfalls in the purest sense. They aren't the due rewards for exceptional skill but gifts from taxpayers. Many banks are earning huge, risk-free profits borrowing from central banks at ultralow interest rates and lending back to governments at much-higher rates.

In particular, the expectation of a bailout when things go wrong will lead large financial institutions to grow too much and take on too much risk.

It's clear that during this last crisis the markets were incapable of assessing the risk that financial institutions were taking.

Paying out $10 billion a year is no sweat for an industry that, according to Goldman Sachs, made $250 billion in earnings before taxes and loan-loss provisions last year. And it won't drive up their funding costs by much. Goldman estimates $5.5 trillion of nondeposit liabilities at large banks.

[...] Nearly half of the mothers who give birth outside marriage are cohabiting with the child's father at the time of birth.15 These fathers, like the mothers, are typically in their early twenties. Out-of-wedlock childbearing is, thus, not the result of teenagers' lack of knowledge about birth control or a lack of availability of birth control. Rather, it is part of a crisis in the relationships of young adult men and women. Out-of-wedlock childbearing, in most cases, occurs because young adult men and women are unable to develop committed, loving marital relationships.

In return, we expect the same from Bosniak leaders: to clearly and unequivocally accept Republika Srpska.

Subsidisation is simply determined by the amount of tax raised and government expenditure spent in a given region, in Scotland this is actually quite close to zero (and is incomparable to regions of England, Wales and Northern Ireland). This does not include numerous other revenue streams from the Scottish territory, such as taxes on oil. In any case, it is the South East that 'subsidises' the rest of the UK. [...] Although it is reported that this subsidization does occur, this can only be identified by what the London-based (which is not a simplistic anti-English slur) Treasury calls 'identifiable expenditure'. \"Unidentifiable expenditure\" includes, for example, the olympics development in London (approx £10billion, half the annual Scottish Government's budget). Although Scotland may benefit from some of this 'unidentifiable expenditure' there is an assumption that expenditure spent on central government, by-and-large based in London, is as mutually beneficial to Scotland (and Wales, North West, Cumbria, etc) and the South East (the additional benefits of being the centre of government activity in the UK is assumed to be zero - which can reasonably be doubted by any impartial observor). In short, outside the South East - Scotland (including its territory) constitute one of the most productive regions of the country. In some ways, Scotland subsidises England by permitting significant operations to be commenced on its behalf in London and not in Edinburgh or Glasgow.\"\n",

That pol icy bases deterrence on the U.S. threatening to retal iate for a strategic attack on the U.S. or its allies with a devastating nuclear counterstrike. The U.S. needs to move toward a deterrence policy based on pro tecting and defending the people, territory, institu tions, and infrastructure of the U.S. and its allies against looming or attempted strategic attacks.[4] New START does nothing to facilitate this transition. The Senate can best remedy the flaw that New START does not move toward a defense-oriented deterrence policy by attaching a declaration to the resolution of ratification stating that the U.S. is com­mitted to defending its population, territory, institu tions, and infrastructure and those of its allies against strategic attack to the best of its ability.\"\n",

This fact is ignored by the Bush plan [and Obama plan], which attempts to achieve prosperity through $100 billion in deficit-spending.

Tangible proof of deterrence alone is not a valid reason for capital punishment (or any other form of punishment, for that matter), nor is it the main rationale employed by astute death penalty advocates. As Christian writer C.S. Lewis observes, '[deterrence] in itself, would be a very wicked thing to do. On the classical theory of punishment it was of course justified on the ground that the man deserved it. Why, in Heaven's name, am I to be sacrificed to the good of society in this way?-unless, of course, I deserve it.' Inflicting a penalty merely to deter -- rather than to punish for deeds done -- is the very definition of cruelty. A purely deterrent penalty is one where a man is punished -- not for something that he did -- but for something someone else might do. Lewis explained the logical end of this argument: 'If deterrence is all that matters, the execution of an innocent man, provided the public think him guilty, would be fully justified.'\" Men should be punished for their own crimes and not merely to deter others. That said, the death penalty undoubtedly does deter in some cases. For starters, those executed will no longer be around to commit any more crimes.\"\n",

(2267). John Paul II, writing in The Gospel of Life, stressed that 'the nature and extent of the punishment [for capital crimes] must be carefully evaluated and decided upon, and ought not to go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity; in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today however, as a result of steady improvements to the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent' (no. 56). In modern industrialized states, killing convicted murderers adds nothing to anyone’s safety. It is an excess. It cannot be justified except in the most extraordinary conditions.\"\n",

These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims, standards such as replication and basic comparisons with other scenarios. Some simple examples and contrasts, including a careful analysis of the experience in New York State compared to others, lead to a rejection of the idea that either death sentences or executions deter murder.\"\n",

It is important to note that 'homophobia' is not the cause of these disorders, as many of these studies were done in cultures in which homosexuality is widely accepted. Another recent study has shown that a high percentage, 32%, of males with SSA have been abused by other males with SSA.\" [find studies]\n",

The change in definition was meant to remove a legal \"wall\" between criminal investigations and surveillance for the purposes of gathering foreign intelligence, which hampered investigations when criminal and foreign surveillance overlapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "** - \"FISA expressly envisions a need for the President to conduct electronic surveillance outside of its provisions when a later statute authorizes that surveillance. The AUMF is such a statute [Sept 13, 2001 Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force]...The AUMF authorized the President to use 'all necessary and appropriate military force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided in the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.'...In its Hamdi decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the AUMF also authorizes the 'fundamental incident[s] of waging war.' The history of warfare makes clear that electronic surveillance of the enemy is a fundamental incident to the use of military force.\"\n",

      "- \"[Article II:] Designates president as commander-in-chief and gives him authority over foreign affairs. [President Bush] Says Article II gives the president 'all necessary authority' to protect the nation from further attacks. Argues that the president's power to conduct secret surveillance for the conduct of foreign affairs has long been recognized.\"                      - \"Circuit courts applying Keith to the foreign intelligence context have affirmed the existence of a foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement for searches conducted within the United States which target foreign powers or their agents. See United States v. Clay, 430 F.2d 165, 171 (5th Cir.1970); United States v. Brown, 484 F.2d 418, 426 (5th Cir.1973); United States v. Butenko, 494 F.2d 593, 605 (3d Cir.1974); United States v. Buck, 548 F.2d 871, 875 (9th Cir.1977); United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 913 (4th Cir.1980)\" Examination of the cases cited show the basis for this exception is the argument that the inherent power granted the executive under Article II of the Constitution. Congress may not by mere statute, abridge this power and therefore may not override the exemption to the warrantless search requirement affirmed by both the Court and exectutive precedent. In the same ruling, the Court found al-Qaeda to be a \"foreign power\" and thus it an its \"agents\" may be surveilled within the US without warrant.\"\n",

By invading Iraq in the manner it did, the U.S. exacerbated all of the threats it faced prior to 2003. Recruitment into terrorist cells shot up all over the world.

For example, a PBS poll last fall found that 58 percent of white evangelicals under age 30 favor some form of legal same-sex union.\" [This all suggests that civil unions will be met with greater respect from the general American population, instead of the kind of recrimination that can lead to hatred and descrimination.\n",

Highly increased and intensified Red Tide Blooms have been wreaking havoc on the west coast of Florida for the last ten years. The argument that red tide blooms cause no harm is ridiculous. Once the chain of a HAB gets started, no one knows how to end it. The Red Tide Bloom in Maine over the last three years is testament to this. Even though the water is too cold to be very favorable to red tide (K. Brevis), these Red Tide Blooms have flourished.

Thus, the two-state solution condemns Palestinian citizens of Israel to permanent second-class status within their homeland, in a racist state that denies their rights by enacting laws that privilege Jews constitutionally, legally, politically, socially and culturally.

Since the Six-Day War of June 1967, the two-state solution, based on the concept of 'land for peace,' has been the central focus of almost all diplomatic efforts to resolve this tragedy. But because of Israel's unrelenting occupation and settlement project in the West Bank, the long-fought-for two-state solution has finally, tragically, become unworkable. Consider: In 1993, when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat famously shook hands on the White House lawn, there were 109,000 Israelis living in settlements across the West Bank (not including Jerusalem). Today there are 275,000, in more than 230 settlements and strategically placed 'outposts' designed to cement a permanent Jewish presence on Palestinian land.\" [Forcibly removing these settlers would be too difficult, could foment a kind of Jewish civil war, and would create a level of resentment among fundamentalist Jews that would likely inflame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n",

      "Denying abortion rights forces maternity on women \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most famous arguments against abortion is the \"dialysis analogy\" put forward by Judith Jarvis in 1971. It compares abortion to a situation in which a healthy woman  is attached to a dying patient  in order to keep the dying patient alive. The concept is that the dying person does not have a right to the woman's body, and that the woman has a right to \"unplug\"  even if it means the death of the other person. The problem with the analogy is many fold: 1. A woman and a fetus have a special relationship that is incomparable to that between a woman and a stranger or even a relative. There is a special biological drive inside the mother to keep the baby alive and a dependency by the baby on the mother. The mother, therefore, has a special responsibility to keep her child alive and not abort; 2. A woman often gives a form of tacit approval to the existence of a fetus in her womb: the act of engaging in sexual behavior; 3. abortion directly kills the embryo and does not merely \"unplug\" and let it die. These are critical differences that invalidate a classic, central argument for abortion.\n",

      "One of the most famous arguments against abortion is the \"dialysis analogy\" put forward by Judith Jarvis in 1971. It compares abortion to a situation in which a healthy woman  is attached to a dying patient  in order to keep the dying patient alive. The concept is that the dying person does not have a right to the woman's body, and that the woman has a right to \"unplug\"  even if it means the death of the other person. The problem with the analogy is many fold: 1. A woman and a fetus have a special relationship that is incomparable to that between a woman and a stranger or even a relative. There is a special biological drive inside the mother to keep the baby alive and a dependency by the baby on the mother. The mother, therefore, has a special responsibility to keep her child alive and not abort; 2. A woman often gives a form of tacit approval to the existence of a fetus in her womb: the act of engaging in sexual behavior; 3. abortion directly kills the embryo and does not merely \"unplug\" and let it die. These are critical differences that invalidate a classic, central argument for abortion.\n",

According the Congressional Budget Office, if Congress enacts President Obama’s 2012 budget, interest payments on accumulated deficits will total $931 billion in 2021 alone. That would consume 20% of all tax revenues. When we then add the cost of mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, 95% of all tax receipts would be spent before Congress can begin to fund national defense or any other essential function of government. This is simply unsustainable. As Richard Nixon’s Chief Economist Herbert Stein famously said: 'That which cannot continue, won't.'\"\n",

According to the Government Accountability Office, it’s a scandal of epic proportions. A new law, attached to the last debt limit increase by Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK), mandated that the GAO begin analyzing federal programs for duplication and waste. On March 1 of this year the GAO published its first annual “Report on Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication,” which covered slightly more than one third of all federal spending. The auditors uncovered significant duplication in 33 areas, including: Twenty agencies operating 56 programs dedicated to financial literacy. GAO and agencies can’t even estimatewhat they cost. Highways programs have not been rebooted since 1956. The Department of Transportation (DOT) spends $58 billion on 100 separate programs run by five DOT agencies with 6,000 employees. GAO says the programs have 'not evolved to reflect current priorities in transportation planning.' In 2007, the U.S. Agriculture Department paid $1.1 billion in farm subsidies to 170,000 dead people. Fifteen federal agencies now oversee 30 food laws, and at least four departments compete to administer 80 economic development programs.\"\n",

Insurance works because not everyone will fall sick at the same time, so it is possible to make payments to those who do fall sick even though their care costs more than their premium, by tapping the pooled insurance premiums. Thus, the system is undermined by the uninsured, both healthy and unhealthy.  when healthy individuals choose to go uninsured, the model breaks down as well, because they are limiting the pool of reserves available for those who are sick. If they wait until they are sick to get insurance, they defeat the purpose of insurance, too.

As a consequence, resources have been devoted to such avoidance at a direct cost to effective care management. National health care costs continue to grow at rates well above inflation, but there has been precious little incentive for the private sector to devote its innovative energies to controlling them.

In the end, under the January 2009 offer, Palestinians would have received an area equal to 98 to 98.5 percent of the West Bank (depending on which press report you read), while 10 years ago they were offered 97 percent.

Only after Arafat began his terror war, and Israelis driving through Arab towns found themselves in mortal danger, did Israel build the 'Israelis only' (not 'Jews only') roads.

Based on how they scored, teachers then wound up in one of five salary categories, with \"novices\" making the least money and 'accomplished' teachers the most.  The pilot proved successful.

Out-of-wedlock childbearing, in most cases, occurs because young adult men and women are unable to develop committed, loving marital relationships.

Deprived of blood, the meatus may contract and scarify, obstructing the flow of urine.35 This condition, known as meatal stenosis, often requires corrective surgery.

      "- \"II. HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE POLICY OF TARGETED KILLING? There is no question that Israel's policy of targeted killing has hurt the capability of its Arab adversaries to prosecute attacks against Israel. Terrorism is essentially an offensive action, making counter-offensive actions such as targeted killing an especially effective response. It is exceedingly difficult for Israel to defend itself from terror attacks or to deter terror attacks by Palestinians. In terms of defense, there are literally tens of thousands of targets in Israel for Palestinian terrorists. Power stations, government bureaus, bus depots, airports, skyscrapers, open-air markets and sport stadiums—the list is endless. It is impossible to defend them all, especially against a determined adversary that can choose the time and place of attack. Although, as discussed below, some level of deterrence of terrorism is achievable, dissuading potential terrorists is not easy when they are eager to die for their cause. In such situations, the best response to terrorism is to go on a counter-offensive, that is, to eliminate the terrorist threat before it can be launched. One of the most successful means of eliminating terrorists before they can strike is the policy of targeted killing. As alluded to above, Israel has achieved some notable triumphs from its policy of targeted killing. In the 1950s, terrorist infiltration from Egypt lessened as a result of the killing of Egyptian intelligence officers in charge of the operation. In the 1960s, Nasser's plan to build ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel collapsed when his German scientists fled in the wake of Israeli mail bomb attacks. Black September was all but destroyed as a functioning terrorist organization in the 1970s, following the Israeli campaign to avenge the Munich massacre. The 1995 Israeli assassination of Islamic Jihad leader Shikaki in Malta undermined the effectiveness of this group for several years, as successors struggled over policy and power\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"from its heightened practice during the second intifada. First, targeted killings have impeded the effectiveness of Palestinian terrorist organizations where leadership, planning, and tactical skills are confined to a few key individuals. There are a limited number of people who have the technical ability to make bombs and plan attacks. If these people are eliminated, the ability to mount attacks is degraded. There is some evidence that targeted killings have reduced the performance of Palestinian operations. The large number of intercepted suicide bombers (Israelis estimate they stop over 80 percent of attempts) and poorly planned attacks (e.g. suicide bombers who appear with wires sticking out of their bag or detonations that occur with little loss of life) indicates that there are problems either with the organization of the operations or those available to carry them out. There are individual leaders whose charisma and organizational skills keep a group together. If they are eliminated, they are not easily replaced. Shikaki of the Islamic Jihad falls into this category.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Law and Targeted Killing The policy of targeted killing is fully consistent with Jewish and Israeli law, and is in accordance with most interpretations of international law as well. Regarding Jewish law, the \"Rodef\" injunction that appears in the Bible (Exodus 22:1) makes it abundantly clear that if someone is coming to kill you, you are obligated to kill them first. This obligation applies not only for one's protection, but for the defense of one's community as well. As such, killing a terrorist before he can act is not only permitted by Jewish law, it is required.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Although Israel has gained more sympathy abroad for its tactic since September 11, not all Israelis are entirely convinced that the method is worth pursuing. Critics of the \"selective targeting\" policy point out its self-destructive aspect. After each targeting, the Palestinians promise—and in most cases deliver—a hard and painful response. Assassination victims are automatically hailed as martyrs, and vengeful Palestinian admirers of the deceased volunteer to take his place. Following ‘Ayyash's death, Arafat publicly proclaimed him a martyr and a hero; streets in Palestinian cities were named after him; and a wave of suicide bombings resulted in fifty-nine dead and 250 wounded Israelis. Following the January 2001 assassination of the Fatah leader in Tulkarem, Ra'd Karmi, the Tanzim and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for attacks that took the lives of fifty-seven Israelis. Hizbullah is also a vindictive organization. ‘Abbas Musawi's killing was soon followed by the bombing of the Israeli embassy in Argentina. The price was heavy: twenty-nine killed and 242 wounded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Insofar as Israel erodes the norm of assassination, it transforms the rules of conflict in a manner that benefits its most fervent adversaries. It is of course true that norms do not determine behavior. Terrorists, almost by definition, are not constrained by established norms. The long history of plane hijackings and other murderous attacks against innocent civilians by terrorists throughout the world gives brutal testimony to their willingness to violate established codes of conduct. In confronting this challenge, states have also had to depart from usual norms. Terrorists typically do not appear in identifiable uniforms or hold clear swaths of territory, making conventional responses to their threats all but impossible. Insofar as Israel (and other states) make war on terror, traditional norms of combat will have to be eroded no matter what the long-term implications may be. Nevertheless, when a major regional power and democracy such as Israel openly proclaims its right to pursue a policy of targeted killing, it helps to create a new standard of behavior that may work to its and other states detriment. Norms may not be determinative, but neither are they irrelevant. Rather than simply disregarding norms because they interfere with its war on terror, Israel needs to act in a way that preserves its right of self-defense without bringing about future harm to itself and to the international community.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Targeted killing is popular with the Israeli public. A poll published by Ma'ariv in July 2001 found that 90 percent of the Israeli public supported the policy. There appears to be a near-universal belief that targeted killing represents an appropriate response to the terror attacks that afflict the population. No other Israeli policy, including incursions into Palestinian territory, arrests of militants, the erection of a wall, or forced transfer of Palestinians from the territories to neighboring Arab countries enjoys the support received by targeted killing.\"\n",

Because creationism attempts to advance an unalterable hypothesis or doctrine, it does not follow the basic principles of science, which stem from doubt, hypothesizing, and re-hypothesizing on to accepted theory. Because creationism fails to follow this basic scientific, theoretical approach, logically it is argued that it should not be called a \"science\".\n",

As Christian writer C.S. Lewis observes, 'deterrence in itself, would be a very wicked thing to do. On the classical theory of punishment it was of course justified on the ground that the man deserved it. Why, in Heaven's name, am I to be sacrificed to the good of society in this way?-unless, of course, I deserve it.' Inflicting a penalty merely to deter -- rather than to punish for deeds done -- is the very definition of cruelty. A purely deterrent penalty is one where a man is punished -- not for something that he did -- but for something someone else might do. Lewis explained the logical end of this argument: 'If deterrence is all that matters, the execution of an innocent man, provided the public think him guilty, would be fully justified.'\" Men should be punished for their own crimes and not merely to deter others.

Catholic teaching on the death penalty is clearly articulated in the encyclical The Gospel of Life, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church. In Catholic teaching the state has the recourse to impose the death penalty upon criminals convicted of heinous crimes if this ultimate sanction is the only available means to protect society from a grave threat to human life. However, this right should not be exercised when other ways are available to punish criminals and to protect society that are more respectful of human life (ie. life without parole).\n",

Christ also rose to new life for the sake of all. His suffering, death, and resurrection brought a new dimension to human life, the possibility of reconciliation with God through repentance. This gift is offered to all without exception, and human life was given new dignity and sacredness through it. The death penalty, however, denies Christ's power to transform and restore all human beings. In the New Testament, when a woman having committed a crime was brought before Jesus, He persisted in questioning her accusers, so that they walked away (John 8:1-11).\"\n",

Although most drugs are manufactured outside the body, gene therapy takes a different approach: a gene is delivered into the affected cells in the body, where it produces a protein that acts as a therapeutic agent. The potential success depends not only on the gene's delivery into the appropriate cells, but also on the gene's ability to function properly. Both requirements pose considerable technical challenges. Noninfectious viruses are used to deliver the gene, just like ordinary viruses infect cells. Unfortunately, this method is imprecise and also limited to the specific types of cells the virus can infect. If the proteins aren't produced efficiently or the transformed cells eventually die of old age, then repeated rounds of therapy are needed. Gene therapy can be improved by using stem cells. Because stem cells self-renew, they can reduce the need for repeated rounds of therapy. Blood-forming stem cells are especially good choices for delivering drugs because they are easily removed from -- and reintroduced into -- the body, and once in the body they home in on certain organs and structures such as marrow, spleen, and thymus. Dozens of human clinical trials have used HSCs to deliver therapeutic agents such as interferon to patients suffering from blood and solid-tumor cancers (as opposed to cancers of the blood), anemias, and immune diseases such as SCID and HIV. In some cases the results have been promising, extending the lives of terminally ill patients.

Four days after fertilization, while still in a laboratory dish, an eight-cell embryo is grasped gently by light suction and a single cell is removed with a pipette. The embryo recovers with a quick round of cell division. The DNA in the cell is extracted and then tested with a genetic probe for the disease in question. The test ascertains whether the embryo has no disease genes, is a 'carrier' with one disease gene and one normal gene, or has both copies of the gene and will therefore develop the disease. Only embryos with no disease genes are chosen for implantation. Parents who carry the gene, or who have family histories of the disease, can use PGD to avoid having an affected child...PGD has emerged as a tool for parents whose only other option would be to test abnormalities during fetal development.

But an international criminal court will be nothing like Nuremberg.\"4 Consider how the Nuremberg trials actually worked. They followed the unconditional military and political surrender of the Axis powers. Prospective defendants were already in custody, and extensive documentary and physical evidence was readily available.

Continental European constitutional structures do not, by and large, reflect a similar set of beliefs. They do not so thoroughly separate judicial from executive powers, just as their parliamentary systems do not so thoroughly separate executive from legislative powers.

Drawing on recent research on human happiness, this Article argues that while wealthy nations are generally happier than their poorer counterparts, neither national nor individual economic growth appear to have an appreciable impact on the subjective well-being of the citizens of relatively wealthy nations. Significant causes of this finding include the problem of rivalry—that increases in the income of some depress the happiness of others—and the fact that individuals overestimate the degree to which additional consumption will improve their happiness. Studies show the level of inequality in a society also may affect levels of happiness. Ultimately, happiness research is consistent with the strongest justification for adopting a progressive tax structure—income has declining marginal utility thus redistribution can increase total welfare in a society.\"\n",

However the world is moving towards population balance or indeed reduction by 2050, so such vast upheavals would only ‘solve’ the ageing problem for one generation.

The measure states that, in the event that the Security Council cannot maintain international peace, a matter can be taken up by the General Assembly. This procedure has been used 10 times so far, most notably in 1956 to help resolve the Suez Canal crisis.

By extension, it can be argued that water is essential to all of the rights that depend on health and life, such as the right to free speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of religion. This all makes water an exceptional, fundamental part of protecting our rights as individuals. In this way, water can actually be seen as a \"negative\" right as it protects the violation of our other rights (a counter-argument to the notion that water could only be a \"positive\" right offered as a premium to citizens). The problem is that companies are not fundamentally able to secure this right, without exception.

This does not mean that companies are evil, but simply that they are profit-maximizing entities that do not have a fundamental interest in ensuring a citizen's right and access to water. Companies have an interest in charging as much as consumers are willing to pay for water. It is common that private companies increase rates dramatically (sometimes as much as two to three times over) in their profit interests. Many can't afford the fees that this entails, and are forced to move, a violation of the right to water. The fundamental problem is that the profit interests of private water utilities lead directly away from the consistent, equatable, affordable protection of the right to water.

Conversely, there is not profit interest at the managerial level in government-owned companies. If the government-owned company performs highly efficiently or somewhat efficiently, it matters less to managers of these companies because it does not typically affect them monetarily.

For example, marriage between classes, between whites and non-whites, and even between, for instance, the British, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh, were problematic issues long before immigration. Colonial attitudes were highly unsupportive of marriages between the ruling white class and the darker-skinned colonized people.

Arranged marriages are pretty public, they often involve religious and cultural ceremonies, a great deal of expense (families travelling abroad), and an include an entire network of people; more importantly, in many cultures where arranged marriage is common, the dissolution of a marriage is a shameful situation for the individuals involved, especially if the dissolution stems from something as superficial as trying to get an entry Visa.\n",

When the Israelis informed the Palestinian Authority who they were after, this information was often passed to the targeted individuals so that they knew they were being hunted. Some voluntarily chose to place themselves in Palestinian custody to avoid being slain. The threat they posed to Israel was consequently diminished. There are numerous accounts of others on the \"hit\" list taking precautions against being killed such as sleeping in a different location every night and not letting others know of their whereabouts.19 Even for those Palestinians who have not been told they are being hunted, the very possibility they might be targeted is likely to cause a change in behavior. Time and effort undertaken to avoid Israeli dragnets are time and effort not undertaken to plan or carry out operations against Israel.\"\n",

      ".  - \"Targeted killing also acts as a deterrent. In one sense, it appears virtually impossible to deter people willing and even eager to lose their life. But behind every suicide bomber are others who might not be as ready for martyrdom. The large number of Palestinian commanders who surrendered meekly to Israeli forces during the large-scale military incursions in the spring of 2002 lends support to the notion that many senior officials do not wish to die for their cause. It is also reasonable to assume that there are skilled, capable Palestinians who do not engage in terrorist operations for fear of Israeli reprisals. Most important, there is strong evidence that the policy of targeted killing hurts Palestinian organizations to the extent to which they are willing to alter their behavior. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon met with three Palestinian leaders (though not Yasir Arafat) on January 30, 2002. When Sharon asked the Palestinians what they wanted from him, first on their list was an end to targeted killings.20 Islamic Jihad and Hamas agreed to refrain from launching attacks in pre-1967 Israel in December 2001 so long as Israel refrained from killing its leaders. Although the cease-fire eventually broke down, their willingness to abide by the cease-fire, even temporarily, indicates the deterrent power of targeted killing.\"\n",

      ".  - \"many Israelis dismiss the argument that the killing feeds a vicious cycle of death and violence that might not be to Israel's benefit. They believe there is no causality between Israel's actions and the Palestinians' decision to embrace terror. \"Islamic Jihad and others do not need excuses to carry out attacks,\" said Israel's former deputy defense minister Ephraim Sneh, \"since in any case they are constantly trying to harm Israelis.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      ".  - \"What is less obvious to the critics is the number of attacks that have been thwarted through the masterminds' removal. \"Ticking bomb,\" a well-known term in counterterrorism jargon, refers to a terrorist or a group of terrorists in the process of launching an attack. Killing the perpetrator or his dispatcher stops the clock. The Karmi assassination was undertaken to prevent him from carrying out his plans, which included the assassination of a prominent Israeli. ‘Umar Sa‘adah, the head of the Hamas military wing in Bethlehem, killed in July 2001, was planning a major attack at the closing ceremony of the Maccabiah Games, the Jewish olympics.  At the time of his assassination, Salah Shihada was in the process of organizing a \"mega-attack\" of six terror operations that were to take place simultaneously. Nobody will ever know the scope of the bloodbath that was prevented by thwarting these attempts. These acts never made headlines; they constitute the silent terror—the terror that never happened. Fighting terror is like fighting car accidents: one can count the casualties but not those whose lives were spared by prevention. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Israelis go about their lives without knowing that they are unhurt because their murderers met their fate before they got the chance to carry out their diabolical missions. This silent multitude is the testament to the policy's success.\"\n",
      "\n",
      ".  - \"Inasmuch as becoming a victim of an Israeli targeted killing has become a badge of honor among Palestinians, when the Israelis slay an alleged terrorist they unwittingly enhance the popularity of the organization to which he or she belonged. Many of the targets of Israel's attacks have come from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. These organizations then exploit their casualties in a manner designed to curry support among the Palestinian people. With public opinion polls showing skyrocketing approval of these groups, their efforts appear to be succeeding. In an effort to compete with Hamas and Jihad's success, Arafat's organizations dramatically stepped up their own terrorist attacks in 2002. A competition developed as to which group could launch the most costly attacks against Israel. The policy of targeted killing, by affording prestige to those planning and committing these attacks, has encouraged that which it most seeks to deter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      ".  - \"The Limited Effectiveness of Targeted Killing There are also strong arguments that targeted killing is an ineffective and even harmful policy for Israel to follow. No compelling evidence exists that targeted killing has reduced the terrorist threat against Israel. By May 2002, after eighteen months of targeted killings carried out at an unprecedented scale, the number of Israeli victims of Palestinian terror had reached an all-time high of nearly 500. It is, of course, always possible to assert that the number of Israeli deaths would have been even greater if not for the targeted killing. But this is an unfalsifiable proposition that is based more on faith than on reasoned analysis. It is not difficult to understand why targeted killing has not been effective in stopping terrorism. Political entities promoting terror against Israel such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Palestinian Authority are very decentralized. They are made up of many cells, the destruction of some having little or no impact on others. Moreover, the number of young men (and women) who are willing and eager to be suicide bombers appears to be virtually limitless. Outfitting these martyr wannabes with primitive bombs capable of wreaking murderous assaults appears to be relatively easy—at least within the capability of many Palestinians who the Israelis have not yet killed. No greater evidence of the failure of Israeli policy exists than the dramatic escalation of terrorist attacks and Israeli casualties in the first half of 2002, after more than a year of targeted killings.\"\n",

      "\n",
      ".  - \"The policy of targeted killing also hurts Israel's security by damaging the effectiveness of its intelligence organizations. By diverting scarce resources away from the collection and analysis of intelligence on the threat posed by adversarial states, Israel runs the risk of paying less attention to existential threats in order to combat critical but less than vital challenges to its security. Following the Munich Olympics massacre, Israel focused much of the attention of its intelligence services on tracking down and killing the perpetrators. This effort may have led, in part, to diverting Israel's attention away from the growing threat posed by Egypt and Syria, which led to Israel being caught by surprise at the outbreak of the October 1973 War.25 Even where the effect is not so dramatic, targeted killing can hurt Israel's ability to gather critical intelligence. Locating and killing key Palestinian terrorists requires timely intelligence, much of which can only be supplied by informers. Given that a limited number of people will know the whereabouts of the targets, it will not be difficult to isolate those who have collaborated with Israel. Increasing reports of informers being killed during the second intifada, with their bodies publicly displayed, may partly be a result of their identities becoming known as a result of the targeted killing policy.\"\n",

On this basis it would be better to capture him and put him on trial. Then if he was handed a life sentence, it would humiliate him by denying him the ultimate penalty.

      " - \"Gene therapy is a relatively recent and highly experimental approach to treating disease. Although most drugs are manufactured outside the body, gene therapy takes a different approach: a gene is delivered into the affected cells in the body, where it produces a protein that acts as a therapeutic agent. The potential success depends not only on the gene's delivery into the appropriate cells, but also on the gene's ability to function properly. Both requirements pose considerable technical challenges. Noninfectious viruses are used to deliver the gene, just like ordinary viruses infect cells. Unfortunately, this method is imprecise and also limited to the specific types of cells the virus can infect. If the proteins aren't produced efficiently or the transformed cells eventually die of old age, then repeated rounds of therapy are needed. Gene therapy can be improved by using stem cells. Because stem cells self-renew, they can reduce the need for repeated rounds of therapy. Blood-forming stem cells are especially good choices for delivering drugs because they are easily removed from -- and reintroduced into -- the body, and once in the body they home in on certain organs and structures such as marrow, spleen, and thymus. Dozens of human clinical trials have used HSCs to deliver therapeutic agents such as interferon to patients suffering from blood and solid-tumor cancers (as opposed to cancers of the blood), anemias, and immune diseases such as SCID and HIV. In some cases the results have been promising, extending the lives of terminally ill patients.

The embryo recovers with a quick round of cell division. The DNA in the cell is extracted and then tested with a genetic probe for the disease in question. The test ascertains whether the embryo has no disease genes, is a 'carrier' with one disease gene and one normal gene, or has both copies of the gene and will therefore develop the disease. Only embryos with no disease genes are chosen for implantation. Parents who carry the gene, or who have family histories of the disease, can use PGD to avoid having an affected child...PGD has emerged as a tool for parents whose only other option would be to test abnormalities during fetal development.

The report underscores the vulnerability of the Iranian economy--especially the oil sector--to sanctions. At first glance, it might seem that a country with the second-largest gas and oil reserves in the world has nothing to worry about.

Member States consistently rejected all these formulae, arguing that the legal and institutional framework did not cater for any halfway-houses between membership and association. Things have changed little since then: a privileged relationship can only be a prelude to a more intense relationship subject to compliance with Articles I-2 and I-58 of the European Constitution, and in no way a relationship reached as a result of a veto based on essentialist arguments of a cultural or religious nature.\n",

The main premises here is that \"rights\" should only protect individuals from harm from others and allow them certain freedoms, but a right to universal health care entails individuals burdening other members of society (possibly violating the liberties of innocents) for things that are perceived as needed or desirable. The extreme of this argument is the circumstance in which a careless smoker is given the \"right\" to burden others for their expensive health care costs.\n",

Then that country can drive all the businesses that do the same thing, in other countries, out of business. This might sound like it is good, but then the other countries respond. An economic war can be almost as bad as a real war. What countries need is stability. Any subsidy of a private business distorts the market and makes it less efficient.

Figure 1(b) shows that if a consumer is charged a price P1, which is different from the marginal cost of supply, then the consumer will not consume X* but X1.

As a result, the elected official does not raise the funds through taxes and avoids solving the problem. This is simply an illustration of instances in which public officials take into account considerations that are not in the public interest and prevent proper funding of the water infrastructure. Private investments in the water infrastructure are a very appropriate means to raise funds to solve problems like this, particularly when public officials will not act in the public interest.\n",
