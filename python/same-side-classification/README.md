We are also interested in the stance classification of the statements. For example, the statement could support (for), object (against), or take no stance towards a specific topic. Another variation of this problem is to classify if 2 statements are in the same side or different side.

Each of us have different approaches into this problem, which are as follows:
- *[Stance Classification](https://git.webis.de/webisstud/wstud-visit-the-dome-ss19/tree/master/python/same-side-classification/stance-prediction)*
- *[Mixed Supervised Learning](https://git.webis.de/webisstud/wstud-visit-the-dome-ss19/tree/master/python/same-side-classification/mixed-supervised-learning)*
- *[Explicit Semantic Analysis](https://git.webis.de/webisstud/wstud-visit-the-dome-ss19/tree/master/notebooks/same-side-classification-esa.ipynb)*
- *[Hierarchical  Attention Network](https://git.webis.de/webisstud/wstud-visit-the-dome-ss19/tree/master/python/same-side-classification/hierachical-attention-network)*

The results are discussed in this [presentation](https://git.webis.de/webisstud/wstud-visit-the-dome-ss19/tree/master/presentations/2019-10-18).
