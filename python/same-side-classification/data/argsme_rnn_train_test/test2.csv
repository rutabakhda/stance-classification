1293,so a sperm being killed is not condidered wrong as the life does not have any worth ,0
1294,the only distinguishing point you make is how advanced the two year old is compared to the unborn baby . as it sits now he has no reason aside from the arbitrary location of hte baby to say it is not developed enough yet when had it been born instead of terminated by law it would have been advanced enough . if con had used the mothers autonomy at least he would have made an arguable distinction ,0
1295,an hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down but it is not this day . by all that you hold dear on this good earth i bid you stand men of the west . a day may come when the courage of men fails when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship but it is not this day ,0
1298,you think it is morally reprehensible that a person should only live if they are brought up in circumstances that you decide and not them . so in order to prove your case you must either give an absolute standard or you must give me a convincing explanation of why abortion should be allowed . the embryo is not aware of itself yet no bonds have been formed and the child could not survive outside the womb . there is a substantial chance that the child will grow up in a poor environment . the government is not responsible or trustworthy enough to make decisions like this on an individuals behalf .  plus you are assuming that no bonds have been formed .  secondly you are right there may be justification of death . in this case no one can prove anything is wrong or immoral because it is relative . there is an obvious physical bond formed . it was our government that stated the judiciary at this point in the development of mans knowledge is not in a position to . there are more than enough authoritative public resources to prove human life begins at fertilization human development begins at fertilization the process during which a male gamete or sperm spermatozoo developmentn unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to form a single cell called a zygote ,0
1299, the nonaggression principle the conclusion from  and  is that we may not violate the property rights of other people if we hold discourse to be a rational means of normative inquiry . if you and i cannot use the same object it is necessary to fairly determine who shall have priority . there is not and could not be an agreement implicit or otherwise that he may remain on the truck . we ourselves are therefore no longer operating within the bounds of rational discourse and our victim is justified in taking action against us to defend his rights . it is especially noteworthy that without the assumption of initial freedom debating norms becomes absurd . if i agreed to work for you for a year for free and then change my mind the most you can do is demand material property as compensation you cannot enslave me without aggressing against my rights . this argument is used to justify property in the traditional sense of material possessions as well but for the purpose of the debate i will include only the argument for ownership of one s body .  this point can be confusing because there is no direct action taken to violate the mother s rights . hoppe makes this argument but it is considered most significant by roger pilon who argues that we cannot deny the premises that we presuppose merely by acting . if a person does not consent to our use of his body and we proceed to use him anyway we are violating his rights and the nap . if a were unable to communicate with b he could still justifiably remove a from his property using the minimal necessary force . through our rejection of the principle of nonviolence we have lost our claim to negative rights . the existence of such a right would automatically violate the negative right of self ownership of someone else through binding him to act in a certain way and would therefore be unacceptable ,1
1300,you should be a nice person to other people if you are supporting people to kill someone inside of you you are a monster ,0
1301,if abortion were to be legal just under life threatening circumstances which is your case then it would be the law saving her life . sexual assault the forcible perpetration of an act of sexual contact on the body of another person male or female without his or her consent . low birth weight babies are more likely to have organs that are not fully developed which can result in complications such as bleeding in the brain respiratory distress syndrome and intestinal problems . according to the american medical association babies born to women who do not have regular prenatal care are  times more likely to die before the age of  year .  my first point discusses some ideas on when life begins but the heart starts to beat  days from conception and by  days the heart is pumping blood through a closed circulatory system . nutrition they have a higher rate of poor eating habits than older women and are less likely to take recommended daily vitamins to maintain adequate nutrition during pregnancy . what I am saying is not that science has proved when life begins but it has proved some basic guidelines for an idea of it . adolescent mothers are about  years behind in their age group for completing their education . assault  adolescent pregnancies have many risk factors for their babies . gastrulation commences at the beginning of the third week of pregnancy when the zygote now known as an embryo is implanted into the uterus of the mother . it is from this point and onward during development that the fetus is capable of the type of mental activity associated with humanity ,1
1302,yet the american psychological association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion and that there was no evidence of post abortion syndrome . adoption is not an alternative to abortion because it remains the womans choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption .  risk of serious complications and do not affect a womans health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth . in the case of rape or incest forcing a woman made pregnant by this violent act would because further psychological harm to the victim . human life occurs at conception but fertilized eggs used for in vitro fertilization are also human lives and those not implanted are routinely thrown away . as it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord its health is dependent on her health and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb . often a woman is too afraid to speak up or is unaware she is pregnant thus the morning after pill is ineffective in these situations ,1
1303,the reason that i believe that a child is human at the first stage of its life because it was created by human reproduction the embryo contains human dna the second the egg is fertilized and because it has the potential to become a fully grown human being ,0
1304,another round gone vote for the one still participating please ladies and gentlemen ,1
1305,the first round if for accepting the challenge the next two rounds will be for providing your own arguments supporting them and refuting the other arguments ,1
1306,reality is that less than  of all abortions are enacted because of these reasons the  is simply for the sake of convenience or desire .  it sounds like value and what that includes determines the weight on the scales of a mothers desires vs . when does a newborn or a child not feel any degree of pain or pleasure and still lives . if you agree with me that feeling is the morally relevant factor for value then  weeks should be the abortion limit . can you give me this morally relevant factor and explain why animals are not included and fetuses are . because that would mean the fetus value depends on its ability to feel which is not at all a very scientific or ethical way to determine value .  an adult human life unaware of the pain or negative consequences would have value where the unfeeling fetus does not as the adult human though not being aware does have the capacity to feel pain . this reason for value necessarily puts a milestone marker on when this value starts . the fetus is either valuable or not and i think abortion becomes wrong when the fetus becomes valuable ,0
1307,its individual such as yourself that can not take any decisions on their own that needs constant validation that makes the rest of us look bad ,1
1308,that was my bad i had forgotten to post my initial position along with the description of the rounds ,0
1309,this is a tragedy and if banning abortion does not reduce the abortion rate but instead increases the rate of unsafe abortions then making it illegal is immoral clearly i am sure my opponent will agree with me on this issue . when we consider that with natural births if pregnancy is diagnosed within  days of fertilisation the probability of birth is  to  are we to say natural children are  times more valuable . however surely one can argue that while it does not have the actuality of personhood it can the potentiality of personhood and that is what is important . if abortion is wrong only because it deprives the world of a future person then abortion in this case is not wrong but merely a delay of a life and for the reason of helping many more people . the first is that abortion does not necessarily deprive the world of a rational and self conscious being . the science of ivf is a wonder that has allowed us to understand how life develops from a sperm and egg . the vast majority of abortions a procedure to end the potential life of a child come through the use of the morning after pill .  the probability of a child resulting from a given embryo is  and the probability of a child resulting from an egg that has been placed in a fluid to which sperm has been added is  we learn firstly that the potential of an ivf produced embryo is only  . of course this is severely important in public policy and still an existent issue according to charlottle byrne they just throw the baby in the bin . considering a large share of abortions are done with the reasoning I am not ready yet we ought to take into account how many are simply delaying . the first of two drugs was administered then and today dorothy will receive the second . therefore it cannot possibly be classified as a person with the rights of a person . for consider an alien species coming to earth with the same if not more developed code of society culture ethics and philosophy than us . in fact if the world is overpopulated as many would argue then abortion is no worse than other means of preventing potential people being born .  so if the embryo is a potential person why are not the egg and sperm considered jointly also a potential person ,1
1310,abortion should not be legal because its killing a real living humans people from left might say that the women should get to choose if want to abort a baby or not ,0
1311,so referring to one of my points in the last round if you killed a full grown adult in their sleep but it does not because the victim pain or any sorrow to anyone who might have been close to them it is moral . because who are we to say that animals and even plants who feel on some sort of level should not be killed for our consumption . if you believe that pain and the awareness of that pain is required in order to hand value to a being we might as well all be vegans no even more so than that not eat at all . if you were to value something material in this world it would be because you think it enhances your life or because it is an asset . the reason for the value is plain and simple but the desire to change morality comes from a place of selfish desire vs human life which really is not a new argument at all . the baby certainly has nothing to offer the world and is actually not deemed useful to the world . i doubt you would agree with that statement so if the same can not apply for adult human beings who do not have the ability to feel pain how could it apply for a developing human being who can not feel pain either ,1
1312,we can penalise them if you say no you can penalise the girls who belong to your society then force women who belong to your society to help the baby in order to survive not others .  rules which does not exist but thought to exist first there is no standart form of a rules named unalienable rights and we have not established a rule like that . and everybody is not to live according to it part is also answer to i will be arguing that the woman should not have the choice to abort a child due our unalienable right to life and the very basics of our human dignity .  the reason unalienable rights exist that rules does not exist just presumed to be existing in fact no rule like that and there are so many types of unalienable rules in the usa too according to which we have to live . that example refutes and can refute any kind of arguement against liberty on abortion that is just enough to understand and explain that abortion is the right of a human but yet i will answer him when i worte in short words i thought that he will understand seems he did not . when the standart form of rules like that gets created come and use it as an arguement at this point there is no rules or rights like that or there iis a rule like that and do not i know it .  has never existed and always believed to exist and you can not require and force somebody to your beliefs and you rpresumptious rules if you can i also can this will result with the civil war in the usa and the world do you agree with me .  in response to me arguing that innocent human life is not to be terminated do to respect for human dignity and the right to life i hav enever said that the baby needs to be killed .  as americans we have established that the right to life is an unalienable right and is to never be taken away unless the rights of the individual is taken away due to actions they have committed against the society .  you have a right to leave baby has a right to live on but the woman has also right not to destroy her life so that the baby can live on i do not understand what my opponent is saying due to atrocious grammatical mistakes .  every abortion takes the life of an unborn member of the human race let us consider him the human no matter born or not you are destroying the right of the woman not to help . according to our rules rules which does not exist but thought to exist like that every action i counted is crime then we have a right to penalise anybody who drinks alcohol has sex before marriage and e t c because our unalienable rules let us penalise such person .  even if we say that rules exist however the usa is multinational country and there are so many types of nationalities in the usa each nationality may have its own unalienable rules then it is not justice to force somebody according to your unalienable rules ,1
1313,abortion is morally wrong since it ends something that at best could have been a source of joy for those around it and possibily many other people and at worst a nuisance to society before it could even begin . this continues until the child s entire body is removed from the womb . you s supreme court justice kennedy describes the procedure saying the fetus in many cases dies just as a human adult or child would it bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb .  according to these articles latest time on which a baby can feel pain is  weeks not  and that is the latest since pain can start sooner . I am not going to advance this point further for now since you did not seem to finish your  it is fairly common sense that an unborn baby cannot survive on its own but neither can newborns very small children and very old people ,0
1314,saying that women or girls do not deserve to live is sexist ,1
1315,such acts are not safe people have the knowledge it is not safe and yet continue to do it anyway just as they would with drugs or smoking . after all only  of abortions are for the health of the mother  such a thing would negate that notion of killing unborn children to keep us in population check so to speak . I would like to think nobody gets an abortion from somebody who is doing it in secret because what they are doing is illegal . but much of her argument hinges on those that face complications of those who are pregnant we musn t forget that just like having a child or an std death is one of the adverse side effects for those who become pregnant . just like with drugs people know the consequences of having a back alley abortion . one of the main problems with outlawing abortion is the use of unsafe back alley abortions . as my opponent said herself in round  the fetus is in fact is a life ,0
1316,i think abortion must be free it must be up to the pregnant woman . you may bring an arguement which says abortion must be banned because it is injustice and e t c and i will give answer if it is wrong . it is the meaning of abortion ,1
1317,a sperm on the other hand does not have the potential to be a human at least not by itself which does not make it immoral to it ,0
1318,if rights do not objectively exist then you can not say that a woman has objective bodily rights and you could not say objectively that the rapist and the kidnapper was wrong . the huge problem with their argument is that if rights come from our own interest then that also means that the rapist and the kidnapper also get to define what rights we have . in my opening argument i established that what makes someone have the right to life is the fact that they are human . it was then stated that s body against her will a fetus carries out exactly this kind of aggression . that said it is ridiculous to say that the mother has these rights when my opponent can not even establish that these bodily rights objectively exist . otherwise there would be no rights at all and my opponent would have no argument for bodily rights . so i am curious if the examples where mothers hurt themselves due to abortion being made illegal are just as common as abortions harming the mother . while someone might save the child instead of the  embryos this would not show that the embryos were not human and vice versa . i was not saying that there was no such thing as bodily rights but unless they can back up that claim objectively then their argument falls apart . i have already made an argument for why humans have a positive right to life . this would only show that the emotions of a person impacts their decision . if there is an objective right to life then the human embryo gets that right as well . i spent my whole opening argument proving that being human makes you have the right to life . my opponent says i did make the argument that rights derive from our own interests desires but more importantly taking cons denial approach means rape kidnapping people and taking a kidney have not done something wrong since there was no bodily rights to be violated in the first place . and if they decide to deny the existence of rights altogether then their whole argument falls apart and this debate comes down to me showing that rights exist objectively ,0
1319,pro extends their argument from round one that since fetuses can not feel pain nor are they human beings it is morally justifiable to abort a fetus if said abortion will reduce pain to the mother father child or anyone else affected by the pregnancy . because of that pro should win the debate as pro points out that abortions are painless to the fetus as it can not even feel pain and abortions are usually done to prevent pain after birth . this is impossible for con to do however as all modern medical research proves fetuses are not human beings . as discussed neuroanatomical pathways necessary for processing pain similar to those observed in adults and older children could be in place by  weeks gestation . extension con makes several assumptions in their argument specifically that a fetus is a human being . the stereotypical hormonal stress response of adults or older infants of about  months onwards reporting pain is observable in fetuses at  weeks gestation . a man woman or child of the species homo sapiens distinguished from other animals by superior mental development power of articulate speech and upright stance .  which we can stop by not treating sex as a health issue but something that you should not do until you get married and you do not have to intrude on people rights but change public opinion by the way your stats agree with my last point if we promote safe sex contraceptives are very cheap and if you want to have sex take precautions . that might help to change your opinion to your point about fetuses not being human two human people had sexual intercourse to produce this child so it would be denying a science fact that this is not human offspring this is a quote from your last post on this debatewhile this is hard to understand i believe con is saying that because two humans were required to produce a fetus it is therefore human and should have all the rights of a human . pro has provided an example of how fetuses can not feel pain automatically making them less then human beings . these and other observations are taken to suggest that the fetal mind can support an experience of pain from at least  weeks gestation ,1
1320,i said the safest way to do it is do not because that truly is the safest way but i am by no way saying that a couple can not have sex if they do not want a baby when did i even remotely say that . i am in no way against a couple pleasuring each other . i was clearly on about if she got pregnant without wanting to . if you want to knock her up go ahead . this debate has sort of skewed on way ,1
1322,the us supreme court in planned parenthood v casey states that a fetus only becomes viable after  weeks and upheld a womans right to an abortion before that point . merriam webster defines the following as such hypocrisy feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not especially the false assumption of an appearance of virtue or religion murder the unlawful killing of another person the first definition seems to unhinge my opponents argument . therefore it is not inconsistent to support abortion because those who do do not see it as the killing of a person but rather a medical decision made by the woman . as far as the death penalty is concerned there are a multitude of reasons why liberals and non liberals oppose it . a black defendant on trial for murder is  more likely to be given they death penalty than a defendant of any other race and nearly  of all victims in death penalty cases are white despite the fact that whites make up only about  of all murder victims  ,1
1323,is a women or a couple is not fit to be a parent its better to abort it that give the child a life that could be tough ,1
1324,however i understand you may be referring to the maturity level of children in regards to an unfamiliar situation and that the decision might not be at their level and so the parents make the decision . this process determines if the patient has the potential to make her own decisions or not whether it is for against abortion . this issue becomes more clear once it is looked at in depth and with reason . they can decide without anyones help if they want to drink a glass of milk or laser shooting bees on fire . however if their decisions actions not respecting the daughters own decision will result in harm to their daughter ie not wanting to abort a pregnancy that may kill their daughter then the physician can take legal action against the parents and child services agencies and the court will also get involved in the decision making ,1
1325,as for the financial situations that may because one to get an abortion adoptive services are always available for these types of reasons . a baby who let us say does have a disease upon birth or has to face the burden of growing up without a mother or father is always better off than a person never even given a chance in the first place . it is still a human being that is given no such choice in the matter or life or death ,0
1326,on the other hand abortion to save mom is also a crucial issue . the number of rape is huge in america as well as europe and asia . in that case abortion may be necessary in advanced stage of cancer but if the option of abortion is taken altogether them mother will have no chance at all ,1
1327,my opponent makes no posts this round ,1
1328,one of the most important reasons abortion should be illegal beyond the fact that it terminates life is that most women have regret and life complications due to this action . these actions result in distress for not only the pregnant woman but also her family . in addition the responsibility a woman takes for deciding life or death of a baby remains unethical and mentally devastating no matter what type of upbringing she had . there are many reasons abortion should be illegal including the descriptive and disturbing stories about how aborted babies sometime scream as they come out and the looks of pain on their faces . god blesses people in unexpected ways however trusting that he is in control further supports and gives confidence to the woman who chooses life . though it is easy to envision lower class minority women filling the statistics of abortion studies show that the majority of women succeeding in this action are in the upper class population . empowering women concerning how to take care of as well conduct themselves in order to minimize incident lowers the statistics of rape thus lowering statistics of abortion . understanding that god makes no mistakes and plants the seed of a child can further influence a woman toward life even if she decides on adoption . in addition to complications after the procedure a woman runs a high risk of death during the procedure which increases based on how far along she is in the pregnancy . this controversy will remain for centuries however the fact that a potential life has ended before given a chance remains evidence enough for most people to understand why a person should never have a choice of whether a baby lives or dies . the seed that god plants should never be taken for granted or misused ,0
1329,as it is the alexander pruss argument still stands in defense of premise  of my original argument as well as the argument proposed by madeleine flannagan and I have shown that it is prima facie morally wrong to terminate a fetus based on the metaphysical claims I have proposed . first the fact is this violinist is a stranger and is unnaturally hooked up to the woman while the fetus is mothers offspring and the fetus is naturally where it is supposed to be during development . if it is universal right stemming from human nature based on the substance view of persons then the fetus is entitled to rights as well since these rights stem from what it is namely human with a human nature .  a fetus is not physically independenthow does it follow that since the fetus is not independent that therefore it is not a person entitled to rights such as the right to life .  a fetus does not qualify as a personi d like to extend the personhood argument by alexander pruss from last round as my opponent has not made any reference or refutation of it given that criteria infanticide would also be morally permissible since the baby does not exhibit number     . another issue is if we are only valuable or have rights in virtue of acquiring some property then we do not have unalienable rights . I would like to reiterate the terms I am using and the metaphysical explanation i gave last round . scott klusendorf notes the mothers child was conceived with her own flesh and blood and is where he naturally belongs at that stage in development the childs relation to the mother is indeed a proper one the syllogism my opponent presented is invalid . if the fetus is a human being being raped is not a justification to terminate the child just because it will remind the parent of a painful event assuming the fetus is a person . however on the face of it elective abortion is not morally permissible and only in an exceptional circumstance such as the one noted above is it permissible if the mothers life is at risk . furthermore I have shown why my opponents arguments and rebuttals do not successfully demonstrate that a fetus is not a person since the arguments contain multiple flaws ,0
1330,they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own . a case for unequal value  year old child vs   human embryos consider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door is a canister of   day human embryos which are perfectly viable and will remain so as long as they are immediately removed from the building and returned to cold storage . i have been trying to think how to crash the car to injure myself permanently but not die a mother of four . like wise it is argued a pregnant women can take action to be unplugged from the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with a pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep some one else alive such is yours hers bodily rights freedom . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the sufferings dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . also consider if such an abortion is viewed as murder the rapist gets convicted of rape but following after is the woman who he raped is now in court because she had such an abortion and thus gets convicted of murder . i know of no anti abortion person who says that you can not choose to disconnect as rejecting such a bodily right means everyone would live in danger of say a kidney being taken against their will if it could save some one else . but as i argue they are not equal and even pro lifers would have a hard time choosing to save   human embryos over one  year old child . consequences of abortion being made illegalmaking abortion illegal does not stop them woman who have illegal abortions are at much greater risk of injury and death . for example we do not consider it an unjust burden to demand enforce that people do not poison the water supply but we would consider it an unjust burden to force people to give up a kidney even if it would save the life of a self aware intelligent suffering human . now consider the burden being argued to be imposed on a pregnant woman from the moment of conception that being she should be forced to continue the pregnancy even against her will incur the pain suffering of said pregnancy and be subject to the risks of complication that can occur in a pregnancy complications that can result in serious injury even death for the pregnant woman ,1
1331,if the mother is an american citizen so is her baby and in this country all people are considered equal ,0
1332,there are many theories published though out the years stating a wide range of populations that the world would be able to sustane from one million people to one trillion ,1
1333,as this round is primarily for acceptance I will quickly introduce some brief definitions and then allow pro to make his opening case . it is great to debate a fellow brit especially such a well established member on such an important topic . abbreviationspc pro choicepl pro lifeto avoid equivocation over stages of development in pregnancy I will also use the term as an all encompassing label ,0
1334,i do not see it as the child being punished and really when the pregnancy is really early on you can not even call it human yet because it is just a ball of cells ,1
1335,this is why and i just realized it is dangerous to use and on the debate topic since it gives people more angles of attack . as i hope you see however we can not really do anything about them . however i would like to make a vain attempt at convincing you that abortion should be legal from a biblical standpoint even if the existence of god has not yet been proven . if you convince me that god exists i will happily take this assertion for granted . thus can not abortion up to the  day be reconciled with your religious beliefs . you can see that a pro life website at confirms this . the argument does not depend on the  century itself i merely tried to use it as analogous to that with no alternatives in order to explain my point ,1
1336,in cases of abortion this will be the government ,0
1337,state argument claim  ,1
1338,considering my opponent was unable to make the third round we will consider this round to not count one way or another toward the winner of this debate ,1
1340,yea i understand if your raped you can not really help getting pregnant or not an you do not want to have a rapists child but no one ever said you had to keep the baby . if your going to have sex wear a condom or go on birth control or give the baby up for adoption . you have options you do not have to kill a a baby yes its the mothers choice but the mother also has hundreds of other options and abortion should not be one of them ,0
1341,surely abortion is an instance of killing a direct and decisive violation of the right as the mother is choosing to terminate the life . the obligation to sacrifice something to save another person is certainly contentious but that does not apply to this argument . certainly have the right to self ownership is preconditioned on being alive ,0
1342,so you agree that in the case when abortion can save moms life it should be allowed . you have a boyfriend and out of passion on someday you two made out . let us suppose that you are a girl like any other fun loving girl . you and your lover have no source of income . worse none of your family does not accept this relationship ,1
1343,i guess that is the debate over then ,0
1344,their are times when the fetus is in the wrong tube and she can experience a misscarriage . most of us disregard that not everyone in life is perfect and daily we may do certain things that are not morally acceptable . everyday we experience situations where we have to decide whether or not to act moral ,1
1345,the one reason i give not debated by pro is that they ought not be treated as persons so we can exterminate them for population control . pro has argued with absolutely no evidence for his claims . i have proven through the historical examples of hitlers nazi regime and the case of rwandan genocide that human rights is not the result of social structures from . this is a debate and you cannot dispute fact with your personal feelings . i gave a reason whether good or not why babies should not be treated as a person . babies ought to be not treated as persons because they are not persons and do not have human rights . you may feel that it not worthy to argue but as a debater you must engage in debate because it is my argument which you fail to counter .  the babes in question ought not be treated as persons i say this is false . since i proved that human rights does not result from social structures in the con should win this argument .  absolutely i never claimed that they did have to contradiction you said . again social structures are in place but that did not stop mass extermination ,1
1346,when a society is no longer willing to protect the life of the most vulnerable of its members namely its unborn children then that society has certainly fallen to the lowest reaches of depravity . even the most liberal and most pro abortion politicians and people in our country would i think be horrified if it were suggested that the killing of  year old children should be legalized . but i do argue that no matter how the child was conceived that its life is still just as valuable and therefore deserving of our protection . in the third criteria the ability to reproduce i would explain that cell reproduction is a common way for an organism to meet this requirement . if the fetus is alive then regardless of all other circumstances abortion is wrong . many adult humans for instance are infertile or in some other way lack the ability of sexual reproduction . i do not argue that in the condition of rape that the rapist is any less to blame for his terrible crime . i do not know whether or not there is a way for third parties to make comments on this debate before it is finished but seeing as the onus is on me to write a response to the pro speaker i will go ahead and address the question made . on the wayne state college website there is a very clear cut explanation of these criteria and of how a fertilized egg would measure up against them ,0
1347,and even after that point a woman should be allowed to decide for herself what she wants to do with her body that is not something anyone can make for her . women should be allowed to receive an abortion before that time since there is not any fully formed human that can live on it is own . a lot of the disagreements that occur between both sides in this matter stem from one question when should the fetus be considered a child ,1
1348,if our government wanted to protect life then it should ban the use of automobiles . choice  argue that good national policy should only take into consideration the sanctity of human life oh and i am sooooo ready for this choice  even though it is a bad policy we should implement it anyway to make religious people happy which in my opinion would be a fantastic and creative rebuttal albeit a difficult course to navigate choice  forfeit the next however many rounds . and third women will not have to undergo the unbearably painful experience of child birth until they are ready . so what tens of thousands of people die in automobile crashes . but if i told everyone we should ban automobiles to preserve the lives of innocent pedestrians you would call me insane ,1
1349,finally christians believe that god created man in his own image and made us king of the animals let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth . if god gave life they believe that the person to whom he gave life has a purpose to serve god in any way that they can and so by ending that life which begins at conception for many removes this persons ability to fulfil gods wishes . as such abortion is taking away the uniqueness that god bestowed upon us as the human race if we can throw the life of a human as quickly as we can the life of an animal then we have not met this role that god set upon us and have dishonoured his wishes and gifts ,0
1350,i feel like abortion is the most horrific way to hurt a child ,1
1351,if the government does not allow her to have an abortion than that would mean that once a woman gets pregnant she has to have a child . if the government does not allow a woman to have an abortion then they are forcing her to have a child . if a woman becomes pregnant and decides that she does not want to have children than why should the government force her to have it ,1
1352,this would suggest that a being only is subject to bodily sovereignty if it is sentient only reinforcing my point that it is sentience that is the determining fctor in the morality of abortion . a more accurate example would be if the man willingly gave his kidney to the dying man and then one day changed his mind and killed the previously dying man to get his kidney back . the fetus did not choose to be born out of it is own free will so you can not argue that the fetus as a sentient creature must observe bodily sovereignty of it is mother as it has no choice but to be in it is mothers womb ,1
1353,i believe abortion is wrong therefore i do not think it should be aloud ,0
1354,as per this model i will argue that the united states government should not construct an abortion clinic in cities where there are none and that abortion clinics should be legalized and should have any and all regulations be significantly reduced if not wholly removed in order to allow for the market to create its own abortion clinics as a result of supply and demand fostered and improved by the competition between abortion clinics that would exist in a free market . the reason why there are so few abortion clinics in the united states is because of prohibitive government regulations and sticky legal concerns plus the high risk of starting an abortion clinic considering that the laws for abortion clinics and their legality is so unstable at this time . in communist east germany the trabant was a vehicle which was built under east germanys strict regulations and controls and is known as a very poorly made vehicle for many years . due to its outdated and inefficient two stroke engine which produced poor fuel economy for its low power output and thick smoky exhaust and production shortages the trabant was regarded with derisive affection as a symbol of the extinct former east germany and of the fall of the eastern bloc . even one dollar even spare change can make a world of a difference if you are trying to feed yourself with a job that pays  an hour or in some states even less than that . b furthermore forcing people to pay for something which is so polarized over its controversial status is wrong many people believe that abortion is tantamount to murder of a child . abortion clinics would be improved where legalized and significantly deregulated pro states that the government should be the one to make abortion clinics in cities where there are none in other words advocating for government controlled abortion clinics in the united states . imagine forcing people who is families were ruined by heroin addiction to pay for safe injection sites for heroin addicts . there are various examples of government control of a commodity resulting in that commoditys loss of quality . thusly not only would the quality of abortion clinics be badly hindered by government control but taxpayers will be paying for these horrible quality abortion clinics whether whether they have the money or not and whether they like it or not . although keynesian economics falls short in its advocacy for government intervention it is one good observation is this aggregate demand of a good will increase the economic output of that good ,0
1355,florynce r kennedy  ,1
1356,i have gotten quite sick and i have do not have the physical nor mental strength to post anything debate worthy ,0
1357,you have to let anyone use this service before the first  weeks or else raped women will have nowhere to have an abortion because abortion clinics will all go out of business .  science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks . he cannot win this debate because it would be tremendously unfair for him to rebut the following points or bring up new ones without me ever getting to see his point of view to rebut it . however these are only a small number of women at abortion clinics . the points conceded are science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks . for example in the future I am afraid that if a woman has a baby with blue eyes instead of i do not know green eyes she will just give up her and try again and again . I have responded to all his arguments .  abortion laws are unconstitutional because they limit freedom and take lives of unhealthy women .  abortion laws are unconstitutional because they limit freedom and take lives of unhealthy women . opponent you can always give the constitutional blah blah limiting of freedoms crap speech but that does not make your arguments morally correct .  during the era of abortion bans women would shove hangars down themselves ,1
1358,it would because people to be mentally unstable ,0
1359,so science says that the baby in the womb can feel pain has a beating heart  months after conception looks like a baby so the fact is . we all agree that a parent murdering their  year old is wrong and evil since the unborn is just as human as a  year old it is indeed just as wrong . it would be sensible to say that abortion is the same as a person killing their  year old baby ,0
1361,here is a vast amount of support in the united states for a ban on partial birth abortion ,0
1362,i will be taking the stance against abortion and will provide evidence that suggests the precedence of a living child being inside a mothers womb and that it is immoral and should be illegal to take an innocent victims life ,0
1363,tens of thousands of women have heart disease kidney disease severe hypertension sickle cell anemia and severe diabetes and other illnesses that are made worse by childbearing ,1
1365,you have yet to prove that a loving father in a committed relationship with a stable person has suffered the loss of a child due to an abortion he was not consulted about . this is religious faith based claim that has no grounding in any study performed to date nor can it be demonstrated by anecdotal evidence . it is used to reduce the physical contrast of the two in order to minimize pregnancy ,1
1366,if you plan to get an abortion which is premeditated then you are by definition committing murder . the fact that a fetus is a human being is undeniable . the baby is not just created in a womans womb out of nothing ,0
1368,rebutt  a fetus is not a rational or conscious agent and therefore does not hold a serious right to life . con  in article  from the declaration of human rights it says the everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration .  abortion is something that is routinely practiced by natural biological processes in nature but the kind of abortion in which the open your stomach and rip apart a human life is not a natural process ,0
1369,yet to believe personhood can be turned on and off like a light switch or that it would be permissible to kill a temporary comatose patient seems absurd but this is what a performance approach entails . this point is relatively uncontroversial as ultra liberal moral philosopher peter singer explains there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being . second as patrick lee points out this organism is fully programmed actively to develop himself or herself to the mature stage of a human being and will do so if unharmed  . on such a view the type of being is what grants personhood and all human beings including the unborn share the quality of having a disposition as a moral agent regardless of performance . even the alien persons would be protected in this scenario as a being with this valuable property flo . conclusioni want to close with the words of moral philosopher rosalind hursthouse who perfectly captures the profound nature of the issue to think of abortion as nothing but the killing of something that does not matter . abortion may be a contentious moral issue but providing easily accessible healthcare to women for example should not be controversial in the least . indeed singer whom pro cites admits as much we can see that the grounds for not killing persons do not apply to newborn infants . his cultured aliens would be persons due to the type of creature they are de facto rational agents . it also covers most adults as they have this desire and arguably even infants who have the implicit desire to live and it excludes the unborn . as such both infanticide and the killing of the disabled would be morally permissible on his view as neither would be persons with a right to life . slippery slope assuming pro holds that animals are not persons his restrictive performance criteria would have to exclude infants and people with low iqs . not only that but if pro s cultured aliens managed to operate without desires this account would exclude them as well ,0
1370,a lot of people call it abortion with babies and murder with adults but there is no difference they are both murder . hello and thank you for the debate none of the examples you brought up were abortion . i do not really understand your sentence about someone having to be born to die ,0
1371,as you are the instigator i will wait for you to post your arguments first ,0
1372,i also think incidentally that you could be personally against abortion but allow people to decide for themselves but only if you do not think it is certainly a person and are using the freedom issue . i acknowledge the society can have a say but I am simply saying if it says the laws are arbortion friendly it is rational not that it is analogous completely to areas where it can obviously exist . now there is the life and liberty of the putative child to consider . any differences of opinion we might have it seems would be an inherent value judgment call and tehres not much more to discuss . am i understanding you the main point you made is that any chance of no life is such that we should defer given the infinite loss potential versus the loss of the choice of the mother .  if no liberty there is no life . i realize that my stared quote is only certainly applicable to the person themself to decide to live and teh child does not have the chance or putatuive child ,1
1373,you should be a nice person to other people if you are supporting people to kill someone nside of you you are a monster ,0
1374,please state your opening argument ,0
1375,i think i am correct in thinking you believe the man in the dessert has no rights and therefore can be justifiably slaughtered i wonder if you d want tis if you were that man . you mention a government should prioritise over the fetus but surely exactly the same thing could be said in justification of killing a three year old who also depends on the parents efforts to survive . i think its unfair to say that the are doomed for a bad future many men are brought up in poor homes with single mothers and turn out great ,0
1377,and yet again i will yield this round in hopes that my opponent will have the opportunity to post a response before the end ,1
1378,instead of a real debate on a truly important topic you posted drivel . as a result i took  minutes to repost stats from a single site . thus by definition you appear to be the one with no life as you are wasting yours and other peoples time with stuff that you have no intention of fulfilling ,0
1379,most abortions are teen abortions most for teens wanting to have and not think about the because and effects of what they are doing ,0
1380,yes our societies do strive to affirm life as much as possible and to make the quality of life of our citizens as high as possible ,0
1381,there is nothing to be lostwhen a child is born his level of success will be determined by mostly environmental factors . when a child is aborted we are not losing what could have been . in fact we are not losing anything since there is no human being at the time of a legal abortion ,1
1382,my opponent has failed to produce any arguments to defend his her point ,0
1383,it was a good debate thank you ,1
1384,I am talking about fetuss indwelt by demons ,1
1385,as to your argument of population control though i am generally of the opinion that such detached weighing of outcomes is not a practice largely because i think it obvious that morality comes from a combination of natural feeling and reason and though perhaps such weighing is logical and so in some sense i find it that i feel it is abhorrent i must argue that even if one feels morally compelled to weigh matters of importance as such that the abolition of late term abortion does not because one to completely abandon the idea of population control as types of effective contraceptives are many and early abortions quite easy to carry out . many people look to the supernatural to provide an explanation as to how we are in some way different from the rest of nature and bound by laws in how we treat one another though this argument would in one way provide a source for these rights being that such an assertion is quite beyond my reasoning capability i will not try to tackle it . secondly i did not define a because i am not absolutely certain as to whether or not i would wish to confine the definition to only those stages of homo sapien development which are capable of thought . as to whether or not such would extend to our furry friends i hope that all my talk of homo sapien life stages made that clear and though it is immaterial to my argument i do happen to think that those which can be shown to think and feel in some manner are sympathetic to people and that they are also often naturally deigned worthy of rights in a manner similar to that i sketched out for people . my careful wording is because i believe that the argument that brain dead bodies are dead bodies and not really what we mean when we say has some merit and i do not wish to argue against it ,0
1386,vote samyul thanks everyone for reading the rather short debate we can all agree that these are not the type of debates we all look to read but unfortunately they happen ,1
1387,it does not matter if you are having a hard time following my arguement which i doubt because i did not put the period at the end of a sentence its the voters choice . unless of course you state otherwise in your  rulesi have no broken any of your  rules so you cannot say that I have somehow broken them . some might but your generalizing an entire population of women whose problems you do not knowthroughout this debate you have provided no sources to effictivley claim that having an abortion in the  or  trimester is selfish . if the voters voted on sources they would either vote for me or tie because you have given nothing to back up your claims except for  guess what that source was . whether it is anecdotal or not its a source ,1
1388,my opponent has to prove why abortion should be legal ,0
1389,con can assert that mere genetic humanity is so valuable and or grants personhood but that is all it is a mere assertion . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the sufferings dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . for example the right to life that is to say the right not to be killed god given as an absolute is untenable ergo killing something that is human is not necessarily murder . it gets worse again for con has con established beyond mere assertion and implication that god given rights are such that a woman can not have an early abortion . if you have to resort to such evasive tactics and disparaging remarks rather than deal with the actual argument maybe it is time to reconsider your position . the argument still here is that rights most plausibly derive from interests desires and in the early stages of pregnancy the human organism has no such interests . you know what is con who wants to argue early abortion is murder but when it is pointed out where this gets con just dismisses the analysis because it is too damaging for their position . this is why we look to reason and consequence beyond just mere assertion of said rights .  inalienability of the will your own body con does not seem to dispute that ones own body is not subject to the same restrictions as property due to the fact that you have unique control over ones own body . no conflict of rights interests in the embryonic period con points that rapists can just assert what rights we have presumably in such a way to allow rape . a case for unequal value  year old child vs   human embryos cons counter merely showed what happens when our rationality is comprised eg our own child is involved . maybe i was not clear enough what i was getting at is that such a right is untenable lest we live a world where our body it is various parts can be used against our will to save some one elses life . i maintain that without factors at play to compromise our rationality even pro lifers would have a hard time saving   day human embryos over one  year old child ,1
1390,if a female wants to change her mind about birthing another human then so be it especially if the circumstances are not fair ,0
1391,i ask that neither me nor my opponent show dead people pics ,0
1392,the fetus is not part of the woman but it does relate and can harm the women . if we are still banning abortion then it is a harm to the mothers liberty which contradicts this framework making it illegal as liberty is the  amendment and the government needs to give the life liberty and security of ones self and does not do its job hence it is illegal . round  as i have clearly said in my first round the fetus is no living and it does not meet all of the seven characteristics which are needed in life . the mother has the liberty but then it cannot harm others harm principle and the fetus does not count as other because it is not a living being . i will give the framework that i could not give last round even though there is no particular need in it . even though abortion was not a huge because of death there are a thousand every year and that is a lot but not in percentage . my opponent does not give any sources so technically all of the text that she gave are bare assertions . what the opponents list is a bare assertion and many of them are in my list and the fetus does not follow it . first of all there are illegal abortions in countries even the us is the point ,1
1393,I am like so totasly hot right now i could just go to yow house and put my waste ina yo mumma ,0
1394,there is an age restriction because some parents might not know what goes on and what if somethings goes wrong and the child dies they will be left in the dark as to what happened for the child to die ,0
1396,every individual has the potential to contribute in one way or another and taking the childs life before it has even had a chance to experience and contribute to the world undermines that potential ,1
1397,if there is anyone who is actually pro abortion I have never seen or heard of them ,1
1398,if you are trying to prove a point that the baby will remind them of this terrible horrific act and that it is so dramatizing that they would kill an infant do not use the word basically rape in unconsented sex . women seem to think that men take away a lot of their rights different topic but in fact i think that everybody should be able to do what they want with their bodies . as I have said before unless the mothers life is at risk you are third paragraph has no relevance to this debate at all . in a comment it said that i should use pro choice vs pro life to my advange . if that babies heart does not beat at a certain time it will anyone . if you do want to get pregnant that is your choice . sometimes i wish could i post one of those yellow and black signs that say . why should we take away life from a baby that does not even know what she he had been conceived out of . there are different ways to continue through life with the same often anti abortion people bring up the point of the babies right . you try to prevent it with condoms times pills etc . if you do not want to get pregnant that is your choice ,0
1399,the right to abortion is vital for gender equality banning abortion puts women at risk by forcing them to use illegal abortionists the right to abortion should be part of a portfolio of pregnancy rights that enables women to make a truly free choice whether to end a pregnancy these points just support my previous post ,0
1400,  autonomy however even if we assume that all fertilized eggs fetuses have personhood equal to that of a birthed child and they would all choose to force their biological parent to carry the pregnancy to birth which i do not believe is a solid assumption based on the reasons given in  i still do not believe this is sufficient justification for denying a person the right to an abortion . my point here is that the closer the fetus comes to being a the less likely a pregnant person is to abort and if they are it is often due to circumstances that are at least in some way beyond their control . i do not believe a pregnant person should have the right to enter a hospital a take eggs stored for in vitro fertlization ivf and smash them on the ground simply because they do not agree with the idea of human pregnancy . cats and dogs who are common companions to people and though cognitively very different from humans share some forms of communication with humans are more likely to be protected under animal abuse laws . if there is some force of nature or a that rules that abortion is morally unacceptable then what should we do about the unintentional abortions a k a miscarriages that as humans we do not yet have control over . i would also note that in the circumstances of late term abortions it is rarely a choice by the pregnant person to have such a late abortion . if we want to value the autonomy of an individual we must support the choice of a person who is demonstrating having an opinion on the circumstances before the inability to choose of a creature who has no ability to make a choice . this is because we have a better understanding of these animals in the sense that we recognize that they have thoughts and feelings and are able to interact with their environments on a more cognitive level than say a fish or a slug . to be clear though as regrettable as the loss of life of the abortum is we cannot allow the grief associated with that event to justify taking away the autonomy of a person . let us say that you disagree with  because you do not think deciding a moral system should be in the hands of humans themselves but it should be derived from a higher power beyond our control . even if a fetus nears personhood it is still inhabiting the body of another person who has the right to expel it if they desire .   personhood however while the egg fetus are both humans i would not classify either one as a true . the most commonly cited reason for taking longer to get an abortion was inability to make arrangements quickly  and this reason was cited about twice as frequently by poor women guttmacher  ,1
1401,yeah i guess you are right ,0
1402,hi I am mariah norton I am  years old and I am against abortion because it takes away the babys right to live and should have the right to develop and live it is not just the mom body . first of all people who are pro choice say that the baby is just a blob of cells and the mom should have the right to get an abortion because it is her body . also people who are pro choice say that the baby can not hear or feel pain or think . at  weeks from conception a baby can kick turn over make a fist open its mouth and press his or her lips together . also when they a done aborting the baby they throw the skull and every thing in the garbage can and it is bloody ,0
1403,if you are really in favor of a law against abortion consider the effect that this would have on society it would change our entire societys view towards sex see point  paragraphs above it would result in a large increase in pregnancies in which case we have to think about how large families would get how that would affect jobs economy etc . we are all people made up of good and bad and no other human who is no better than us in any manner has the right to decide when we die . if there is a law against abortion do you realize how many pregnant mothers you will have who are  opposed to their pregnancy .  we already do not have enough homes for all the children up for adoption . you say that women should take responsibility for their actions . some of these points may seem extreme but the fact is that there is so much more to think about when considering a law like this beyond the fact that a fetus will be allowed to be born .  there would be many men paying in child support potentially to more than one woman women who really did not want the child would still seek out an abortion that might be unsafe for her health . the shame that many of these women feel would need to change or are you really going to insist that every woman keep her child and then still look with scorn upon the young teenage mother . criminal history can depend on how a person was raised the setting they were raised in their mental stability drug use etc . this is something that men will never have to actually experience so it is easy for you to speak about because it is a decision you will never have to face . does this mean that all these things most of which are factors that someone cannot control should allow a person to be punished by death . yes it is ultimately the womans choice to abort but the fact is that the man is therefore exempt from all responsibility of having put this difficult choice on the woman when it is  his fault she is in the position of having to make that decision in the first place . clearly women who do not desire to get pregnant are doing what is necessary to not have to make the decision to have an abortion .  what if your daughter became pregnant because she was taken advantage of at age  by an older boy . yes it seems we do agree on the principle that abortion itself is a sad negative thing ,1
1404,you have to let anyone use this service before the first  weeks or else raped women will have nowhere to have an abortion because abortion clinics will all go out of business . but no woman should be forced by her government to have a child . however these are only a small number of women at abortion clinics . it is the womans choice of what to do with her body and no government should be so tyrannical as to force her to have an unwanted child or to get an illegal abortion which is likely to kill her and the baby .  here are some points of mine you never rebutted and therefore i should win upon unless you concede them or rebut them in the future science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks .  abortion laws are unconstitutional because they limit freedom and take lives of unhealthy women .  during the era of abortion bans women would shove hangars down themselves . a person who has not attained maturity or the age of legal majority . it is something in the womans body without feelings thoughts or life period ,1
1405,i mean if the mother wants the abortion then it shall happen i mean its not forced but i do not think that it should be banned ,1
1406,what about after the cord is cut since the baby is still completely dependent on others for survival and its brain is still not developed . assuming that terminating human life is wrong the central point of this issue is whether a fetus should be considered a human life . by this time a fertilized egg has already implanted in the uterus and is dividing cells .  even if an abortion happens immediately after pregnancy can first be confirmed  weeks the embryo has already begun developing a brain spinal cord and heart .  that separates plants and animals from things like water or rocks  an organismic state characterized by capacity for metabolism growth reaction to stimuli and reproduction starting with the first definition we must ask if an embryo has the ability to grow and change . all  chromosomes as well as the human specific dna that comes with them are present in the zygote the moment fertilization occurs . medically life is defined as the energy that enables organisms to grow reproduce absorb and use nutrients and evolve . at the very earliest moment a woman can know she is pregnant a fertilized egg has already begun to grow and change . i agree that abortion most commonly refers to induced pregnancy termination and that is what i will focus on . let us move on to another category . the combination of  chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in  chromosomes in the zygote . people love to bring this up but these cases make up only a minute fraction of total abortions performed . a miscarriage is not an abortion because the term implies a degree of intentionality ,0
1407,i was actually working on a paper for school on this very topic and just failed to find the time to respond ,1
1408,abortion is legal in the uk up to  weeks ,0
1409,under the vast unemployment rate bringing a child into this world that us humans live in is tough ,1
1410,the phenomenal difference that occurs in two years is absolutely immeasurable and can not be diminished to the eviction of a lump of vaguely human cells . you cited an abortion performed at  weeks which is only just into the third trimester the fetus being discussed would certainly be viable as a fetus but i do not see that its human status would be insured as of yet . though late term abortions are certainly an inhumane solution to the problem many women face in unwanted children i would disagree that it is comparable to killing a child who has taken its first breath ,1
1411,i take it that he is against abortion in all cases because he argues in his opening statement that anyone who does abortion should be killed without giving any clarifications or exceptions . my position on the matter therefore is that abortion should be allowed under some conditions and in some situations . I will be explaining this further in the next rounds ,1
1412,when you create a debate it is your responsibility to make sure that you can completely finish it without forfeiting . in fact abortion ought to be illegal expect in those three situations which i gave in my first round . pro has not successfully refuted this argument and his objections to it are all flawed and very weak as i clearly showed when i refuted them . more importantly does the fact that the world is harsh justify killing a fetus and thereby depriving it is right to become a fully grown human like us and have a life and a future like us .  rebuttal so pro is arguing that it would be better for the entire world and the people that reside upon it for that person to not be born because many people in the world have not enough food to eat and because many people have diseases like choleria etc . the fact that our world is harsh does not give us the right to deprive the fetus right to become a fully grown human being like us and have a future and a life like us and nor does it justify it . i have given a non religious but also still a reasonable reason i e the future argument refuting some of the most common objections to it as to why abortion should be illegal . there are many theories published though out the years stating a wide range of populations that the world would be able to sustane from one million people to one trillion . in  the united nations food and agriculture organisation released a report stating that there are  million poeple without enough food to eat . thus pros claim which is also the title of this debate that there are no non religious reasonable arguments for abortion to be illegal is false and refuted . i know it sounds harsh it sounds harsh to me too but the cold hard truth is that it would be better for the entire world and the people that reside upon it for that person to not be born ,0
1413,if this happened then you would never have to do abortion in the first place and because all of these doctors to have ptsd . so this way the baby can be raised properly and can be taught how to grow up and make good decisions . if it does not have a choice and the baby is innocent that is murder . if someone has a baby and knows they can not support it then they can send it to a family that is able to support . one of the arguments that my opponent brought up is that it protects the right of privacy in that they own their own body . if you are the baby about to be aborted whether you can feel it or not it is still murder . let us put yourself in the babies situation for a second ,0
1415,like say that fetus you aborted was the doctor that could cure cancer or ends proverty in  world countries abortion occurs in naturehumans will spend will tons of money to have surgery to kill the fetus and get it removed .  fetuses cannot feel and do not have a sense of mortal danger . you are pregnet for  months ,0
1416,if it does not then the doctor should be able to refuse the mother the ability to prevent a perfectly capable organism from being brought into the world . pro has failed to actually refute my opening construct the only argument he provided was that moms and dads should choose with no supporting evidence . I am not denying that women should have access to abortions I am arguing that they should not be the ones deciding to terminate the life . personhood begins after a fetus becomes able to survive outside the womb or after birth not a conception is there any reason this arbitrary time period in fetal development is any more correct than personhood beginning at conception . to what basis is it determined that parents would be better equipped to handle the decision to end prevent a life . I am sure you could ask any foster child as to whether they would rather be there or never have lived at all and get the former answer . this is a digression but the aim is to give women equal rights to men not to give them more of certain rights and men having other rights ,0
1417,not only does it ignore my main argument he actually copy pastes the vast majority of his argument from the following website it was quite easy to suspect and find that he copypasted his argument . as i argued in my previous argument if a fetus does not have the mental requirements to be a person defined philosophically as a rational sapient entity then it is not murder and therefore not immoral to kill a fetus . whatever it was it lead to a lackluster argument being used in his last round how depressing . i was expecting for him to develop on the importance of instrospection and such but it seems his response was anticlimatic of sorts . however i just want to point out the intellectual dishonesty of my what my opponent has done ,1
1418,there is no guarantee that it is the best decision for both parties and how could it be that way if one of the parties dies non consensually . if abortion was illegal the choice would be much simpler and the abortion rate would decrease which is what both the left and the right want to accomplish . a fetus should be a child when they have all the necessary chromosomes to be so ,0
1419,as i stated before abortion is a big deal it can because serious psychological impairment to the woman in the form of depression an guilt . should a person be so irresponsible to land up in a situation where they have to be merciless to the unborn . and the mothers life in danger does not always have to have a reason to have an abortion she might just have a miscarriage in the early period which could lead to having an abortion but that did not mean she wanted that to happen things can go right and wrong . if your not ready to have a child and you get pregnant abortion is not an answer . choosing adoption as an alternative to abortion would give the baby it is right to live ,0
1420,many americans have looked away from their faith by now or finally understand that their religious views should not determine the laws and actions of a government that does not back one specific religion . leviticus   they shall not make baldness upon their head neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their flesh . aborting a baby when it is still in the earliest stages of development what is most commonly done is no different than a man masturbating and killing his sperm cells ,1
1421,interesting that he does not even reference any of my previous examples detailing how this is not so . my opponent has failed to give any form of argument for how sentience overrides ones right to bodily sovereignty thereby conceding it is inferior to it . sentience does not permit one to violate bodily sovereignty this proves bodily sovereignty holds power over sentience not the other way around . my opponent claims that bodily sovereignty cannot exist without sentience and while i agree i show how bodily sovereignty overrides ones sentience when determining morality . so yes even without free will it still must observe the idea of bodily sovereignty because the idea is not concerning it but the mother . they never attempt to show a situation wherein ones sentience allows one to violate anothers bodily sovereignty . i take this as a concession to the fact that bodily sovereignty will always override sentience ,0
1422,saying that the baby would serve as an emotional reminder of what happened in the past is not the way out although i sympathise with victims of rape who have conceived babies for their attacker i say to you please keep in mind that there are happy couples out there who have tried for years to get pregnant but simply can not because on infertility so for you to have that ability to bring a precious soul into this world and give it up is saddening . that is abortion because of medical reasons i can not say to you that the correct thing to do in a situation like that is to save the baby and leave the mother to die because the mother may have a husband who loves her and have already attached to her so in a situation like this where it is strictly for medical purposes and abortion seems to be the only way to save the motherls life then i agree that it should be allowed . if abortion is legallised without boundaries then this will just be an easy way out for women to become sexually active even more than before and not have to worry about giving birth ,0
1423,this occurs when the zygote then becomes embedded into the endometrium lining of the uterus where it forms a placenta for the purpose of receiving essential nutrients through the uterus wall . in medicine pregnancy is defined as beginning when a fertilized zygote becomes implanted in a womans uterus . in pregnancy the  stages are commonly referred to as zef meaning zygote embryo fetus ,0
1424,I am using the first round to explain the debste my oponent may start with his argument or may just forfeit or say whatever he wants ,0
1425,i would argue that its highly immoral to grant such power over another human life as to define it as a living thing or not based solely on a decision whatever the decision may be . in essence if a man hits a woman in the womb and kills the fetus regardless of the stage he will be tried for not one but possibly two accounts of murder depending on the mothers health . if the woman wants child support and decides to come after the man she is more than likely if he is not disabled awol or dead going to get it . the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime . and personally it was horrific to see a baby squirming for its life when a vacuum was ripping it to pieces from inside do not mean an emotional appeal to be the foundation of my argument but i find that some merit can be drawn from this if you want to google it and see what I have seen . another classic contradiction is if a fetus survives the abortion it is then considered a human life and people have to try to save its life under the born alive infants act . but if you get pregnant then it should be seen as a responsibility to at least deliver the child and set it up for adoption if you do not want it . and to the contrary i would argue men were seen as tools to a higher degree than that of women . essentially if a mother wants to abort it for any reason she chooses then its not a human . the man does not have the right to self preservation and is forced to work to support the mother and child on their terms . yes the property did in fact go to the man but the man had to legally provide a standard of living suitable to the family ,1
1426,and again I am sure if you ask any of those in those poverty situations if they would have rather been aborted almost none of htem would say yes . and it is not truly ineffective as when things like that are stated as a matter of principle it does affect their thinking . i do not think it is pointless though for all the reasons i gave above as a matter of principle . at first glance it might seem con is arguing that if we want abortion to be hindered we have to have teeth to the laws . but given she does bring it up i would argue we should defer to when the infants feel pain . but there is more than that if we argue te principles involved . at least it has no bearing given i did not contest or say otherwise . if we have to use pain killers to because abortions without pain which i admit are possible that should tell us something about the morality of what they are doing . con really had no point in bring up that babies feel no pain as i did not contest or says othewise ,0
1428,according to the meriam webster dictonary that has several defintions to fit all the needs of people who claim to know when life starts a the quality that distinguishes a vital and functional being from a dead body b a principle or force that is considered to underlie the distinctive quality of animate beings a the sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual both of these examples of defintions are very subjective and leave us with questions what is a principle or a force that is distinctive of animate beings . several religious groups and persons have claimed to go against abortion because of their religion usually this religion is christiantity hosea    hosea prays for god s intervention . ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb . any and all arguments based on moral grounds are unacceptable when it comes to this topic . just because someone disagrees with youvr stance on sometnig does not mean you can tell them what to do ,1
1429,when you feel better we can repost our opening rounds and continue the debate ,1
1430,i would agree with you about abortion is no longer applicable after  weeks but i would argue that science has proven that its unsafe in every stage for the mother as well as the baby . first of all we do not have to take in account the state of the parents because obviously the parents of this unfortunate being did not take in account their finances lifestyle or responsibility of the consequences of their actions while they were doing their thing . no one is guaranteed a good life whether you are rich or poor ,0
1431,also consider if the actions of the two consenting parties do not directly harm anyone besides the consenting parties how can that be considered immoral ,1
1433,my opponent has gone off and provided me with some random facts that make their arguments seem a lot longer than it actually is . if a  year old wants an abortion then they should not be pressured by others who advise her not to have one . teenagers my opponent makes quite a clumsy mistake by saying if that is the only problem here we need a change of attitude in our society and i think we should work on that instead of encouraging abortion for young children . telling me when a woman is in her best shape to have children does nothing to support your side and it does nothing to contradict my argument . rape rape is an issue regarding abortion just because over  of women who got raped did not choose an abortion that does not mean that you can completely take out rape cases out of this debate ,1
1434,for the first round please just accept the debate ,0
1435,from what i gather of his comments in the comments section I am supposed to just say what i believe and he will observe it .  one can extend some of what i said above to fully grown adults who are too retarded to rake care of themselves . if it were born it would be a burden on the mother itself and society . say the baby was prenatally diagnosed with a rare disease which made it paralyzed from the neck down be in constant pain and mentally retarded . what i had stated in my opinion on abortion is not a guideline just an assertion that there are cases where it is better for one decision to be made for another person rather than having them make it themselves . what if the baby has a debilitating disease that renders him unable to feel happiness but the mother out of her selfish desire to raise an offspring decides to keep it . she would gain her utility society would see her suffering and learn that giving birth to a sad baby is bad . yes i believe that if a person does not have to capacity to ask for their own rights then they have no rights . when he is hooked up a hypothetical machine that constantly injects dopamine serotonin adrenalin or any other chemicals into his brain without building any resistance he is happy and that is what he is looking for regardless of what noble causes he believe he is looking for . if she wants to kill the baby when it is not born what makes her suddenly want to keep it alive after it is born . the most practical thing would be to leave it up to mother . babies who can not even put  and  together do not deserve rights . i believe i am the best at benefiting myself in some cases but i other cases I would rather lay taxes . the problem with society is that it looks at abortion as inherently bad . the mother loses utility if she is forced to give birth and the baby does not have the capacity to have utility ,1
1436,abortion whether therapeutic or illegal is in the main no longer dangerous because it is being done well by physicians ,1
1437,but a teenage mother who was just careless should not be able to abort her child because of her irresponsible actions she needs to learn from her mistakes the raped victim however did not do anything wrong but be at the wrong place at the wrong time . but still then i do not agree with abortion I am just more understanding in those cases because of the emotional impact it could have on the mother and then later affect the child . the mother may have trouble holding or giving affection to her child because the child could resemble the rapist or could be just a constant reminder of that one incident so that could because psychological issues in the child later on and may lead to them becoming violent in society ,0
1438,if those people are that irresponsible they were likely to be so prior to a change in abortion law ,1
1440,you argue that abortion only endangers the lives of   women and that it decreased . all arguments notwithstanding i do not feel that con deserves or merits votes in this debate due to his sheer disrespect of this community .  you do not see how the points are relevant to the argument even though you admit that legalized abortions are now safer than ever . that said akmath has also moved the goal posts of this debate though i must admit i got caught up in it a bit as well focusing a lot on when life begins and the viability of fetuses rather than the issue at hand whether legalized abortion has done more good than harm . you also say that guttmacher institute considered abortions to be safe  years ago . yes they are saving money by not providing a range of services such as foster care education welfare and the adoption of children who have physical and mental disabilities . perhaps you also think it is wise to save money by not funding research and development into the cure of deadly diseases . again you have cited but not told us what that refers to . even if you already knew this statistic it is possible voters did not and that does not change the relevance to the topic ,0
1441,i cannot make my argument this round ,1
1442,like I have said in my first post first between the nazis attempt to justify their murder by dehumanizing their target and liberals claiming that unborn children are not human which of course they are as one of their main justifications for their malicious deeds . ok first off with your do you know if it refers to topics where hitler and the nazis is the original subject of the conversation . because it would be ridiculous if a conversation went like this guy a gee adolf hitler was a mean guy ,0
1443,the minimum character limit has to go ,1
1444,women have abortions to choose when to have children based on their age financial stability and relationship stability . it is quite heart breaking that so many women die during legal abortions but if abortions were illegal it would not stop them and women seeking an abortion would find one by unsafe and illegal means so it is best to provide a safe and legal means of abortion . it is not the governments position to legislate against womens choices ,1
1445,as i stated before it should not matter the stage of a fetuss development when an abortion takes place because a fetus is not a living human being until it has been birthed . it seems though that you are advocating the blatant oppression of women and the nationalization of uteruses . this assertion is contingent upon the facts that aborted fetuses feel minimal pain and that it should be a womans right to chose what she does with her own body . well i am telling you that there is rarely a situation in which a woman receives an abortion to which a does not apply . it is my firm claim that there is nothing morally unjust with receiving an abortion for any case whatsoever . it is therefore evident that women should hold the inalienable right to receive an abortion at any point . through this debate you have shown little scientific evidence and have ignored all the reasons a woman would have for receiving an abortion ,1
1446,while a law that mitigates the damages done by this would be ideal such a law could not be implemented without having detrimental effects towards women in different situations where the fathers may use such tools to because harm case in point rapists wanting parental rights over children born out of sexual assault . there is a small paradox at the center of the argument that cannot be legislated or debated in court if you are in a relationship with something that discounts your concerns regarding your unborn child that may not be a legal issue but a personal decision that cannot be undone . or they would decide that they are not ready for a child and agree to terminate the pregnancy despite the difficulty and guilt surrounding the implications of their decision . the flip side is the emotional part of a man learning that his childs life has been terminated without his knowledge consent or having his concerns addressed . to claim that the legalities of a hypothetical situation must fit your opinion removes the idea that the problem in society needs to be identified .  in excess of three million is a figure I have heard before but i will have to nail down a supported figure . the idea that a man can have a legal say over a womans body is the core of the argument ,1
1447,definitions explanations restricted abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy . round  is for acceptance only no arguments to be presented in round  . the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age ,1
1448,sure feel free to start it again ,0
1449,another common argument is that the unborn fetus is not yet living at the time of abortion . abortions can be done up to  weeks into the pregnancy . what i do not understand is why the person least involved in the matter at all the baby is being punished most severely ,0
1450,pain perception some humans such as those in comas or the disabled do not feel pain but we recognize their general right to live . there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being and the same is true of the most profoundly and irreparably intellectually disabled human being even of an infant who is born anencephalic literally without a brain .  human fetuses have a right to live   premise  abortion directly kills an innocent human being  abortion violates the fetus right to life and is therefore immoral   con may argue that the unborn child s right to life is not violated because they have no right to use their mother s body without her consent . as philosopher francis beckwith argues the pro life view is that human beings are persons in community and have certain natural obligations as members of their community that arise from their roles as mother father citizen child and so on . while children may not have a right to extraordinary care like the donation of a parent s organs pregnancy is the universal means to provide unborn humans with the basic necessities of food water and shelter . they claim that the ability to feel pain have rational thought or live independently outside of the womb are necessary conditions for personhood that fetuses lack . a human fetus after all is simply a human being at a very early stage in his or her development . david boonin author of a defense of abortion writes perhaps the most straight forward relation between you and me on the one hand and every human fetus on the other is this all are living members of the same species homo sapiens .  finally even at the earliest stages a human embryo is a whole human organism on a path of self directed development . in contrast many animals for example pigs feel pain but are not given the same right to life that human beings have .   the right to live and receive care from their parents is not dependent on the born or unborn child s level of development or degree of dependency but on his or her identity as a member of the human species . premise  fetuses are human beings or members of our species this premise is held without significant controversy in scientific philosophical and legal arenas . for example embryology textbooks used in medical schools affirm that fertilization a k a conception is the first landmark in the development of a human being ,0
1451, just look at this picture of a train from japan no train expert but i have a feeling that the japanese train shown is more technologically advanced than any government controlled amtrak train . again look at amtrak if the government is controlling the commoddity trains abortion etc then it would be in the best interest of the government to create a monopoly for itself with cumbersome regutions and licensing so that they can make more money . according to nr in  congress passed the passenger rail investment and improvement act priia which endowed amtrak with the powers of a regulatory agency that makes decisions in conjunction with the department of transportation about scheduling uses of available tracks maintenance and other metrics and standards that compel certain behavior by the entire you s rail industry . if government got into the abortion business it would have the power to regulate and control the abortion business enough to the extent that the government would crush all of its opposition in the free market . sure pro did not explicitly say that the government would threaten people with fines violence imprisonment in order to make them pay for abortion clinics but i say how else would the government get people to pay for things if they refuse . freight rail entities which actually are private understandably objected and the d c circuit agreed with them that priia was an unconstitutional delegation of governmental regulatory power to a private entity . like i said even dollars and change can mean the world to people who live eating only one meal a day while living paycheck to paycheck and the government would literally be stealing those dollars and change from the poor in order to pay for the abortions of rich people who just did not feel like wearing a condom one day ,0
1452,there is no reason we can not have laws that are not enforced no matter what is customary . it makes you wonder about whether he really has much to say in terms of substance at all . semantics are always beside the point ,0
1453,special rights are enacted by the authority these people have submitted themselves for example you s army will prioritize the protection of you s citizen in war even though it could mean the death of innocent civilian from different country . your argument are made with the which is deemed much smaller than the good coming toward the parents with abortion they do not have to carry burden the mothers life is safe . meaning that if they are unlucky enough to be aborted well although this sounds cruel that is a lottery of birth and it will not know seeing that it is not alive in the first place . right now our option are basically to either force the mothers to born the son with possible huge consequences or leave the choice at their hand . same goes here it is true that there are those that want to take risk but we cannot generalize it for the whole society ,1
1454,unlike most other pro choice arguments it is not based on whether the fetus is a person so i will not be contesting that point i am skeptical as to whether the fetus can be considered a member of the moral community but i see this as nonessential . i believe that a person is the sole owner of his or her body and has total discretion in its use . i accept trent hs challenge on the morality of abortion ,1
1455,thanks to con for creating this debate and i look forward to hopefully a great debate ,1
1456,I am not entirely pro choice but i do believe that the mother has a right to decide who lives if her life is in danger ,0
1457,as my graph in round  shows it is medical developments not legislature that statistically determine the danger of abortions . introductionmy opponent seems to contradict himself in his arguments as he claims that morals do not really exist yet he bases most of his arguments on how abortion could reduce suffering . the correlation is better explained by the fact that medical science is far more developed in countries where abortion is legal than countries where abortion is illegal and so the fact that abortion is safer in countries where it is legal is not because it is legal but instead it is down to superior medical development . in other words it is not demonstrated that history of consciousness has any relevance to the permissibility of killing . but for the purposes of this round or until con specifies otherwise i will presume that con believes that we ought to reduce suffering and that he is disingenuous in claiming that there are no morals .  but this can be absurdly applied to other scenarios for example stealing is dangerous so it is also cruel to risk a womans health possibly life because they disagree with one on stealing . no it does not the reason why this is fallacious is because the height and hairiness of people is not relevant to whether we are justified in killing them . so i am not sure as to which position con actually believes as the assertion that we ought to reduce suffering coupled with the assertion that there are no morals is a contradictory pairing . we would be just as justified in killing them outside the womb since the reason why we are killing them in the first place is not dependent on whether they are born or not .  the thing is whether a person is born or not has no relevance to the eugenical aim of why we are killing them . finally con writes it is also cruel to risk a womans health possibly life because they disagree with one on abortion . in other words just because someone believes that a wrong action is right it does not entitle them to considerations of their safety when undertaking said act . although the fatal flaw in the argument lies in cons last line i understand that going around killing people with disorders is very bad but abortion is different as i have explained ,0
1458, firstly to assert that abortions should only be performed for maternal safety so as to leave a viable vessel for possible future progeny is to admit that women are nothing more than chattel to be viewed inexorably as life support systems for fetuses and potential runny noses and skinned knees . in roe v wade the constitutional right to privacy was weighed with the states interest in the fetus and it was found that severely limiting a womens agency over her reproductive biology did not pass constitutional muster . finally please note that i am from south africa where abortion is one hundred percent legal . by this argument women must either practice celibacy the only  guaranteed form of contraception well almost if you count the immaculate conception or else risk being the hostages of their reproductive biology up until to the age of final fertility . this belief is based on the idea that there is a set of natural processes which eventually leads to a human being outside of the womb let us for the sake of argument tentatively agree that life at least in potential occurs at conception . i am afraid that unless pro can produce evidence that abortion is directly linked to this premise would be shaky at best . in the interest of time and attention i will for the first round attempt to confine my points specifically to those raised by the instigator . i feel that there are arguments especially relating to autonomy and agency which can be related to scenarios outside of the womb but i dismiss the imagined outcome of denigrating human life as being automatic or guaranteed . i assume that pro wishes to converge on the question because pro anticipates this would demonstrate that if life is said to exist then objectively it cannot be taken away . would this then extend to and cover all forms of human intervention that assists or ends life e g should we take polio vaccines . if not they will help inform the debate going forward a brief riposte by pro in part or whole would be appreciated if birth control was practiced but failed if the pregnancy is a product of rape if the pregnancy is a product of an incestuous relationship if the pregnancy is part of an arranged or child marriage if a significant risk exists of passing on a genetically transferable disease if pregnancy is a result of mis or under education if the women was not in a culpable state of mind at the time of conception this includes acute and chronic psychological states of mind affected by neurophysiology or external factors ,1
1459,abortions should only be allowed before the end of the womens first trimester the first  months after the first three months the only option for the unborn child should be adoption ,0
1460,but nobody forced my parents to conceive me in order to allow me to live with a good future . it is not a case of protecting the killed but of punishing the killer . bodily autonomy is the reason that rape and assault are wrong . we all deserve reproductive rights and if they would been forced to have me that would have caused more harm to them than the harm to me if I would never existed as a sentient feeling being . it is merely a matter of protecting bodily autonomy more on that in a bit . they are not an all or none thing lack of one does not eliminate all the other reasons . if i think of more I will include it in the comment section mmmkay ,1
1461,so you agree that an unborn baby is an egg that never hatched ,1
1462,first however it is imperative to come to some sort of conclusion about what an abortion actually does whether it is a termination of life or not . levatino explains the time it takes for the type of abortion in question and says s life is seriously threatened by her pregnancy a doctor more often than not doesn t have  hours much less  hours to resolve the problem . if a mother was incapable of taking care of her  year old son and opted to kill him she would be reviled by the entire world and taken to court for murder . b simple reason and common sense when a doctor performs an abortion he removes the as they call it always avoiding the term and throw it away . this patient s pregnancy was a threat to her life and the life of her unborn child . in short though abortions both surgical and medical taking pills are prone to such side effects which could range from severe depression and abdominal pain to heart attacks strokes and in extreme cases even death . there is a clear summary of the risks from puja lalwani writing for buzzle com however due to space constraints i cannot fit all of it into this debate . if she is unable or unwilling to take care of the child let her give it up for adoption but the baby has the right to life just as much as the mother doess choice is just as important as the mother s . in this debate i will seek to show that contrary to the claim of the pro speaker abortion is wrong both from the standpoint of health and also from a moral standpoint . b abortion risks the mother s health this has been well documented and is not hard to find even by just searching the internet for the information . that can be read here in the words of dr . point  abortion compromises and does not benefit the mother s health now the moral implications of an abortion should be more than enough to convince us that abortion is unacceptable . not only is abortion an immoral practice but it does not render a benefit to the mother . point  life begins at conception a scientific evidence from the moment the male sperm is joined with the female egg all of the dna that will ever be present in the child that will later be born is already present . the girl has been done a grave wrong but the fact that she has been done wrong does not give her the right to then do an even worse wrong to the baby she now carries ,0
1464,in fact before the supreme court case more than  of the illegal abortions were done by medical professionals with high standing in their fields . this argument is irrelevant to the debate as it is after fertilization when a sperm and an egg become an embryo which you accept is a human being . however rebuttals are not until round  which states pro rebuts con s case and vice versa i will proceed by refuting the arguments danielle made in round  but not his her rebuttals which i will address in round  . the  amendment states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the  amendment does not grant these rights to animals and plants but persons . as stated in the resolution if the mother s life is truly in danger she should be able to access the proper medical procedure . meanwhile if you intentionally shoot a man meaning to kill him or if you order or pay an assassin to do the killing the person for you then you will be charged with either murder or conspiracy of murder . con states that violating a person s bodily autonomy has no legal or moral basis yet advocates that the bodily rights of the unborn can be violated if it yields cures to various diseases . con fails to make a connection why the actions of people should be related to how the pro life ideology should be judged . despite the fact that slavery has been banned in over  countries we have the back alley version of slavery known as human trafficking . the main thing wrong with this argument is that con does not prove that the human rights to life and bodily autonomy require the precedence of consciousness . even if abortion laws do not prevent these back alley abortions there are still fundamental flaws in this argument ,0
1465,nevertheless in the case i found myself in that scenario i would still insist that the course of action would be for her to get an abortion . even if you were a vegetarian why would the issue of abortion be more pressing than these animals when the amount of animals slaughtered for consumption is notably greater than the fetuses being aborted in addition to the fact that the animals consumed are fully formed . on the other hand i think that discussing the morality of killing someone is superfluous when it comes to this issue since the issue can be cut off altogether without raising questions of morality as i will now proceed to explain . if you have any questions or something is unclear please bring that up as well . the demand for adoption is not great enough to meet the supply already . if you wish to challenge the reasoning behind which i arrived at my view on the death penalty please fire away . the death penalty however might have been justified in the times of louis xvi and marie antoinette because at the time there were no other forms of securing the usurpers from harming the population such as by putting them in secure prisons . i could go on writing on this issue but since at the end of the line we both agree I will leave the decision of continuing this discussion up to you . but the reason this is done is not because it is the governments duty administer retribution the reason we punish those who break the law is because this is necessary to keep society safe which is precisely the governments job ,1
1466,we are not something different than what we were at conception but instead we are the same being at a different stage of development much like how a child is still of the same biological material an adult is but is not at the same stage of growth .  as explained in my introduction through human dignity and our unalienable rights we are afforded the right to life not only by society but by humanity as a whole . conclusion every abortion takes the life of an unborn member of the human race violating the unalienable right to life of that human and eroding the human dignity of that child . seeing this as true if there is a morally justifiable reason that i be killed there must also be a morally justifiable reason for killing an unborn child but because that child has done no evil it is life should not be terminated . as americans we have established that the right to life is an unalienable right and is to never be taken away unless the rights of the individual is taken away due to actions they have committed against the society .  from the moment of conception to our death we are all full fledged members of humanity . introduction i will be arguing that the woman should not have the choice to abort a child due our unalienable right to life and the very basics of our human dignity ,0
1467,if a person who does not know there alive but is age  is it ok to kill them . thank for the tips but with the fetus you said that some babies are born with no lims and some do not even know there alive . i give thanks for this doing this debate with me ,0
1468,another question for you is if a man is required to pay child support why can the man not make the decision to force an abortion as he is just as financially responsible for the child as the mother . that seems to be a form of sexism as only females can choose abortions what happened to equal rights under the law regardless of gender nationality religion etc . also in america we have a policy called which means you do not have to prove you did not do it in order to be found innocent . the difference between late term abortions and the death penalty is that late term abortions only kill the innocent by the decision of one person while the death penalty only kills those found guilty through the decisions of many individuals based on proper court procedures . it is the womans decision body and it should be respected ,0
1469,again once the baby is out of the womb and enters the world people stop caring and no longer give a damn . i do not even think the infants themselves have brains yet I am unsure but there is certain restrictions on if it is too late to get abortions and i think they do them before the brain form so correct me if I am wrong . people can argue all they want about bettering the mother or the baby but what it comes down to is that abortion is the murdering an unborn fetus . so I am going to make a few rebuttals against your post here and maybe add a few others things . again I am not saying every baby is going to come out a bad apple or a genetic freak with diseases but i would again say the chances are not good in those type of cases . abortion again is currently a free choice and as for it being morally wrong sometimes it is the right thing to do like taken a terminally I will family member off life support . now to go back to the female she should not have to be restricted and carry the burden regardless of her choice and be forced to carry an unwanted baby ,1
1470,the similar procedure after the fetus may be able to survive on its own is medically known as a late termination of pregnancy . the term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy . a staff member at your local planned parenthood health center can discuss abortion and all of your options with you and help you find the services you need . the debate over whether or not abortion should be a legal option continues to divide americans . abortion is the ending of pregnancy by the removal or forcing out from the womb of a fetus or embryo before it is able to survive on its own ,1
1471,the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse . the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse . the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse . the correlation i am getting to is if you have intercourse protected or not the female may become pregnant . being pro choice and anti death penalty is not contradicting however because they are two separate things ,1
1472,pro has essentially conceded the last  rounds and given the balance of evidence in the prior rounds it is pretty clear that she has given up on the debate ,0
1473,i appreciate your concession ,0
1474,according to the you s supreme court a person is to get their age when they are out of the mothers womb and breathing oxygen starting at the  mark eventually working their way up to be  years old ,1
1475,no one can tell a women if she wants to have a baby or not and therefore should chose what she wants to do ,1
1476,a case for unequal value  year old child vs   human embryos consider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door is a canister of   day human embryos which are perfectly viable and will remain so as long as they are immediately removed from the building and returned to cold storage . like wise it is argued a pregnant women can take action to be unplugged from the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with a pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep some one else alive such is yours hers bodily rights autonomy inalienability of the will your own body grape argues as follows . in this analogy you are kidnapped in order to keep some violinist alive by having your body connected to theirs so your kidneys can filter poisons out from the violinist if you were to unplug from he violinist they will die . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the sufferings dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . also consider if such an abortion is viewed as murder the rapist gets convicted of rape but following after is the woman who he raped is now in court because she had such an abortion and thus gets convicted of murder . if i agree to take you on an airplane ride under the obligation that i will not at   feet i cannot change my mind and toss you out because i have given up my ownership of the airplane to that extent . if i agreed to work for you for a year for free and then change my mind the most you can do is demand material property as compensation you cannot enslave me without aggressing against my rightsin using a mother s body against her will a fetus carries out exactly this kind of aggression . but as i argue they are not equal and even pro lifers would have a hard time choosing to save   human embryos over one  year old child . i know of no anti abortion person who says that you can not choose to disconnect as rejecting such a bodily right means everyone would live in danger of say a kidney being taken against their will if it could save some one else ,1
1477,let us look at some of the effects on women who have abortions physical problemselevated risk of death a  government funded study in finland women who abort are approximately four times more likely to die in the following year than women who carry their pregnancies to term . psychological problemsrequirement of psychological treatment a study of the medical records of   california medicaid patients revealed that women who had abortions were  percent more likely than delivering women to be hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in the first  days following abortion or delivery . my opponent has basically referred to every persons mother on this site as an extreme pervert because the only criteria that he provided was that they were not using birth control or a condom . this is true of both immediate complications and of long term reproductive damage . the lowest incidence rate of ptsd reported following abortion is  . these problems may include one or more of the following loss of pleasure from intercourse increased pain an aversion to sex and or males in general or the development of a promiscuous life style . these increased cancer rates for post aborted women may be linked to the unnatural disruption of the hormonal changes which accompany pregnancy and untreated cervical damage or to increased stress and the negative impact of stress on the immune system . these findings support previous research which reported that during the year following an abortion women visited their family doctors  more for all reasons and  more for psychosocial reasons . increased rate for teenagers teenagers who account for about  percent of all abortions are also at much high risk of suffering many abortion related complications . ptsd while psychological reactions to abortion fall into many categories some women experience all or some of they symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd . handicapped newborns abortion is associated with cervical and uterine damage which may increase the risk of premature delivery complications of labor and abnormal development of the placenta in later pregnancies . eating disorders for at least some women post abortion stress is associated with eating disorders such as binge eating bulimia and anorexia nervosa . suicide researchers in finland have identified a strong statistical association between abortion and suicide in a records based study see figure at the right . approximately  of patients who are not infected by chlamydia develop pid within  weeks after a first trimester abortion . alcohol drugs over twenty studies have linked abortion to increased rates of drug and alcohol use ,0
1478,for example a family acquaintance of mine learned that the fetus in her womb had organs that were growing on the outside of its body . the parent can not be held accountable for what we know now is faulty science and should actually be commended for making a huge sacrifice for what they truly believed to be the greater good . would aborting the baby change history and totally erase the rape in every way shape and form . in the cases where the birth of the child would because immense suffering or death to othersi m adding a third scenario in which abortion would be moral . if a parent completely believed these predictions were true then i cannot fault them for deciding to abort a child in order to save those around them . there were some situations in which through the trusted method of divination it was determined that if a particular child were allowed to be born it would bring death destruction or great suffering on a community . this one is not very applicable in the present day but applies more when we are looking back through history at choices made in the past . however forcing a woman to carry that child to term has the potential to traumatize her on a scale much greater than the actual rape itself . i argue that in this instance it is most moral to make the choice that causes the least suffering . in cases of rapemy opponents questions are valid and i will answer each is it the unborn babys fault the woman got raped . the mother elected to spare her child that suffering and had an abortion ,1
1479,abortion should be restricted because some people will become irresponsible having unprotected sex knowing that she will do abortion and it can increase rates of infection ,0
1481,as for the third reason my opp gave i do not really understand how that pertains to the debate . i have no idea how quick nine months goes by for any pregnant woman let alone a rape victim but it certainly is not forever . thank you to my opp for the compliments i suppose under those circumstances in which my opp gave that might be acceptable regarding deformities however would my opp concur that these days most things detected in the womb could be fixed . if not then all three parties in the above paragraph win with the adoption . the mother can get involved in this type of therapy and be healed ,0
1482,and not even getting into much of anything in terms of actual substance in the debate for why it should or should not be that way etc . con is just ranting it seems like about things that strike unjust to him but reading too much into the things to begin with and then blowing htem out of proportion . but again I have said nothing that would indicate this ,0
1483,i will be arguing that abortion is generally immoral in all cases apart from when the mothers health is at serious risk ,0
1484,to be fair i will admit that anyone who is willing to step up and care for these unwanted children deserves my utmost respect and silence on the matter but they are obviously a rarity so their position does not change my view on the majority . furthermore i believe that anyone who is adamantly pro life is obligated to adopt as many children as possible . only   families adopted children last year in the usa that number does not appear to be big enough to support pro life expectations ,1
1485,no actually i chose to be a woman on tuesday thursday saturday and sometimes sunday depending on the weather . you are stealing the babies first breath . abortion should be completely illegal with the exception of endangering a mothers life ,0
1486,well i was expacting a reply but it looks like i got none ,0
1487,they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own . but then you must also argue other natural things such as disease must be allowed to run their course without treatment disease is natural and if by having sex you are consenting to pregnancy why would not touching a toilet seat be consenting to whatever disease may be present on the toilet seat . an acorn is never defined as an oak tree so why should a clump of cells be defined as a person . c it is wrong to kill unborn innocent babies the conclusion does not follow because it relies upon the first two premises . if you have sex you must accept responsibility i know ask the question why is sexual intercourse a contract for pregnancy . for example if i drive a car on a rainy day does this mean i consent to a car accident which can because harm to me and possibly kill me . since there was no consent for the creation of the human the human is akin to being the product of rape . life is dangerous and almost anything we do has the potential for danger man acknowledges this but man does not consent to danger . why is it that in no other circumstance other than abortion do people argue taking the risk equals consent for the damages and the waiving of the right to mitigate these damages . if you argue against this then your premise regarding abortion is misogynist and only seeks to unequally render the health and bodily integrity of those who can get pregnant meaningless and not the population as a whole . pregnancy is a contract keep in mind they imply many of these claims  . to further my point simply acknowledging a risk does not mean implicit consent for the risk . my opponent takes the bop in an attempt to fulfill it presents three main arguments which i will show below  ,1
1488,i think it should because if a woman is raped she should not have to have the baby ,1
1489,by medical standards human life begins at conception ,0
1491,as an example i used to have someone in my school who had a stammer of course its a minor problem which normally can be overcome with support but unfortunately for him everyone bullied him and it got to the stage when i said hello to him and he told me to f off now i know this is just one school but he became very antisocial to people who were trying to be nice to him . as for it being a excuse for murder it is a double edged blade whilst killing the child is wrong and unjust and letting the child be born and its life is that of poverty and neglect . clarification and development i agree in that the parents do not matter in the sense that they should not get to decide if they want a child but we have to make sure the child life is going to be one where it can prosper and develop because if the parents do not care for their child then it could lead to a life of abuse neglect etc ,1
1492,the non christians may also respond but please be respectful of other comments if you are father got you pregnant would any if the women out the get an abortion ,1
1493,again i will yield this round in hopes that my opponent will have the opportunity to post a response before the end ,1
1494,liberals and nazis both are against religious arguments because their compassionate selfless nature goes against their selfish whims . nazis brainwashed their population into agreeing with their sick ideals using their control of the media . both pathetically attempt to justify their evil mass killings by dehumanizing their targets solely because they do not look the same way they do ,0
1496,where dilation and extraction is performed without inducing partial birth then it has the potential to be just as safe for the mother ,0
1497,these are known as miscarriages and two thirds of human conception is naturally aborted by that process so no sometimes the woman does not have the choice to terminate the fetus and the body does it for them . also you have left one of my arguments uncontested if fetal rights were enshrined in law womens bodies rights and health would be subordinated to the protection of embryos . therefore the argument that you are taking life away from a fetus is completely null unless you can provide facts to prove otherwise . that is not necessarily true sometimes nature aborts the pregnancy before it reaches fetal viability . if you are a young woman which in itself can because many dangerous sometimes life threatening situations ,1
1498,same to you ,0
1499,stop being such a soft weak censored individual and accept death as not only a natural part of life but a necessity in this day and age ,1
1500,you have not even touched this aspect of my argument . it is forming into something so precious that god has given you i never denied it was life . what i did deny was whether the unborn are people ,1
1501,it is true that scientists are still trying to define life but what they do for now is note different characteristics that all living beings have e g growth reaction to stimuli metabolism etc . that does not say anything about the value of the being nor does it mean we can kill them at will . therefore it is impossible to know if a conception will become a human life until the code is completely run and there is a live birth . if every child who has ever came out of a human woman has been human is not it reasonable to understand that every human reproduces a human . however if they are living humans then the is not a good reason to abort because they should be protected like any other human . i can carry this kid to term because I will just get pregnant with another kid and have them both . however as i indicated aborting the child would not bring about a wanted child because most girls women who abort an unwanted child do so because of life situations she wants to go to finish school she wants to get a job etc . if the child is a living human then killing them just because they are unwanted is wrong . i have just shown you an embryologist who says that life begins are fertilization .  even if they could not however that would just be one other advantage a very young human has over an adult human they can also live without a heartbeat . why does the brain matter at all to being a human . if the numbers you quoted are accurate you give no sources so i can not verify your numbers then it seems that life that does implant and develop is special because it has beaten the odds . actually with the development of technologies such as nanotechnology it may be possible to freeze adult humans in the future some organizations already freeze humans who have died in the hopes that they may one day be revived and saved . you would wait and make sure there is not a person that you are aiming at dick cheney notwithstanding . human life has been passed forward without a break in the chain . just because there is some mystery to how dna works does not mean that we can not know that the being is human or has human dna . in the case of rape this still is not a good reason ,0
1502,what if someones religion is that you must have a male be your first born which it is in some cultures . if abortion is illegal than that would contradict the  amendment in the constitution saying that we must have freedom of religion . i also believe that abortion is morally wrong yet we live in a country that secures too many freedoms to take away abortion ,1
1503,coupled with the facts that is it from the h sapiens species and has all human dna there is no valid justification for not considering the embryo to be a human being . my point is that even though death is natural it is not the indispensable means by which society is created nor does it have any special social value . whether sub consciously or consciously the risk has already been taken and the blame is put on the people engaging in the act of coitus . not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights i quote from my opponent the second part of the argument can be dismissed . my opponent tries to dismiss my by saying that a person in a coma already already has legal rights and is not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights . i have also left out the fact that many abortion are taxpayer funded which adds to the economic societal detriment . kinsey showed in  that  to  of all illegal abortions were performed by licensed physicians in good standing . also my opponent has dropped one of my most important points which is that the fetus embryo has all the human dna that will ever be developed in its lifetime . my opponent has completely neglected the part where i previously said that by engaging in the act of coitus the participants are automatically taking up a risk . first of all the point is not whether or not the person who shot the gun was doing it accidentally . just because birth control fails it does not automatically give the women the right to abort . not only does this debate have nothing to do with current legality but just because something is not binding does not make it any less valid . i provided a source which stated otherwise but apparently my opponent automatically thinks that a book source is invalid with no justification whatsoever . also even if the womans life is not threatened but she is somewhat temporarily disabled the killing of the baby is not justified simply because of a temporary disability . he has introduced these so called without any proof of them even existing . death is natural but that whole argument also hinges on pregnancy having special social value and being the precondition to society . you have definitely not proven that the coma argument is invalid ,0
1504,here is where you may object to say that the fetus as a life that will develop into a human has potential for sentience and humanity and the application of laws to it .  specifically I would like to note that i believe the moment the fetus becomes a life is when the fetus brain starts emitting eegs or brain waves which usually occurs between the  and  weeks of pregnancy that is towards the end of the second trimester . as i stand i do not believe there are any legal or ethical dilemmas in abortions in the first and second trimesters and I am content with simply shooting a bush . so then should the rights of the fetus not lie within its stage of development making it a more punishable offense the later stage in its life you abort it . they do not apply to creatures such as cows which are not as intelligent or developed as humans . i see no ethical dilemma in abortion as the development of the fetus is insufficient and the function of the body systems is greatly impaired . i was reluctant to take this debate because the only other one I have had on this site is also on abortion . if that was the case a single human cell or any bacteria spliced with human dna would be identified as human life . the cerebrum the part of the brain that makes the most difference in distinction from animals and in life functioning is the last part of a fetus to develop ,1
1505,that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not . the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply . if there is no significant health or life or very very significant emotional problems which might include rape but since I am focusing on later term pregnancy the mother is losing her rights in that regard given she did not abort when morally grayer aborting the infant in the womb is no different than aborting it when it is born ,0
1506,but I am also againt reductio ad hitlerum which is the new internet term i never knew existed until moments ago meaning that one compares hitler to something as to make it bad . this can be used diagnostically whenever a discussion compares someone else to hitler that discussion is too long and whoever did it has no sense of proportion . reminds me of when gary was talking about taxes . the discussion debate should be ended in favor of the more rational person . one of the reporters asked really technical questions and gary expressed how he did not want to get into the weeds here ,1
1508,i likewise thank you for your time and for a terrific debate ,0
1509,the addition of choice to the possibly that a women got enough to eat in the days before ovulation is rational moral and a necessity in a just society . there is no way to know what fetus responses would be similar to asking anyone how they would respond to a hypostatical they could never encounter . that is anyone may use it regardless of bastardization of the authors intent . what is more interesting to me about the use of this quote is the necessity of the pro life community to manipulate emotion . no one makes the claim that the fetus is intentionally attacking the mother s body but the fetus is doing just that . the fetus is gone and has no ability to wish for a different outcome . personhood is ambiguousunless absolutely necessary within the context of the debate i will not argue over personhood only realize that each side has somewhat conflicting definitions . it was misused from the start and he did not like the meaning getting twisted . first it is understood that the unwanted fetus has no I will intent . before saying that a fetus is an innocent human being is a little backwards . the two you have chosen are of interest to me and are common to the pro life debater . they may have spared pro some trouble but not only do they seem better said now as part of my rebuttal they also may serve pro better now that he or she has had the opportunity to make the argument he wanted . the simple answer for me is it is meaningless ,1
1510,i will be arguing against you for i believe abortion is immoral and unethical ,0
1511,it appears my opponent has forfeited this round ,1
1512,in addition in states with private abortion clinics only in big cities having more government clinics would siphon customers from the private clinics forcing them to expand and offer better services to make themselves stand out from the cookie cutter government solutions . plus the more affordable abortions from an increase in supply would allow poor families to choose not to raise unwanted children which would actually reduce the burden on some poor families as i have clearly explained in the first round . we tell you that this simply cannot happen under our model because it would only lead to the construction of abortion clinics in places where there are few in places already with abortion clinics no new government clinics would actually be built ,1
1513,so when you think about it your committing murder ,0
1514,if people do not want their kids then why do not they put them in foster care or if they do not have the money ask the bank for a loan then work your way up to pay the bank back ,0
1515,yes not all women have friends and family they can turn to but there is bound to be programs to help her . i hear people saying that once there is a heart beat or a brain wave the life is official but says who . a dead person can have a heart beat and brain activity for hours sometimes days after his death does that mean hes still alive . if there is a chance that the being in question is alive more harm would be done by killing it than to let it live . if you are pregnant and your child develops cancer in the womb the longer its in there there is more of a cahnce the cancer spreads to you via blood stream ,0
1516,round one forward ,1
1517,women may have created the body of th baby but god created the soul ,0
1518,examples of extreme late term abortion and mothers who suffer permanent medical complications are not the norm . people are aware that a form of life is being terminated and are not offended enough before the  week to outlaw it . i respect that you do not like the idea of abortion especially in the   weeks I am guessing but many women are just as offended by the idea that it is not their choice ,1
1519,does not that contradict his sentence in the opening statement which says who ever got an abortion or is for abortion should deserve to get killed . I am with allowing the mother to perform abortion as long as the fetus is not conscious yet and the case satisfies one of those conditions  rapeit does not make sense for a mother to raise the child of her rapist . having sex is a lot easier than taking care of a baby and the girl could have performed unsafe sex because of her immaturity to begin  not enough moneyif the baby is going to starve or suffer from malnutrition because of dire economic conditions then i do not see why the mother should keep the fertilized egg . in addition to this it seems that he willingly ignored the part about getting pro choice supporters killed in this round . since he did not provide a clear resolution i decided to argue against that by claiming that abortion should be allowed in some cases and that pro choice supporters should not be killed . even if my opponent believes that abortion should be allowed only in some major cases there is still room for argument on whether abortion should be allowed in the early stages of pregnancy . I am assuming he is against that because that represents the majority of abortion cases ,1
1520,regardless of how anatomically similar it is to a person a fetus could be have more in common mentally with an animal then a mature adult . if spiders where sentient and intelligent it would of course be considered immoral to kill them just like if a human was as intelligent as a spider it would not be considered particularly terrible to kill a person . so in conclusion it is the mental development of a fetus that determines the morality of killing it not the species ,1
1521,the younger a mother is below age  the greater the risk of her infant dying during the first year of life and infants born to teens are   times more likely to have low birth weight than those born to mothers age  or older . if you have an abortion at the right time no harm will come to you or the fetus . according to rainn org there are   victims of sexual assault each year and  of them are under the age of  . if abortion were illegal the doctors could not just request the government let them slide by the law to save this womans life . how your stomach got bigger and bigger how you vomited in the mornings constantly how your feet got swollen and let us not forget the excruciating pain of labor . first and foremost can your body even handle a pregnancy at that age . even if a teen could later put the baby up for adoption the baby would have already been exposed to dangerous conditions ,1
1522,if pro does not want to debate i will take points from full a concession ,0
1525,the decision to have an abortion is extremely private and difficult for most women and there is no place for law there . the decision to have an abortion is much to personal for law to get involved . instead of focusing so much on abortion we should instead focus in better methods of birth control for young teens to reduce the need for abortions ,1
1526,another circumstance would be rape or incest that a woman who is raped and impregnated would be forced to keep the child of the rapist is incredibly immoral and reveals the gender issue behind abortion . argument  l exigent circumstances beyond the mothers health my opponent has only stated the health of the mother as the only because for justifying abortion but this fails to take into consideration other circumstances . in severe cases of this it is likely that the baby dies almost immediately after being born and cannot be ensured any quality of life or conscious experience . a study performed in the  revealed that it was estimated that nearly   women at that time died from complications arising from an illegal abortion . conclusion on these three arguments i make my case that abortion is not immoral for these particular situations . if there is no hope of that person being restored to consciousness we will likely take them off life support as is many times the case . its physical substrate the thalamo cortical complex that provides consciousness with its highly elaborate content begins to be in place between the  and  week of gestation ,1
1527,i accept the challenge thanks for the debate ,1
1528, now i am sure that not to many people are actually aware of the population crises in america or the world for that matter but in spite of the small amounts of media and news coverage the threat is very real . contention  overpopulation i will start out my last contention with a quote by christ hedges who is a former correspondent and author of the article . population projections year projected population percent changefrom population                           now immagine an overpopulated disaster in the you s imagine lands that once could be enjoyed for their natural beauty are now concrete jungles our countrys children attend schools that are overloaded and lack the teacher to student interaction we once had social infrastructures and systems are overloaded natural resources are being depleted and our environment is being tasked beyond its limits . rebutteli will refute my opponents case in the form of four objectections to key problems that my opponent has made and show why these problems hold no water . now my opponent is more then likely state that a fetus is a human and therefore has the right to life and i would agree with him . this omission is odd given that a doubling in population even if we cut back on the use of fossil fuels shut down all our coal burning power plants and build seas of wind turbines will plunge us into an age of extinction and desolation unseen since the end of the mesozoic era  million years ago when the dinosaurs disappeared . so since a fetus is not a person then it has no serious right to life . abortion the termination of a pregnancy after accompanied by resulting in or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus .  by  if we continue to reproduce at the current rate the planet will have between  billion and  billion people . to deny it would be to deny your selves and neither i or my opponent would be in this debate because we would most likely be doing whatever our government told us to do . books and documentaries that deal with the climate crisis including al gores fail to discuss the danger of population growth . the you s has nearly quadrupled the number of people within its boundaries in the past century if our population multiplies by that same amount within the coming century we will hold over one billion people . he sited bible verses and the christian religion as justification for making abortion illegal which is insuffiient because since it is unconstitutional because it violates seperation of church and state ,1
1529,it may harm him temporarily but it will save a life which under a negative utilitarian view is the superior obligation . not only have you done this but you have assumed away the laws of logic by having the second option deny a principle because it would lead to pain otherwise . personhood i would like to contend with everything after  . one five year old vs one hundred one hundred days old embryos once again you have to do the arithmetic .   should not be a test of humanity because it applies to literally almost all other organisms on earth . it is based on the idea that the people against abortion have a double standard . if abortion is murder the two options you present are not the only ones . the number of women with these types of abortions are small . you say that there are endless rows of women who have had abortions during the embryonic stage ,0
1530, before i go on two things need to be cleared up right away  things like will not be brought into this debate ,0
1531,as my opponent stated they will be arguing for why the sentience or lack there of should be how we determine the morality of abortion ,0
1532,i will let the pro start us off ,0
1533,conclusion if this is what you are saying then should not we be aborting almost every kid in africa at this time now that life is difficult to survive there . you have no right in doing anything about the death penalty because you are no on death row . anyone who has or was ever threatened by a gun are the only ones who have the right to defend gun control . this is not really a good reason because no mother gets and abortion because she feels it is necessary to keep the earths population from getting to high . when i see a pregnant woman i do not think she should kill it so she could .  again as said before we have no right to say who lives and who can not . if you can find a doctor who is able to do a legal abortion you can find someone who can take care of the kid . again as said before we have no right in saying who lives and who can not . you have no right in saying the holocaust was wrong because you are not jewish assuming you are not jewish ,0
1534,so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . cons negative utilitarianism the least bad for the most people under cons own moral reasoning there are arguments that can be made in support of allowing early abortion .  mother vs fetus also consider a pregnancy where complications are such that either the woman or fetus can live but not both and fail to act means both die . also consider if such an abortion is viewed as murder the rapist gets convicted of rape but following after is the woman who he raped is now in court because she had such an abortion and thus gets convicted of murder . ironically con cites negative utilitarianism the least bad for the most people as an underlying moral frame work well con in your world we have to always be on guard and in fear of our body being conscripted against our will to save other people and thus i argue is against your own moral framework . also consider that about  of zygotes do not survive to term up to half of all fertilized eggs die and are lost aborted spontaneously often unknown to the pregnant woman .  prevention of suffering of people born into the world with various diseases conditions eg tay sachs edwards syndrome huntingtons alymphocytosis . the argument still is that the human organism in the embryonic period is not a person .  making abortion illegal does not stop them woman who have illegal abortions are at much greater risk of injury and death . cons reasoning if accepted opens up the flood gates where people can have all sorts of things done to their body against their will in the name of saving others lives . maybe con thinks this is wrong because they are assuming that any and all human organisms make it a person because of its humanity i do not think that is tenable for the following reasons . if abortion is murder reducto argument contra con i did not say there are endless rows of women in prison for abortion what i argued for is that if abortion is murder and you are consistent and follow it to it is logical conclusion that is where it gets you . con merely claims it is not unjust but did not explain in detail why vague sweeping notions eg apples and oranges is not a successful refutation of the argument here ,1
1536,my opponent forfeited ,0
1537,not only will the child suffer but society will suffer when that child develops a higher attraction to crime welfare etc ,1
1538,i concede this and hope my opponent will still debate me in the future ,0
1540,my argument is that there is no point in terminating the childs life simplify because the mothers life is in danger by carrying the child to full term ,0
1542,the pain of losing a child may even be worst than the pain of birth . it does matter if the father wants the child . the mom can make choices that are not harmful ,0
1543,why is it wrong to have an abort ,0
1544,sometimes birth control condoms and other things do not work  of the time . she might want to take some time to decide if she wants tow if she really wanted an abortion or if she wants a child . again her birth control might have not worked and she did not figure out until late pregnancy ,1
1545,they had no say in these circumstances and were instead simply given life ,0
1546,give a source for those obviously ridiculous numbers in that study i linked  infants reached orgasm this does not mesh with in the entirety of the world . the sad part is that this poor  year girl that was raped will never have a childhood because her parents were irresponsible enough to allow her to have the child . it is not an unanswerable question the mother has personhood citizenship a name relationships and is not leaching from an umbilical chord ,1
1547,say the violinist is famous but the fact of the matter is that you are keeping this person alive if he is unplugged he will die . having the right to life does not necessarily mean that you have the right to use someone elses body to promote and protect said right to life . i fully understand that abortions due to rape account for a very small percentage of abortions but should not these women have access to a safe procedure that allows them to protect their rights . ultimately the right to life of a fetus does not trump the right to life right to ones body of a mother especially in the case of rape or pregnancy wherein the mothers life is in danger . the important thing to remember is that you were kidnapped and erroneously chosen for this task of keeping the violinist alive you woke up attached to him after all this is meant to be analogous to rape as thompson specifically supports abortion in that instance . it is not about arguing with science because in order to claim that abortion is wrong because a fetus is a living thing you would have to give life some value pushing this debate into the realm of ethics .  you may find it trivial that i used thompsons analogy of a violinist being plugged into ones body to sum up the issues surrounding the right to life in the abortion debate but it is perhaps the easiest way to understand the right to choice side . of course life would have to have value in order to be perceived as more important than the right to ones body . this of course brings to mind the question of the value of a mothers life . this is where the debate tends to get muddy as defining is much more complex than simply defining the activities of cells . thompsons point here is that the right to life argument is not without it is issues i e it is not a black and white ordeal ,1
1548,yes then can be born but then they are alive and no longer part of the mother . yes but the baby is still not alive it is still part of the mothers body and therefore has no rights . as I have said the baby is part of the womans body and so she decides whether or not to have it ,1
1549,at this point this is your position a very small number of abortions occur after the   weeks so the government has the obligation to regulate abortions . not allowing women to consult with professionals when seeking abortion services only poses more of a threat to womens reproductive health . unless you can prove that regulating abortions will result in the immediate halt of all abortions there is no reason that the government should intervene on such decisions . while these laws in some way affect a large part of society only a woman has to deal with the emotional consequences of terminating a pregnancy . denying women access to medical services that enable them to regulate their fertility or terminate a dangerous pregnancy amounts to a refusal to provide health care to women .  of all abortions that take place an insignificant number when you consider my other two arguments regulating abortion does not actually decrease the number of abortions that take place and protecting womens reproductive rights . according to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women discrimination against women includes laws that have either the effect or the purpose of preventing a woman from exercising any of her human rights or fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men . the small number of abortions that take place is outweighed by the fact that these abortions will take place post legislation which guarantees the terminated pregnancy but also threatens the mothers life . to refuse on principle to permit a woman to consider her life or welfare when it seems threatened by pregnancy is to say that only men are the recipients of political freedom and responsibility ,1
1550,the fact that a parent will choose whether or not the child is allowed to continue its growth and life depending and based on gender is  misogynistic .  see this is late on in pregnancy when the child is already developing . the child regardless of gender should be allowed to continue to grow and to live out it is life regardless of their gender ,0
1552,in my side i am saying that abortion should be legalize because you my have seen various disasters which have been taken place because no correct guardian for children if the abortion is not legalize what happen many children become poor some children may not have a good father or a mother ,1
1553,now i also understand the people who have been raped and ended up pregnant and cannot bear to have a child but in the instance of rape and incest proper medical care can ensure that a woman will not get pregnant . there are many options other than abortion that people can do adoption is a viable alternative to abortion and accomplishes the same result . so to be technical there are other options than taking something that could be someones life ,0
1554,the first round is for acceptance ,1
1555,i thank pro for his concession to my position ,0
1557,moreover a girl in dire economic conditions might not even afford to be pregnant so it does not make sense for her to give birth and then give the child away because she is too poor to support it . i do agree that such abortion cases must not be permitted but my opponent never made it clear in the previous rounds that she is arguing against those cases . it seems to me that my opponent shifts goalposts in every round ,1
1558,let us consider some cases that a minor might not want to get permission from her parents ,1
1559,the resolution is as it stands ,1
1561,until my opponent brings up evidence in the contrary you have to flow this argument to my side of the debate . not sure why my opponent is having an issue with the refusal . my opponent has yet to try and prove that abortion is murder or that the fetus is considered to be alive at that point . i shall go over my opponents  arguments in the order he has presented them in . with that my opponent has no arguments left on his side ,1
1562,you can tell because both of the parents are human the chromosomes and dna . i got this from another debate I will comment the name and give credit in the comments later . if you think that this means that my entire point is invalid then just because a baby or fetus cannot reproduce means it has the same worth as a  year old who cannot make babies . lol if your not going to put up an actual debate I will just create another one with somebody else . what distinguishes us from animals plants etc is that the cells are human . a task or act that allows one to meet the demands of the environment and daily life . if you do not want the child then there is something called a d o p t i o n ,0
1563,a parasite desired by many yes but still in definition a parasite and in life and death situations it is the default position to save the mother not the child in a pregnancy . the fact that sex can lead to procreation and the process of a pregnancy being natural does not negate the fact that a woman still has the right to decide what she wants to do with her own body and as far as a responsibility to that life i do not agree especially given the fact under law the moment that baby is born the mother can give that baby to the state and claim no responsibility for the child . being pregnant is not some under the radar event that a woman has to or even should be excepted to do if it is not something she chooses to undergo .  again there is a difference between deciding the fate of your own body and simply going up to another and killing them . they may be healthy but they are in no way able to sustain their own life . as i said earlier that the unborn are healthy and in no way need to die unless you deliberately rip them apart limb by limb and kill them . it could not be helped to breath by any means or any other bodily function ,1
1564,they are barely alive and even if they are alive they do not have the rationality making them part of society and granting them protection . first of all the abortions mostly happen before the foetus are considered fully alive with its organs bodily function etc . usually it is either because they are not ready to have a baby or because the mothers life are in danger . in both scenario biggest benefit are achievable when abortion is done and seeing that i have proven to you that it is justifiable why not . because only when you are rational you can consider yourself a member of society and consent to the idea of having a government over you and join the social contract existing there ,1
1565,they say it is to make partial birth abortion illegal i say if they do not they are just letting everyone see how big of a hypocrite they really are . if a mom murders her  month old baby she goes to jail if a murders a  second old baby she gets away with it there is not difference . partial birth abortion i have been wanting to get in on this argument for a while now this is one thing that i sincerely believe needs to be illegal ,0
1567,imagine that a mother gives her  month old baby a drug so that the baby could not feel pain . but i pro believe we should not punish a innocent baby for what it is father has done . after the mother kills the baby she says that it could not feel pain since it could not feel pain it is nothing wrong with killing the baby . con pointed out that if a woman has been raped she does not have to have the fathers permission to abort . if you believe that the unborn baby is living off the mother you are correct ,0
1568,i think we can agree that a fetus has this quality it is definitely distinguishable from a dead organism . this means that in order for abortion to be a killing a fetus must be alive and this is where the biggest pro choice argument lies . now i do not expect to have any debate over this point either but just in case i have a definition for that too innocent not guilty of a crime or other wrong act m w  . now i know that some people say that a fetus is not alive because it cannot survive outside the womb and yet no one bothers to argue that parasites are not alive . now i do not expect anyone to have a problem with the first premise but where i expect to see some debate is over the second premise that abortion is the killing of an innocent human so that will be what i defend in my first case . i will set up the format for my con constructive case and then i will present my rebuttals to the pro . no one actually defines life to be the ability to survive independently of another organism outside of the issue of abortion we still refer to our organs and parasitic creatures as .  the free dictionary in short life is the quality that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms a pretty reasonable definition . most pro choice arguments rest on the idea that life begins after birth and not conception ,0
1569,for women who demand complete control of their body control should include preventing the risk of unwanted pregnancy through the responsible use of contraception or if that is not possible through abstinence . but to kill one of our own species is not the natural order . no civilized society permits one human to intentionally harm or take the life of another human without punishment and abortion is no different . since life begins at conception abortion is akin to murder as it is the act of taking human life . those who choose abortions are often minors or young women with insufficient life experience to understand fully what they are doing ,0
1570,my point exactly ,0
1571,people have the right to have sex and sex does not always lead to a child and with modern technology of birth control and other forms of contraceptives it is not something that even has to be a part of the equation . you dons body should not be used as a life support system against her will any more then we should rip out a person s liver to give it to someone who needs it to stay alive . and no women should be forced to carry a pregnancy to term if she does not want it . it s not a matter of a burden or not you have no right no matter your size or need to use my body for anything unless i give permission . it is natural to eat but even through eating you run the risk of getting a parasite and ultimately that is what a baby is . what i am talking about with weather a person wants to live or not is that do we even have the right to bring life into this world at all . there is a difference between us and the unborn with or without assistance i can live unlike a new born who can t ,1
1572,in fact there are people i know who have had abortions and i do not love them any less for it but when it comes right down to it it is still murder and weather you accept it or not it will not change the facts .  I would like to restate the fact that i hate abortion but if a woman was contemplating it then she should at least consult her partner first it would be messdup not to . though i am not christian i respect and honor the christian beliefs and though i may not agree with all the catholic beliefs i do believe that abortion is wrong murder and whatever else you would like th call it but one thing is for sure it is not right . that is like you and your girlfriend both bought a kitten together and she one day decides that she does not want it and kills it . i mean come on what the hell would france be without the maid of lorane now do not get me wrong because i know I am kinda pushin the envelope a bit but you can understand my point right . i believe its the womens choice to have a baby and abortion is not murder first of all I would like to state that it is not the right or desicion of the parents to decide wheather or not the the child of another lives or dies wheather that person is their child or not . though i can never imagine the feeling that a pregnant woman has i can imagine its not that pleasant but I am more then sure that there are women who have been raped but still had their child . abortion is something that only people of the  and  century have known but sexual assult has been going on forever . rather then boil a culdron full of water once a month we can just hop in the shower every night and rather then have our children like real men and women like our ansestors we can just abort them . now this is a pretty f dup scenario but that still does not make abortion right . the only reason we can not handle things like this today is because we do not have to ,0
1573, provided that semantics are common on this site i will provide a list of rules to prevent anyone from twisting this debate to their advantage . it is implied that women who get abortions during their first trimester or use birth control to prevent pregnancy are not selfish . sorry i could not put spaces in between certain words in my resolution . i meant to put on my other debate too but i did not because there was not enough space to do so . i actually got to know the user better and it turns out he she is not that bad of a guy girl ,0
1574, abortion kills babies  abortion is just an easy way out for an irresponsible woman who does not want to deal with having a child .  if you do not want to have a baby use birth control .  the government should not cover up for your personal mistakes ,0
1575,i suggest that one or more of you vote the s g point and specifically point out that she could boldface quoted material or start the first line of quoted material with a colon or otherwise take pains to distinguish quoted material from new material . what i think it means my best and most charitable interpretation is that it means the sperm cell is not a person . let us say pro is saying that after three months if we leave the poc alone and let it develop in a natural way it may eventually with some luck get born . a better solution not good but far less damaging than that proposed by pro would be to let certified infertile women choose one single fertile woman and get a court order forcing her to have children and then surrender them .  not all women are comfortable with fertility treatments and would rather just adopt a baby they can raise as their own . I have raised this personhood issue myself and pro seems to be agreeing that it is important but she is not tying it to her arbitrary three month limit . and even if we were going to abuse ourselves and our society by pretending that such things do have rights this would have nothing to do with pros arbitrary three month limit .  while pros arbitrary three month rule serves no purpose that she cares to name it would do enormous harm to individual lives and to american freedom . there is no reason for us to impute opinions to them like or or . but it is okay there is no problem with it because they do not have any opinions . this test fails to draw a line at three months it produces cells at a mass rate . even pro is okay with killing pocs before three months . it is true even of an egg and sperm cell in a womb together . none of them would support her arbitrary three month limit even if they did survive inspection . not all women are comfortable with being forced to have babies for other women they would rather not have children at all or not have children until they want them for themselve . since her s g is worse than mine voting s g points is permissible . but presumably science will eventually fix that so even a baby that has to be taken from the womb at one month can survive . pro has conceded that the resolution is false . but even if you want to count that mention without link as a source she did not use that source in a way that helped her case . the various rationales one way you can recognize when you are in the wrong is this if you find yourself flailing around grasping and abandoning one rationale after another then you probably do not have a real justification for your position . there is no point no utility to pretending they do ,1
1576,human and not jewishhuman and conscioussee how good we are at creating reasons that permit us to enslave dominate and kill some particular group by not recognizing the obvious fact that they are as equally human as the rest of us .  in fact pro goes on to state that mowing the grass is morally equivalent or perhaps worse than killing a human zygote the most elementary stage of human life . I have shown that his arguments are based on appeals to emotion and a denial of rights through discrimination based on size and development of the unborn . this is not something that happens by accident or randomly but rather is the normative developmental trajectory of humans . sometimes right sometimes wrongpro questions why i bothered to fully refute his argument stating i refuted it because it was faulty logic and he has to show that there are both times that it is and is not permissible . conclusionpro has failed to substantiate either side of his argument . so the argument is that if you have had a bad accident or will suffer a brain aneurysm in the next  hours we can just rescind your rights and kill you on the spot . that is because he introduced almost no new arguments but instead tried to give analogies that showed that the unborn were not humans before a certain age . i had noted in the previous round that rationality is something that develops from within the organism and not something that is implanted by the mother or some other agent . this is because we have a rational nature unlike trees do not have rational natures because trees do not naturally express rationality my apologies to any ents reading this discussion . i believe that i can confidently state that we humans are rational creatures . if you live to a  are president and have grand kids do you have any greater right to life that the child that may only live an hour outside of its mothers womb . we do not have a right to a particular outcome but what we do have as human beings are fundamental human rights . is life itself and its meaning a mystery that each of us get for our time we are alive whether long and glorious or short and feeble . additionally i gave sound reasoning as to why humans have a rational nature thus showing them to be persons right from fertilization . rebuttalsi must admit that pro is mostly correct when he said that the majority of my rebuttals from the last round were refuting points he had made in the first round . as such this argument has been completely substantiated and shows that every human has inalienable rights ,0
1577,so the objection that the women does not want the child to be a part of her life is no excuse and nor does it justify killing it .  since the the women does not want that child to be a part of her life in the first place having it may result in abuse of child emotionally physically and possibly sexually . if the biological parents want nothing to do with their offspring there are families all over the nation waiting desperately to adopt a baby families who are willing to adopt diseased babies of any race or ethnicity . even if the women does not want the child to be a part of her life she does not need to kill it . and even if she still does not change her mind and still does not want the child to be a part of her life that does not justify killing it and depriving it of our very natural and important right ,0
1578, a more clear example is within the us constitution with the  amendment which states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the united states is also part of a larger coalition of countries known as the united nations therefore abides or at least should abide by protecting human rights as they define it . even pro abortion advocates like the new scientist concede that a human zygote is a human being the task force finds that the new recombinant dna technologies indisputably prove that the unborn child is a whole human being from the moment of fertilization that all abortions terminate the life of a human being and that the unborn child is a separate human patient under the care of modern medicine . with this data a huge vast majority of pregnancies are the result of consensual sex .  sub argument  human rights as stated above apply to unborn babies as stated in the united nations declaration of human rights there is no distinction between human being and a person as within article vi everyone has the right to be recognized as a person before law .  we also know that the each zygote is a distinctive human being because their dna is distinctive from either parent .  million pregnancies every year which makes up about less than half of a percent . if you give a cop without a permit permission to enter your house and he she finds incriminating evidence to be used at your trial the  amendment cannot be used to help you . as human beings under such entities they are entitled to inalienable rights such as the right to life . even if the right to privacy and bodily autonomy overrides the right to life somehow in most cases it cannot be used in most cases of abortion . to begin with stated within the united states declaration of independance we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness .  however as established before the unborn baby is due for protection under the law including the right to life . below is an exert from an embryology textbook the development of a human being begins with fertilization a process by which two highly specialized cells the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism the zygote . there is no objective reason why these criteria should be imposed in deciding what is human and what is not human ,0
1579,adoption homes would be closed if they did not have enough money or they would not accept children ,0
1580,so if you want to have sex then you will have to deal with the consequences ,0
1581,abortion should be illegal for so many reasons first you are killing a human a baby that can not defend himself and do not tell me is not a human or alive because a baby heart starts pumping in the fist weeks ,0
1582,rapist will force the victim to take abortion pill after raping her so that the victim have no physical evidence that he did rape her ,0
1583,iia dolphins and bonobos are among a few animal species i do believe should be protected by stricter laws as they have exhibited a higher level of intelligence than other animals . even if a cell is not separated from a person we do not have laws to protect every individual cell composing a body . I would like to point that i do not believe it is a condition to live in because of the mental capacity of the person . regardless of whether or not the child is not more intelligent because he she is not developed enough to be or simply just has not been exposed to or taught enough the fact remains that humans have a much higher capability for knowledge than dolphins . while they may not classify as human they share the same genetic code so you can see why applying laws based on genetics is flawed ,1
1584,question if ou would abort it why did you even have it in the first place . its wrong its evil and its against the laiw . they will have a life and you just ruined it for them . its just killing the person before he she is born . it is a human being not a it ,0
1585, dolores o riordan to start this one off I will mention that while dolores is not judging women that plan to have or have had an abortion she is very biased and maybe uneducated in her argument . instead the quote delves into the microscopic level of reality my words not what was actually meant to be implied in dr seuss book horton hears a who . this should stay true until that living thing effects another living in a negative way like how a girl of your age would not be prepared alone to bear a child . even though some women say oh i do not mind to have one every time a woman has an abortion it just crushes her self esteem smaller and smaller and smaller . i try to make everything i say as clear and unbiased as i can please tell me if you find something unclear opinionated in my writing . what baffles me is the lack of understanding that one life is not the most important issue . but even then it does not matter that a person is a person no matter how small . abortion is entirely a womens choice which is one of the reasons why people around the world fight for the right to get an abortion to have a choice between having a child or not . this basically meaning that what she says about other women what they feel how they must feel after getting an abortion is not necessarily true . what dolores says about abortions not being healthy is false and the statement seems to be fabricated from her own assumptions judging by her wording . a zygote is not sentient nor is it coherent and it is so dependent and connected it is for lack of better words carrier that it responds to the human brain directly much how you can move your arm with your mind but can not move a babys arm with your mind as it is a separate entity . a fetus never would have never known it lived in the first place and as it were being killed it would not protest in some form against it . adoption is very black and white with the children that are up for it ,1
1586,poor woman are most susceptible to circumstances in which abortion is necessary ,1
1587,pro gives no response to my arguments ,1
1588,while you are reading this a child is dying because of an adults ignorance .  of all abortions occurs between   weeks gestation . nathans an early proponent became a pro life campaigner after he saw a  week old fetus scream during an abortion . abortion is a sad cruel way to end a babys life . i feel like abortion is the most horrific way to hurt a child ,1
1589,i have the burden of presumption which is too assume that the status quo right now is working and i believe that giving soon to be mothers the choice of an abortion is good it is a free country after and the separation of state and church prevents you from placing your religion based opinion on a matter that affects an entire nation . thousands of children are in orphanages and adoption agencies the chances of every child ever being adopted by a good family are extremely low and the chances are diminished further when you put in the fact that more children are created than are adults to take care of them . you should have the option to do whatever you like and other than the fact that the affirmative is clinging on the fact that i he loses on all other arguments and therefore if he cannot prove his case the vote should go to the negative in this debate ,1
1590,before  weeks a foetus does not feel pain is not conscious of itself or its surroundings . is terminating a foetus which can neither feel nor think and is not conscious of its own existence really commensurable with the killing of a person . until a fetus can survive on its own it cannot be called a life any more than the acorn can be called a tree ,1
1591,finally you have no philosophical reasoning for demonstrating why it should matter that killing babies is wrong just because they are cute does not necessarily mean they are persons . the fallacy here is similar to the argument from silence which states that just because someone has not responded to an argument or claim does not mean that argument claim is true . a person is a morally and legally relevant entity and the question becomes whether or not a fetus is a person . this is obviously a debatable point so I will leave further discussion for the next round seeing as we have  rounds . if you want to defend the doctrine that sentient beings are persons then go ahead but in my second round I will be sure to pounce on that . even then saying you have a big hotshot name supporting a certain belief gives you little if any credit for proving that belief . it is not a constitutional or a scientific problem though these disciplines are intertwined with answering the issue of abortion but rather a philosophical one what determines personhood ,1
1592,my point is that even though abortion is always immoral because there is sound reasoning behind allowing abortions for medical reasons we can not construct a law that would be enforceable or not jeopardize the people the exemption is intended for . this presents a conflict for a doctor because they know that they will be in legal jeopardy even when they know that they are correct . the con maybe surprised to see that we actually agree on many of the moral grounds . if you are faced with both dieing or only the child dieing then you go with the only option where someone can live . if we assume guilt in any abortion case then we require that the defence proves that the abortion was medically necessary . this is not because either is dishonest but because medical expertise and option varies widely and is why you should always consider getting a second opinion . such arbitrary lines are only used to comfort us when we are faced with such morally destructive decisions like abortion and to avoid legal vagueness . it may seem logically irrational to be pro choice and hold such an objective moral view but i assure you that my view is entirely based on reason . normally i would have to argue for either rape or the health of the mother as situations where abortion is permissible before going further but since the con has kindly yielded the health of the mother i will build upon that point ,1
1593,you are sexy ,1
1594,better yet think about it before you lay your head down tonight . but i believe that above all if you are not willing to have a child do one of the two a use a condom . people find it ok do do a sick thing killing children before they are even born ,0
1595,voters what is more moral a safe abortion that takes place at a time where the fetus is not a human being can not feel pain and is not conscious or having thousands of babies die painful deaths . so in conclusion things pro needs to answer at what stage does it become murder to kill a fetus . pro makes the same gigantic assumption that i have that the fetus is not alive and feels no pain and has no intrinsic value as pro stated without verbal reports and direct access to the mind of a fetus inferences about what fetuses are able to experience depends on the interpretation of secondary evidence . once that signal gets into the brain the information is transmitted through a complex web of neurons to an area of the brain called the cortex she said . the nervous system of a fetus is not developed enough to the point where it can feel pain until around the  week of pregnancy . therefore my original argument stands since fetuses can not feel pain until the  trimester it is morally just to abort a fetus before that point to save the fetus mother and family of pain after birth . pro asks con for evidence on why fetus equals human life well i assume pro was once a fetus and never stopped being human offspring and has just grown a bit . rebuttals the sources of my adoption argument were a bit off and i concede that when i did more digging into the matter and found the numbers a bit different . pros main point throughout the debate was that since fetuses can not feel pain and are not human beings it is morally just to abort them in order to stop pain after birth . when a person is injured say you stub your toe for example a signal travels from the foot up through the nerves in the leg to the spinal cord and then from spinal cord up to the brain davis said . while i concede this point adoption is an option and should be considered way before abortion especially if you can not afford the child . instead of attacking the idea that abortion before a fetus is able to feel pain is moral con has instead focused in on what specific week fetuses can feel pain . con stated the bottom link was the most informative . is it when the mother wants to give birth if not is it worthless there needs to be a clear line drawn by pro . con has not actually proved that a fetus is a human being merely claiming that because since fetuses grow into human beings they are human beings ,1
1596,allowing abortion deprives the world of the very knowledge and ability that child could have brought it . what ever that child could have done for the world is gone . abortion should be murderwhat would be the difference between someone having an abortion and someone killing a child that is fully developed ,0
1597,because my opponent has forfeited this round i thin that it is obvious that if the man is not the who is going to have to carry and take care of the bay there is no reason that he should have the final say in whether they have the abortion or not ,1
1598, where did you get this information con . it looks like con is refusing to debate the majority of my argument which makes me quite sad but being a good sport i will be more then happy to debate her arguments against abortion . second a fetus is not a child and third if abortions were the reason men went around impregnating women then why do all the ones paying child support to  different children continue to put woman in that same situation .  let us begin by looking at cons quote from mother teresa which says by abortion the mother does not learn to love but kills her own child to solve her problems .  it can not be murder because you can not kill what has not even been born ,1
1599,my opponent forfeited this round if you are planning on voting you know what to do ,1
1600,i believe they are trying to say that the constitution only consists of guidlines though this may be true we can not completely disregard the amendments particularly those that give rights to the individuals and to the states . it is the duty of the american government to follow the established by the constitution and allow that states to decide whether or not abortion is legal . and as a point of clarification i did not say that my opponent had integrated bias people but that they were bias themselves ,1
1601,statistically speaking hardly any of the abortions committed had anything at all to do with her life being in danger or because of rape less than  are because of rape or incest . after all we are talking about more than  percent of them who fall into this category . tells a woman what she can or cannot do with her body all the time ,0
1602,not a problem ,1
1603,secondly a poll commissioned in  for the telegraph showed that  of members interviewed were in favour of the limit being reduced to  weeks from  week pdfs  march sunday telegraph abortion survey ,0
1604,if a woman is a single woman and the father is not around that child can absolutely have a great life are you that blind . of course not it is alive and the same damn thing . you can put sources down all you want but at the end of the day the vast majority of woman wish they never had an abortion and it haunts them . if you do not believe in a god that is your choice . so you are basically telling me at any point during pregnancy a woman has the choice because it is her womb and her body . that being said you are ignorant again of the fact that at  weeks a child has brain waves and a faint heart beat . if you had an abortion at  months yourself you are telling me that you did not end a life .  months  months or up until the day it leaves the womans body . if you can not do that then that is a irresponsible decision ,0
1605,and you did not address the hypothetical of an accident being caused by someone where the other is attached to you and you can not separate the people for a few months . con would make it an issue of semantics an say everyone has equal rights . no one would say it is okay for the person who caused the accident to kill the victim . so it is okay to terminate a week before her due date just because she wants to and not for exceptions like health of the mother . are societys rights prioritized when they say a smoker can not smoke in public places ,0
1606,again my opponent has failed to produce any arguments to defend his her point ,0
1607,the first round will only be for acceptance and small introductions ,0
1608,should a woman or young girl who is raped have to live with the consequences and reminder of what has happened for the rest of her life . if a woman suffers an unforeseen circumstance that she has no control over she should have the option of help from the government should there be any in place . it all boils down to personal choice whether an abortion should even be committed but at the end of the day money is being used in various branches of the economy that not everyone agrees to such as the death penalty housing inmates nuclear bombs and military service ,1
1609,i think that abortion should be available only when it is a case of rape or incest or if the mothers life is threatened and only then ,0
1610,what makes since giving a unborn childa chance at life or just wasting the time to even think about it ,0
1611,the person who is murdered could have had so much potential and could do so many things in his life and murder is essentially robbing him of his future . if the fetus is less than  months old it is incapable of feeling pain and will not have to endure pain or suffering during the procedure . considering that more than  of abortions occur before the fetus is  months old i think the pain that the fetus endures is irrelevant when discussing abortion . first of all in some cases killing in some cases would be considered wrong due to the amount of pain it causes a point which pro raised . if you think that murder is wrong because it denies an individuals potential or future then many other things are punishable ,1
1612,ok let us stick to the argument at hand the question is not whether or not i should have engaged in sexual activity ,1
1613,adopting is not always a smart idea statistics show that a number of children that are adopted become destructive mentally . a fetus does not become human until the  or  week . it is no different that stepping on a spider or cutting down a tree ,1
1615,oh no a forfeit ,1
1616,the only thing the government should do is make sure the abortion is safe for the woman . if a pregnant woman does not want to have a child than she could either have an abortion or put the baby up for adoption once it is born . when a woman gets raped the government should pay for her to have an abortion because she should not have to pay for someone doing something terrible . why should the woman get a consequence for her mistake by having a child when she does not want to . i believe it is the right choice for a woman to have an abortion in cases of rape incest or if the life of the woman is danger . so you can not say that fetuses do not want to get killed because they do not want anything . i do not believe the government should forbid women from having an abortion in any cases ,1
