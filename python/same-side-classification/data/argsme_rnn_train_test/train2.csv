1,however my opponent has not shown the idea that government control causes stagnation to be a general fact nor has con shown that government control of abortion specifically would because stagnation or a diminishing of quality con simply provided examples of failed governmental projects from countries like yugoslavia and east germany both of which were communist states that by no means resemble the united states . conclusiontoday we have had an opponent who has failed to prove that his solution of letting the free market manage abortion would be superior to a government funded solution .  in addition when we build government clinics in places with fewer clinics we because private businesses to also expand into these areas to capture the sales that the government is siphoning from their existing places . in countries like britain the nhs uses less money than its private counterparts but still maintains a similar standard of care showing that government controlled services could work out very well . some people disagree with funding the military because they think it is immoral to fund wars ,1
2,by saying the right to life does not apply to babies outside of the you s implying only american fetuses are relevant my opponent is discrediting the argument that all fetuses have the right to life . pros argument is that back alley abortions would not be a problem because before the supreme court case more than  of the illegal abortions were done by medical professionals with high standing in their fields . in the last round i explained at length why a particular level of sentience and capacity for sentience should be the standard for legal personhood . i went on to explain that abortion should be a legal choice for women because it is risky and directly involves their body and health . so he is saying that medical professionals are thankfully willing to perform the procedure instead of having some hack do it . second the reason there have been few deaths from illegal abortions is because abortion is available thanks to abortion doctors and people willing to do the procedure . however my argument is not that we should make abortion legal simply because people will do it anyway it is that it makes no sense whatsoever to make women criminals for  not violating another persons rights and  because forcing unsafe abortion kills both fetus and woman making it a nonsensical standard . throughout the next  years until abortion became legal the same number of women each year over  million in some years continued to seek abortions out illegally . so pro must not only prove that fetuses have the right to life but that this right means they can violate other peoples bodies against their will in order to keep living . pro counters that fetuses have that right as well however that is a bare assertion since i am specifically arguing that they do not . pro says non fetus stem cells exist but that is irrelevant . essentially there is no way pro can argue that back alley abortions are not unsafe or problematic . if the law does not legally permit us to sell our own organs the law cannot claim to have more control over how our bodies are used than we do . i argued that other people do not have the moral or legal authority to govern our bodies even if someone elses life is on the line . however the push to criminalize abortion and not those who need fertility treatment proves the contention is less about protecting human lives and more about controlling womens bodies . throughout this debate I have been arguing that it is more pragmatic to keep abortion legal as well as moral because fetuses do not have the right to life . research by legal scholar shauna prewitt indicates that the resulting continued contact with the rapist is damaging for women who keep the child which is possible because  states in the you s allow rapists to assert custody and visitation rights over children conceived through rape ,1
3,as far as health i am not advocating putting an unborn fetus to death because it would be born handicapped but physical and mental abnormalities do not only effect the child the effect the mother as well . if you are pregnant and your child develops cancer in the womb the longer its in there there is more of a cahnce the cancer spreads to you via blood stream . a dead person can have a heart beat and brain activity for hours sometimes days after his death does that mean hes still alive ,1
4,i will let my opponent make his arguments in the first round ,0
5,use this round to wrap up your argument and close it no semanticssources may be posted in the comments sectionthere will be an equal burden of proofpro must fulfill his burden of proof and argue why it is morally permissible as well as defeat cons objections and argumentcon must fulfill his burden of proof and defeat pros argument as well as give an argument that shows why it is not morally permissible and defend it from objections ,0
6,with this significant scientific disagreement i believe that until more substantial proof supports the  week limit we should to be safe make the limit at  weeks . i believe it is wrong to kill an adult human because they are a being with interests . i expect we also agree that a newborn baby has the same value as an adult human . at least until we have proof beyond reasonable doubt that fetuses feel pain we should set the abortion limit at  weeks . it seems that the best place to draw the line is when the fetus goes from not having the same value as an adult human to having it . if pregnancy lasted only  weeks potentially not enough time to make the decision then would it be right to kill the newborn . i could argue that  weeks is enough time to make a decision but i believe this is unnecessary unless you can prove otherwise ,0
7,i know there are rape children that are alive and living perfectly fine i just brought it up as a small point nothing too relevant . it would be a very emotionally bad experience for her and she can not even do anything about it abortion is illegal . i understand that going around killing people with disorders is very bad but abortion is different as i have explained .  this prevalence translates into an estimated case fatality rate of  deaths per   unsafe abortions which is hundreds of times higher than that for safe legal abortion in developed nations . anyhows discussing the realitivity of morals is another debate as this debate is focused on abortion . philocat can argue his points but he will never even truley understand what it is like to be pregnany pre maturely . because of natural selection failing to work humans should take on the course of improving the genepool in non cruel ways . a young term embryo fetus shows little to no signs of brain activity they do not have a consciousness . morals are just a made up concept in your head nothing else . it is also cruel to risk a womans health possibly life because they disagree with one on abortion . while on a topic like abortion relying on biased sources for arguments is not bad . if a young teenage girl was suffering from pregnancy and writing this she could go in much more depth and detail than i ever could . worldwide an estimated   women die as a result of complications from unsafe induced abortions every year about eight per hour . consciousnessa fetus embryo that is not conscious and far from being a developed human is relevant to be gotten rid of in some cases . more importantly a teenage has a history of consciousness ,1
8,like i said they could give the baby away ,0
9,you find out the worst your birth control failed and now you are in the very very early stages of pregnancy . imagine the pain and suffering you would be forced through not to mention the danger births resulting in the death of the mother are still not uncommon against your will . if pro had his way this complete stranger would suddenly be able to destroy your right to an abortion simply because it was his sperm that got lucky enough to reach an egg ,1
10,but above all the fundamental reason sribs expresses his opinion this way in his opening argument is because he wants to inflict her morals upon the different people around her . what i believe my opponent was trying to say though was that the forced termination of human life is . he maintains that because killing is therefore abortion is also wrong . in other words if at any time in your life you were not procreating you just destroyed potential life . who are we to expect pregnant women to voluntarily donate their body and life support systems to something else . but even if a fetus were a human being its still would not trump the rights of the mother . if we can assume that preventing life to become life is in fact killing then every moment you are not engaging in the act of reproduction you are killing potential life ,1
11,also when you state is the negative affect of the rape . she could experience those physcological problems on top of the ones she could be having from pas . i mean sure the child would be heart broken but since he she was born proves that his mother cared about s he ,0
13,i see that but if they are not ready then they could use condoms spermacide and even birth control . there are many mothers that want a baby but can not have one and there are mothers who are whores and can have them but are to lazy to fill out the paper work to give it up for adoption so they just kill the baby . they could have prevented the baby they were just stupid and did not think about the consequence of their actions just like little kids ,0
14,here in lies the inherent contradiction that you have failed to address and side stepped by dismissing it as irrelevant when it is if the woman aborts it is the only case that is not considered murder . so as the i am the in this debate i am respectfully asking to see what the laws of australia in terms of abortion and what the punishment is for someone who kills the baby of a pregnant woman . elizabith wilkes examining the marital laws in ny state in  she has all the rights of income and property as if she were unmarried excepting marriage . the issue as to why abortions are evil is based on the fact that killing a human is murder . but we have this law called the right to life and i do not think we should make accpetions or give power to any individual to decided who is worthy of being a human and who is not in our society . if a man deliberately hits a woman in the stomach surprisingly it fits the definition thus it would be applicable to argue this point .  my opponent stated that only under the law he had provided does killing a fetus is considered as killing . your argument is not it is about protecting the life of the child . it is all wrong and there should be no acceptions . furthermore we have the ability to look beyond the laws of our countries and turn to science for some objectivity since I have proven that the laws are hypocritical on this subject . the reason why abortion is wrong is because the baby is not seen as a living human even though science agrees that it is a living human . here is the truth this website properly cites scientific studies conclusions  no matter what the condition of the mother is the child is innocent and does not deserve to die . since the child is a living being as i have proven abortion is therefore murder ,1
15, the main difference between successful western countries and oriental despotisms is the rule of law with a clear boundary between legal and illegal ,1
16,i need help ,0
17,well like my previous statement ,0
18,google com a fetus is simply an unborn baby or an unborn human ,0
19,no child was asked to be brought into this world and to deny they safty in the own mothers wombs seems like the greatest violation of rights out there . if we follow your premise that all humans also have a right to use their own bodies how they please why does not this apply to the unborn . i think if we come to see as modern science has that the unborn are infact unique human life then to deny one set of humans rights of personhood let us them become disposable ,0
20,you have been very vague in your posting so i will refute your only standing point with the following conclusion i drew you have to look at each individual ,1
21,babies are being torn to pieces stabbed in the heart with a poison needle or suffocated in the name of choice ,0
22,it confers lower rights on the unborn . but this assigns rights arbitrarily to the unborn as compared to an ordinarily conceived child . the solution though cannot be to ban abortions even in cases of rape ,1
23,I am sure it would ,1
24,resolved the practice of abortion ought to be made illegalabortion the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy ,0
25,what numbers exist show that the demographic most likely to have a late term abortion are girls under  years of age cdc what evidence do you provide that increasing regulation would decrease the number of abortions anyway . i find it hard to believe of all abortions are in countries where the procedure is illegal guttmacher et al . there is dispute that it can be called murder especially when you have not defined murder with respect to non human entities ,1
26,i really do not understand how we can not all agree to disagree on what we should value as life but continue to work together to solve the problem that arises from this disagreement ,1
27,if a dream idea or who you are dies inside is the greatest loss then a actual human being dieing inside a person has got to be the greatest loss of all . grown people who have lived a life and is face with a choice of how they should die is one thing and a person who never breathed a breath of life never having a choice at all are two different things . in abortion it is not just quick and easy and it is over with the baby really experiences all of what happens to it and it is very sad . i agree being abandoned is a very sad thing to endure but living a decent life will help that condition and one can still have a prosperous life . but the killers in heart had a appointment of death with innocent people that day thinking they were doing something good and made some of victims make a horrible choice . a study shows that the biggest stresses in life are death divorce and moving . one big difference once that condition has accrued there is no life and the girl or woman will have to deal with the guilt of abandoning their morals and killing her child therefore life will be filled with shame and hurt . may god forgive us for the she would of innocent blood . it is better that you find out those are not your parents and live than your parents killing you and die ,0
29,and for something to be a law it must be enforced . since my opponent did not offer a definition of a law i thought it would be prudent to do so . the principles and regulations established in a community by some authority and applicable to its people whether in the form of legislation or of custom and policies recognized and enforced by judicial decision ,1
30,there is a numeric value to human life . this is why the ceo and the vice president of large corporations always travel in separate airplanes . it is measured in dollars ,1
31,if pro holds that it is necessary to merely possess these characteristics in any form then many animals e g pigs would have to be considered as persons morally equivalent to humans . pro attacks this saying claiming both that such cases still exhibit some of warren s criteria and that using sentience dissolves this problem . given i agreed that pro s cultured aliens would be persons for the same reason I am astounded by pro s claim . if this is this the threshold pro holds consider this self initiated activity is already present at   weeks when human beings in utero begin to suck their thumbs and move about . i have admitted this charge without regarding the admission as fatal to my position  while neither singer nor pro advocate infanticide this is only because they are living inconsistently with their own ethical judgement . this self serving conception still even can not cover the disabled and the temporarily comatose while excluding the unborn as warren herself admits  . the category that is morally central to this analysis is the category of having a valuable future like ours it is not the category of personhood . in order to deal with hard cases pro has to continually readjusting the bar on each of the criteria . as such that you exist and are currently actualising an embryos flo proves embryos have a flo . pro did not respond to either of these so I will take it we both agree that the unborn are human beings . pro s examples of bananas and sperm fail because they are not de facto rational agents . he then claims the substance view is arbitrary and leads to specieism . the organism that grew to become adult you exists after only fertilisation . i already anticipated this in my last round using examples of a temporary coma patient and a suicidal teenager . in response to my coma patient example pro holds that exhibiting a semblance of self motivated activity is enough . he gave no justification of warren s criteria at all beyond identifying them . undermining human equality here i argued that as pro is basing rights on intellectual capacities these rights should differ according to these capacities ,0
32,so if a woman is forced to give birth to an unwanted fetus then she would not likely be able to become pregnant with a mate of her choice for at least  months . so by forcing birth and denying them the opportunity to become pregnant for  months with their lovers child con would be denying life for at least that long plus the time it takes to conceive . and during that  months she would be forced to give birth to an unwanted fetus and the life of a child of her choice would be denied . the reason saving the wanted fetus is the least harmful path is because we know for certain that there will likely be a wanted birth and there is little chance that an unwanted conception will be born . it is a common stated belief of the pro life community that if we are not certain if something is in fact life then we should take the least harmful path . this is the issue to be debated if a woman is forced to carry to term one fetus then she cannot normally become pregnant with another fetus in the same time period . of course if that is true then she probably does not want to be pregnant with the unwanted child either . likewise cons second point fails in that the as presented makes it clear that forcing the birth of one child stops the potential of another child . and most women throughout history have been able to find a mate and have children when they want all of cons points fail . she may be forced to go on public assistance and thousands of other reasons that will because her to fail to have a child of her choice . the changes everything prior to the law it was unclear that a life was being traded for a life . the fact that a woman has never been able to become pregnant with a second child while already pregnant with another child does not mean that the does not exist . so the sensible thing to do is to save the wanted fetus and not let it be killed in the process of saving of the unwanted fetus . even if cons point that it is not a real life is taken as true and it is not true the fact is that the option of a real life being denied creation is still a fact . if con can prove that all women are lying when they say they want a child by their lover and not their rapist he may have a point ,1
33,by carrying the child of their rapist a woman not only is traumatized in the act itself but every single day for the subsequent  weeks . if we can know with reasonable certainty that the childs quality of life would be short and horrible then i see no moral reason not to save it from that fate .  in cases of severe genetic or developmental deformities to save the child from sufferingif it is determined that the child would only live a short time and would experience severe pain and suffering outside the womb then it is humane to abort the fetus before its full term to save it from this suffering ,1
34,I am not here to debate something i did not sign up for ,1
35,granted the media is not the most reliable source as often it depends on which form of news media as well as the fact that it can be biased and ignore certain news in favour of others but you see rape a lot more than premature sex you also hear about it more . initially premature sex does not have much to do with abortion premature sex would mainly be the issue of whether sexual education should be given out at young ages to teach children about that sort of thing . out of all the rape cases I have read about i have never seen one where a rapist forces the victim to take an abortion pill . you are saying that rather than teach the rapist not to rape you would rather force the woman through childbirth painful labour and if your premature arguments are worth anything extremely painful labour as the undeveloped children that do have sex will have to give birth using their own bodies of which all would not be ready for such a streinuous effort as childbirth and force them to then hand the baby over to the government and move on . will every single rapist and judging by the rape culture that we are hopefully fighting there is quite a few rapists force their victim to take an abortion pill ,1
36,i think that it is twisted and sick to murder an unborn child who has no say in whether or not they get the chance to enjoy life . it would not be impossible to find alternate solutions to ending this life that has already begun if the choice is not to keep the child . i look forward to hearing from someone who has a different take on this particular subject ,0
37,let us take a look at the bear scenario my opponent gave in  where one man mistakes a person for a bear thus shooting him and killing him accidentally . about my nyt source please note that the who did a research in countries where abortion is illegal where they found out that  million unsafe abortions are performed per year  of those women die and between   million of these risky abortions result in long term damage or illnesses . in a utilitarianist view we need to consider on what is morally permissible and we must consider what the best interest of the mother and child is . relating to abortion if we outlaw most abortions and when a woman and her doctor think they are killing a non viable being they would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter but it is hard to judge someone criminally negligent for not personally believing that a pre sentient embryo is a viable person when we do not actually know this to be the case . there are also cases where women are morons they are promiscuous and do not know the outcomes of having sex we should not let the woman and the baby suffer . now even though we can say that the benefit of the doubt will go life we still would not consider this action to become a killing of an innocent person i e murder .  million per year this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion this process is more dangerous expensive and of course unlawful  . do you want children to live in the streets to suffer and live with abusive parents . if we are following pro s logic on embryo being humans then abortion would be tragic and lethal and should result to murder in all cases there should be no exceptions meaning that this will result to many bad consequences . rebuttal re fetus human again all my opponent has argued here is that the potential life inside the woman s womb is part of the species homo sapiens and that it will evolve and eventually become a human being . now to address his rebuttal okay let us say that contraceptives failed thus the woman woke up pregnant . defense case de morality my opponent dismisses this argument stating that it is irrelevant and that i have the bop . it was the woman s intention to use birth control and wished not have a life attached her but it failed ,1
38,i accept this debate challenge ,0
39,good luck on the next phase of the tourney ,1
40,with a consent of a parent or consent from a guardian the child is being advice from an adult before they continue with taking someones life . i do believe that a minor should need consent for an abortion . some people may not understand what an abortion is until it is done ,0
41,yet you state that with late term abortions they do not feel pain etc . you have to be willing to accept that abortion a week before the due date is okay even if a commonly thought of exception does not apply . no sane person would say the victim should be able to be terminated ,0
42,definitions explanations restricted abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy . the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age . medical non surgical abortions using medications such as mifepristone  are available in some clinics ,1
43,the first is unable to stain life due to functions of their body and the second is just simply not helping a person when there are weak . the child may have the definition of living but their ability to understand and reason is not to a point that they would even understood that they ever lived . and if their mother does not want the pregnancy obviously she did not mean for the child to be created either . if a person is unable to breath well enough to sustain their own life and allowing them to pass on is different than not giving them food and water when they are not able to feed themselves . if a parent did not want that child she only gives it to someone who would take care of it ,1
44,I am sure there are people who are legally obligated to report a loss of life ,1
45,but again that logic does not work to born people we do not throw away human life outside the womb when they are infants and incapable to reason their own existence . we do not kill those with autism because they can not communicate whether they want to live or not . further you say the unborns ability to reason makes them worthless and because they are not conscious we can just kill them . this whole attitude that we can separate sex from procreation is nonsense to me the thought that we must end one life to keep the comfort of another is sad . except in the case of rape a women has engaged in an act that by its nature has the possibility of creating life ,0
46,all points extended ,1
47,they make the woman feel guilty for wanting to abort the child the woman should feel guilty she had deprived her unborn child with experiences such as graduation and marriage ,0
48,only in the green countries mothers can have abortion in the others abortion only happens if it is the only way to save a mothers life . i can deny that for sure some women get abortions because they are selfish but this does not mean that all of them are selfish . if you want to debate the morality of middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester put up another debate . three fourths say they cannot afford a child half say they are having problems with their husband or partner as you can see all the reasons are not selfish . then nearly a bit less than half of the globe rather than in most countries .  lastly i want to emphasise the generalising nature of the resolution . they make a rather silly reasoning but they think in others thus they are not being selfish . pro is stating that all middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish . in this debate we are arguing about the selfishness related to this decision ,1
49,if you think that even one type of abortion should still exist because it does not meet the definition of recall that this is pros whole case then you are voting con . pro still fails to provide any reasoning for why a fetus which has yet to achieve personhood should be considered a person . nor does the presence of a beating heart make a person might as well just point to any essential organ and proclaim it the essence of personhood . he added another argument that a fetus is separate from the mother which I will address but otherwise he is left all of my arguments standing . every cell on our bodies has human dna that does not make every cell a person ,1
50,on a side point given con has the highest elo on this site I am honored that con has chosen to debate this ,0
51,is an infant aware the same way you are aware . is it aware of emotions like sorrow and grief . does it know what year it is ,0
52,if you claim it does why have not you been forced to donate one of your kidneys a few lung lobes bone marrow blood liver pieces etc . if abortion is illegal dead people will officially have more rights than pregnant people because a dead person s organs can not be used if they are not a consenting organ donor . here are the main things bodily autonomy is the most important argument because it is bulletproof really . abortions are going to happen no matter what so if you really care about pregnant people you had better simmer down and let abortion be . you may support for unborn children but the truth is they are already equal no born person has the right to infringe on someone elses bodily autonomy . some animals eat poisonous plants and some even walk through spaces too small for them to crush the fetus .  even if you will not let the idea go that abortion is murder it is justifiable homicide self defense ,1
53,as the rules were pretty loose i do not want to take advantage and get an extra round out of the situation so i will not put forth my arguments in round  ,0
54,I am talking about humans and not demons ,0
55,in regards to killing a fetus a fetus that is in the womans body for a certain amount of time does have a brain but it still does not know anything . if they pay for it through fines then that still means the government is paying for it just not with taxpayer dollars . if a woman gives birth to a child then that child could become a good person or a bad person . this is another reason that women should be allowed to have an abortion . if the child is not taken care of well then it could become a bad person ,1
56,everything has consequences it does not matter if your ready or not it is not your choice once the baby is conceived it is alive and yours . that does not matter when deciding wether to abort or not abort a child . you never know what will happen to any childs life in a formidable family broken or other ,0
57,that baby is innocent and has the right to at least live a life even if its put up for adoption so its not there to be a constant reminder to the mother and it can be a closed adoption ,0
58,well i know it is hard to raise a child these days but their are other ways to not take care of the child one way is adoption another is to let her parents take car of it ,0
59,i may have forgot to mention that both my parents are gps and i listen to their opinions because i trust it and they are both very experienced in the medical profession i will say that my dad had to be convinced about pro life but the mother is hard core she is my main sourse of opinion along with personal research . in the upcoming referendum in ireland if i had a vote i would vote no to abortion being brought in because as a girl and soon to be a woman who plans to live the rest of their life and start a family here i believe it is something that should be kept out of ireland . at first my aunt did not believe the lady and questioned why any hospital would ever make her kill her own perfectly healthy child but then she realised in england you are so vulnerable to the doctors decisions on your situation and you may be hauled into an abortion of your child against your will . basically on the top of my chimney there is a nest of jackdaws and it is illegal for me to move the nest because the mother is minding all her eggs which i fully accept because i know they are endangered etc . i was thinking back on what nell mcafferty said about the killing at the sommes and it made me think about the extermination of jewish people they did not choose genocide . but i fully reject the argument that it is too expensive to have a special needs child or even just a child because that is teaching our children and others that life is disposable and cheap . if the baby dies naturally in the process of saving the mothers life then so be it ,0
61,an abortion after that point only happens under special circumstances such as when it is killing the mother or has serious defects that will kill it and the fetus is euthanized before a  trimester abortion meaning it feels none of the abortion . eeg suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in fetuses probably does not exist before  or  weeks a point after which abortion is rare and illegal this study asserted that withdrawal reflexes and changes in heart rates and hormone levels in response to invasive procedures are reflexes that do not indicate fetal pain . so really taken in total aborting a fetus is like choosing to swat an obnoxious fly buzzing around or like parents choosing to pull the plug on their braindead vegetable child . if abortion is illegal dead people will officially have more rights than pregnant people because a dead persont be used if they aren t an organ donor . but disabled people are still autonomous because they are sentient beings and don t live inside the body of another person and suck up their nutrients ,1
62,imagine a world in which female could get access to forms of birth control that did not depend on their male sexual partners using a condom . instead of having an abortion females will have the zygote fetus etc removed from them implanted into an artificial womb who would then be born an orphan seeking adoption . no reason that someone who let us reason rule emotion could possibly accept . imagine a world where instead of teaching children to just wait despite all of their emotions that play to the contrary we teach them that condoms fail more often than we would like to think .  solutions as i said earlier any responsible debate on abortion should include solutions that both parties can agree upon . why is our argument centered around what we will never agree upon arbitrary lines all around rather than partial solutions that are easily within reach easily agreeable by both sides and a full solution that may be within reach in our lifetimes . with improvements to our adoption system we may be able to find homes for all such births . after answering you have to convince the audience of why your position of valuing human is superior to my position of valuing personhood in order to win the debate . this is the world of abstinence only education . they believe pulling out is an excellent form of birth control failing to understand precum in the slightest . by denying women the ability to choose when to have their children you are in fact killing the children they would otherwise have in the future . again the anti abortion crowd for some reason seems to not accept this calling it socialism calling it the government trying to enforce responsibility on people . the government does not force women to use this it merely empowers them with a choice they can make that many cannot currently make . there is no reason this should not be agreed upon by both sides . to conclude my opponent must address my challenge in  or i can give him no additional credit . if he is responsible he will also address the potential solutions that we may both agree upon . as a teacher who teaches children as young as  how to play classical music i submit you will be surprised at how children react when given a modicum of respect and well thought ideas ,1
63,i asked for an opponent that was for abortions but against killing them outside the womb ,1
64, just because the woman is no longer pregnant does not mean they are not a mother of a child but now the are the mother of a dead child . d actual lyrics mommy that is my arm why are they tearing my arm the baby feels no pain and so would not realise that someone is tearing their arm even though doctors do not tear arms . pro claims that the foetus is human at any point at least that is what i gather so is the ball of cells formed after the conception human as as pro claims it has the potential to be human .   pro provdes no definition or indication of what she believes is or indeed what is a human life form . now let us go through this statement by statement pro has provided no evidence for her views and so we are forced to take her at her word it may be their body but now they are sharing it with a whole other human life form . that is a very interesting area and one that i will come back to next round .  this mother has no children and it can be surmised that she does not want this ball of cells child as pro insists on labelling it their little hearts beat inside their mother . but while we are on the subject of could have let us examine some actual statistics on the type of women most likely to have an abortion . this is for various reasons but the most salient every baby is a gift and a blessing this gift should not be returned . what about people who have clearly done bad in their lives and caused widespread misery and pain such as hitler stalin .  non hispanic blacks and hispanics are most likely to be aborted as those same groups have the highest rates of unintended pregnancy . no doubt there are deeply inhumane ways to abort but the ways we have now are humane and the baby feels no pain . it is pointless to focus on what could have been . pro has stated that the mothers body is not hers anymore it belongs to the nonsentient foetus . orwelltoday com a website that is stated aim is comparing the world george orwell described in with the world we are living in today                it promotes global warming denalism and several jfk conspiracies ,1
65,the baby inside the mothers womb is a genetically different human being than the mother so the question is how is killing a baby inside the womb or one minute out of the womb any different . first of all you can always deliver the baby after  weeks giving the mother and the baby a chance to live . a key question to any pro choice is when does life begin . lastly the word fetus comes from latin roots meaning a child up to the age of eighteen . instead of saying not to have sex because you are a minor they give out condemns and birth control . if penetration of the vagina is indeed illegal if the legal age is not reached why then should it be legal for vaginal penetration to occur the other way before that age . before it can feel pain a so you are saying if one cannot feel pain than it is okay to kill him her ,0
66,you cannot say or well i think that parents are certainly more educated in the field of abortion when compared to their teenage daughters . abortions could leave to future ectopic pregnancies a mother has a  chance of dieing in an ectopic pregnancy women who abort are  more vulnerable to breast cancer abruptio placenta which is when the sac holding the baby the placenta tears away from the uterine lining . opponent i will simply disagree with the pros argument that parents can be better judges than physicians in regards to when a medical abortion is necessary to terminate an I will pregnancy that can physically harm the child . and judges complete strangers should not be able to dictate to parents what is in the best interests of their children . women who have experienced abortion have a  increase in their risk for abruptio placenta in future pregnancies emotional distress including acute feeling of grief depression anger fear of disclosure preoccupation with babies or getting pregnant again nightmares sexual dysfunction termination of relationships emotional coldness increased alcohol and drug abuse eating disorders anxiety flashbacks of the abortion procedure anniversary syndrome repeat abortions suicide many of these women go on to report that they regret their choice and would do anything to go back and undo the decision that resulted in so much pain ,0
67,would our government need to drastically change yead but still as for the usa we are not bound to be overpopulated for quite a while if ever . nobody denies that a rape victim should be able to get an abortion . as well as this to make it even more clearer by saying a fetus is not developed you are saying a baby to be born in minutes on it is expected week is undeveloped ,0
68,if the abortion cannot be waived or have no insuarnce a person can also realize how expensive this procedure is . when an indivdual experience having an abortion they may feel regret or guilt but that is not something a phychologist can help with . a person should research the many types of abortions such as induce herbs medical surgical and misscarge to decide which one is better for your health ,1
69,so it follows that all humans born or unborn should be protected by this law and thus making abortion illegal ,0
71,if that is your sole argument then i believe we are indeed finished and by my laws which say that these internet laws are not worth nil when it comes to debating i will proclaim myself the winner since you appear to have no better argument . they seem good for a fun game but when it comes to real debating then i want a real debater with real reasons for their argument . I am trying to have a meaningful debate where the opponent makes a far better argument than some silly internet tradition ,0
72,if abortion is murder reducto argument if it is the case that abortion in the embryonic stage is equivalent to murder as some anti choicers assert then that means all women who have had an abortion in that period should all be in jail doing sentences for murder maybe even the death penalty as well as any future women who will have such an abortion . they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own . like wise it is argued a pregnant women can take action to be unplugged from the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with a pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep some one else alive such is yours hers bodily rights freedom . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus for my purposes in this debate the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person . the logical point is that any anti abortion argument that is built upon such an absolute right to life right not to be killed has at it is foundation a false premise and can be rejected as such not to mention the double standard of selectively applying it in the case of pregnancy to deny abortion rights . or  reject such a conclusion based on the realization that abortion is murder in the embryonic stage is false premise to begin with . a case for unequal moral equivalence  year old child vs   human embryos consider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door are   day human embryos behind another a  year old child . for example we do not consider it an unjust burden to demand enforce that people do not poison the water supply but we would consider it an unjust burden to say restrict people to only wearing thick wool coats no matter how hot it is . but as i argue they are not equal the  year old child not only trumps one  day human embryo it even trumps one hundred . think about it the likes of charles manson ted bundy and next to them endless row cells of women who had an abortion in the embryonic stage ,1
73,in this circumstance the most effective methods are preventive birth control condoms and informing each pregnant woman who is trying to make a decision of all her potential options including helping her meet couples looking to adopt children and informing her of all available support programs available should she choose to raise the child herself . desperate women are going to get an abortion regardless of legality if it is the only course they feel is open to them restrictive laws do not reduce abortions . legal restriction does have a significant harmful impact on the safety of a procedure ,1
74,also since it is mybelief that men should not rape women if i were a pharmacist would i have a right to deny a man his viagra just in case he uses it to rape . having another member of the family is extremely expensive i am sure there are stats on this but without internet i cannot check them and it should not be forced on people governments should stay out of the bedroom . until we can say that you will not get a baby is you use this super condem or any other form of  effective birth control we should not take abortions away . i would like to now point out that by requesting an abortion the mother is stating that she cannot care for does not want or cannot have the child inside her body . we should be attempting as a society to produce children that are wholesome and grow up in a happy and healthy household with both parents who care for them as that will produce the best results for a society to grow . i will go more in depth into this later on in the debate . the united states has already risen over the religious institutions in legalising gay marriage which is a very big step in the direction of the free mind and body movement . well it is because we need to offer the women a foolproof option of getting rid of a child that will not be loved cared for and was a stake weather by not having it made in the first place or by cutting it off before it is born . or the child could be put into an orphanage a drain on the system never knowing its mother depressed and lonely ,1
75,have you ever looked at it that way ,0
76,if not then one of two things is true either the victim was afraid to report it which is totally understandable or it was not actually rape . would aborting the baby change history and totally erase the rape in every way shape and form . the questions i posed regarding rape my opp does seem to have the initial same answer as me is it the unborn babys fault the woman got raped . you are then forced into a lengthy and expensive court battle to try and get the child into adoption . but even after the child is born the rapist could then step in to legally block the adoption . what judge jury in their right mind would really let a sex offender have access to a child that they allegedly took part in creating . finally you are forced to pay money to your rapist for the next  years all because he raped you ,0
77,i would argue for the childs in this case seeing as the mother has already lived and experienced life where as the baby did not even get that chance baby from beginning if you do not know this already you can research this . the law prevents child abuse and just because the parents did not want the child and abuse him her does not mean that its right . but that should not suggest that someone else can not care for the child . when it comes down to abortion or the mothers life it is really just a matter of opinion of who is life would be more important in the situation . to not let that child live because of his her fathers wrong doing . noot that every persons decision is what should matter . but at least he got to take the chance and let nature decide whether that child would die or not . that is what i meant when i said the mother can survive  months of emotional turmoil . sexually abused child again this is where adoption comes in . this debate has been really fun thankyou for accepting it . child abuse again as i have stated in the previous round abusive parenting is not an issue with abortion either . the baby had that oppurtunity at having a life the second the mother was pregnant . my opponent is saying that it is better just to let the child die than taking that  chance . i know it was not the mother fault that she is pregnant . what you are referring to in this case is what is called a a stillborn is a child who does not take in its surroundings or its life in any way . and if the child dies the child dies and there is nothing anyone can do about it . so is killing a child based off an indefinite source the right thing to do in this case . and the child life is not going to be dramatically challenged to the point the death would be the answer . it does not get a choice on whether it lives or dies and unlike the mother it does not get the chance to even attempt to live it is life ,0
78,the fact that this planet has continued to sustain us humans as long as we have existed in our diabolical number is a miracle in itself far greater than moses splitting the red sea or jesus turning bread to flesh and water to wine . and it is also very true that many people who do not follow a faith also are strongly against abortion and i would just like to point out that neither do i find it a pleasing nor happy concept that abortion is legal but i do strongly wholeheartedly understand that it is a completely necessary process just as was world war i and ii horrific dreadful but necessary to protect the world as we know it . simple abortion is a cruel and cold way of helping this planet but it is a way we must not forget that while we sit comfortably at our warm homes drinking cold beer while typing away on our laptops me anyway that millions people women men and children could benefit from abortion . agreed abortion is but one of the ways to curb the overpopulation of the planet but it is still a way a way that that would help millions of impoverished women to ease the strain on themselves and their families already beset by poverty and in many cases starvation . by having a further child they are putting further strain on their family and in many cases the new born child will not live to adulthood . again forgive my terrible analogy but we humans are like an infestation of rats on this beautiful planet except in our case there is no exterminator . hard as it may seem to accept this is a case where the unborn unconscious child has to be murdered so to help the survival of his born conscious living breathing siblings who would otherwise would be murdered through war starvation and disease ,1
79,you are old enough to hav the responcibility of a kid . something that has not even seen the light of day you are killing because you do not want to have that responcibility . also many people use this as a birth control people use abortion instead just so they do not have to take the pill which is the worst case to me ,0
80,i will consider this my accepting statement and give pro the floor to make his case as to why abortion is wrong ,1
81,if asked certainly no citizen will argue with the phrase but once you go into detail that is where you will find that people would not extend this to include murdering someone whom they are likely to themselves consider more or less innocent . pro goes on to mention that these murders saved innocent lives however many of these women would likely have just went elsewhere to acquire their abortions and many could argue that saving one innocent life by killing another innocent life as the is not a binding or even detailed law of any sort is ultimately still worse as the murder will gravely hurt those who knew the doctor .   that aside few people would ever agree to the blatant murder of others for an act which many do not consider wrong . in order to make the right choice we must not make the mistake of allowing an appeal to emotion to cloud our judgement . while my opponent may consider mentioning peoples moralities as an appeal to popularity as I am referencing that most are against his views however appeal to popularity is informal and it is fully acceptable to mention it when we are referencing the general view of the nation . we have seen many other times with places such as ferguson mo that we already have a precarious situation with people openly defying law in violent manners that last thing we need is to push deeper . pro mentions a woman who spoke up about being made to keep the child however this is again an appeal to emotion and does not answer for the fact that in an alternate version where the woman did not keep the child she is likely to also be just as happy . part  we would not limit ourselves to legal and educational remedies that might possibly stop the bloodshed in the future rather we would take the immediate action necessary to save one another . closing statement i end this round by reiterating that we must bear in mind the dangerous precedence set in the idea that we can or in pros words must act in a violent and illegal manner even resorting to murder based on our personal interpretation of morality . if we consider something to be justified under our own personal interpretation of this then we can do it . certainly these people would not support murder of the doctor as they do not consider his actions amoral . opponents may bring in the fact that the bible also ordains a genocide to make room for the jews . if questioned we would assert the moral necessity of taking this action ,1
82,also if this was true that doctors had to ask permission to abort the baby then we would be doing it with every abortion and since it takes so long that she would be dead anyway then we would have no babies being aborted and they would be all born . there may be pain but its not worth ending a life for . yeah i can not send her to school but there are tutors that many people use or home schooling . I am not sure what exactly counts in determining when the baby is alive .  if abortion were illegal the doctors could not just request the government let them slide by the law to save her life . it is the government consulting with the doctors to make sure that there is no other way . there is drugs and c sections so it is not all pain .  something is illegal is illegal there are plenty of it is ands or buts in laws . sometimes the assaulter uses protection sometimes girls are on birth control sometimes the egg is not fertilized and sometimes females lose the baby along the way ,0
83,yes fetuses are living creations ,0
84,my argument is that the mother should have the say in whether they get an abortion or not ,1
85,my opponent has failed to respond to my statistic that ninety five percent of women who have had abortions do not regret the decision to terminate their pregnanciesconclusion to conclude this debate i believe that i have won for the following reasons . arguments con essentially concedes and even if you do not view that as a concession then if you look back at my opponents argument for round  you will realise that that was not much better than forfeiting . conduct it is also interesting to note that my opponent copy and pasted a lot of his arguments from this website and did not quote them is an example . you can not argue against the death penalty and then say that it is only okay for the worst criminals to have the death penalty a debate does not work this way . spelling and grammar tiedsources as well as cons sources being bias they have also copy and pasted a lot of their argument as stated above in greater detail ,1
86,rebuttal  kantian ethics it seems odd that one would appeal to john stuart mills ethical system and then right afterwards immanuel kants as the two men definitely disagreed on matters of ethics . rebuttal  adoption as an alternative in the case of rape my opponent finally argues that abortion would still be a punishment to the baby even though no punishment is inferred on the part of the mother . it has been noted that my opponent has argued that we do not legalize things based on them being a detriment to society but rather for the basis of immorality which really is like answering a question with a question . rebuttal  justification for killing my opponent has only granted one instance for ending another life which is self defense or i guess the health of the mother in aborting a baby . rebuttal  moral consistency i will simply charge that i do not think my opponent has sufficiently determined why one must be consistent . this ethical system makes presuppositions about the metaphysical nature of mankind and thus based on these assumptions makes man the one who determines morality makes it contradictory to then assert that morality is a priori . in my opinion this brings up a fatal hole in my opponents argument in that murder requires malice aforethought and if it does not apply in the context he allows why then does it apply in other situations . my opponent has charged me with committing the appeal to extremes fallacy which to me demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of this fallacy . the fetus can only develop consciousness after a brain has been developed and prior to this time there is no potential for consciousness to arise . rebuttal  anencephalic baby my opponent agrees that there is no instrumental purpose for keeping the anencephalic baby alive but then argues that this basis would allow for the euthanizing of the elderly . argument  the value of human beings is not in the fact of life being a living organism but rather in the ability to have consciousness and experience pain and joy ,1
87,i thank my opponent for creating this debate and contrary to the woes of those in the comment sections I am sure i will not fall for whatever sly trick my opponent may have used d quote as my opponent is affirmative the burden of proof lies on him her . simple as that it is brain is not fully developed to meet such a criteria .  fetuses do not have rights because a fetus is not self aware it does not have rights ,1
88,abortion is murder taking away the life of an innocent unborn child ,0
89,definitions abortion a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy and because the death of the fetus ,0
90,thus it is only at the point where the fetus is no longer a fetus that we consider it to be alive . if a fetus remains in that state after birth is should be considered non living . i fail to see how the two combined dying ever holds a moral significance over the two alone . in much the same way if abortion is legal that does not mean that dr . my opponent ignores this entire paragraph from my last round but taking a step back for a moment I am still failing to see the difference between wearing a condom and aborting a fetus . my opponent goes on to say that very young or very old people cannot survive themselves either that does not mean we should kill them . he says a person in a vegetated state is not living ,1
92,a fetus in the first trimester has no consciousness and cannot feel pain it is not aware of its own existence mothers should have a choice to what happens to their body controlling birth is an efficient method of preventing human overpopulation it is cruel to force a pregnant woman to die just because the child will live longer than her it is irresponsible to force someone that cannot take care of a child to give birth my opponents arguments a full life like a newborn baby is worth more than a part life like a mother given by the equation c x q x d v where c is the chance q is the quality decrease and d is the duration . if you believe a mother should be forced to die so that she may give birth simply because the child would live longer than she would congratulations to my opponent  . the way my opponent has fraised it a bigger decrease in quality of life would result in a higher value . my opponents argument against this is somewhat confusing so your saying that two people that live far away from each do not have the potential to create a child . my arguments if preventing a life due to abortion is bad then any type of birth control is equally bad you cannot murder what is not yet alive . before i begin my final argument i would like to tally the pros vs cons of this debate that have been made so far . i do not think my opponent realizes the dramatic effects over population would have on the human race ,1
95,he is not able to debate on the actual issues at hand so chooses to go off on a tangent ,1
96,the fetus is being killed because of what an inconvenience parenthood would be for the mother . no single person gets to decide if one lives or dies born or unborn . no more than  weeks after fertilization the fetus starts to react to touch ,0
97,the parents could be unready for a child because of financial or personal reasons so it should be legal even though it is still very wrong ,1
98,pros standard of was applied to the woman in comparison to the fertilized egg by arguing that the womans right to govern her body could be derive from human nature in the manner that pro claimed to derive a right against dehumanization . most damaging was pros inclusion of a rape exemption by which makes it abundantly clear that even he acknowledges the substantial inferiority of the egg . pro again declined to counter the point directly claiming that no right and implicitly no human worth had been established for either the woman or society . if the extremely narrow definition of human worth proposed by pro is accepted it is then the job of pro to establish that the human worth of a fertilized egg is greater than the human worth of an adult woman . thus according to the dictionary the fertilized egg is not a human being and the resolution based upon that assumption fails .  pro used an incorrect definition of and failed to rebut the numerous arguments that even if a fertilized egg were considered a human being that the eggs worth was inferior to humans who had been born . buy observing the traditions of society we know that society universal treats the death of a fertilized egg in a way much inferior to the death of a human being . having argued that a fertilized egg was a not a human being and that even if deemed a human being was judged by society to are vastly inferior worth i argued that therefore the rights of the woman and of society should prevail . thus pro implicitly acknowledged tat by his own standards the proposition maintaining that the egg suffers greater harm fails . if the fertilized egg is nonetheless maintained to be a human being then society clearly affords it a much inferior worth than that of human that have been born . this question has long been resolved in favor of human rights being the standard for and not the new standard which pro has proposed ,1
99,it seems to me that a pretty strong case can be given for such a position even if i still think it is ultimately flawed although pro s presentation of this argument is unnecessarily weak . pro s first criticism is that her  possibilities for the wrongness of killing inflicted pain objecting to death harm to loved ones were not to be taken as exhaustive . pro simply does not engage at all with the main features of the argument marquis  examples plus my additional  cases the desire account or the flo account for the wrongness of killing . as for the case against abortion I would ask pro to actually get involved and engage with the argument at hand flo rather than rely on the ultra concise general and transparently superficial assertions offered thus far . even if it were the case that following thomson one could unplug from the unborn such a position is practically useless for abortion choice given that the vast vast majority of abortion methods directly attack the body of the human foetus  . using philosopher don marquis examples as well as others i examined pro s possible explanations for this general account and found  of them to be ably dismissed with trivial ease . however i do not want to rely on the fallibility of pro s presentation so let us suppose a good case for bodily rights had been made . as for pro s insistence that sentience is relevant to the right to life without an argument such a claim is obviously question begging . foetal bodily rights given I have already shown pro s denial of foetal bodily autonomy to be nonsense I will proceed as such . pro s only remaining viable account pro was deemed hopelessly flawed by working through cases a e . if a foetus can not feel pain does not object to death or does not have loved ones i could respond as pro does that pro s conditions are just some of the harms that come from killing and . as such not only has pro effectively dropped an argument she gave in defence of abortion but my argument stands almost entirely unscathed . pro then asserts that killing is wrong not due to the harm it causes the victim but because of the malicious intent of the would be murderer ,0
101,not only is it in bad taste to characterize your opponent either specifically or in the general sense of people who disagree with you it is not a valid means of argument . thus if minimal violence is used against the fetus in an abortion the procedure does not violate its rights . pros argument would lead to the conclusion that we have an obligation to build sentient robots that can engage in discourse and thus have a moral duty toward metals that can be mined from the earth . patient dichotomy does not matter because i am contending that we are not acting immorally toward the fetus not that we do not have to behave morally toward it . if a child assaulted someone this would certainly be grounds for that person to stop taking care of it . construing abortion as the use of a fetus as a means to have sex without giving birth is a rather twisted interpretation of my ethical approach . in his continued unsupported assertion of the positive right to life pro points out that he has a right not to be placed in a volcano because he cannot survive there . i accept pros formulation of my argument as reasonably fair though he seems to have misunderstood it at points as i will discuss . children qua children are not violating anyones rights simply by existing while this may very well be the case for a fetus . another substantial issue with this point is that even if the born do have the right to life and this has hardly been proven it would not necessarily mean fetuses do too . this is just broadening the meaning of the word use beyond its relevance to the topic . an ss officer concedes that his position is morally invalid by refusing to debate it . in my original context the word use referred only to using a body as a physical instrument a life support system specifically .  final comment on fetal innocence i am not going to make new comments on this because it is not part of pros offensive but i will remind readers that i specifically addressed pros point about active and passive rights violations in my affirmative case under  . even if this was not the case i have attacked positive rights in every round of this debate and i proposed my own coherent moral theory which allows for abortion ,1
102,i had high hopes for this debate and I am glad to see moonshine has improved from his last debates with me ,1
103,it is not there is no other evidence that abortion promotes a culture in witch human life is disposable  . again  com is not a unbiased etc etcthis is the hippocratic oath as reproduced by the webpage here for amusement purposes i will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it nor will i make a suggestion to this effect .  the study again says the classification of other than direct maternal deaths was ambiguous meaning the assertion of abortion leads to suicide by this website by its own evidence is disprovennote the study in question is a good piece of scientific work and i am not attempting to diss or otherwise demean its methodology simply that the argument made by the website is invalid . the modern version contains the phrase but it may also be within my power to take a life this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty . this is a very small sample size and as such is not very good to back up such a sweeping statement as abortion kills made by the website  . however as i stated above this is not a life that we are taking and con pro . if con pro does not rebut them next round this debate should be considered an autowin for me . this is a perfect example of the fallacy of authority assuming something must be correct because it is said by an authority figure in this case the pope .  I would like to know just why the website thinks that the original version is in any way better than the modern version which is now taken by all doctors ,0
104,welcome to the site i look forward to an interesting and stimulating debate ,0
105,if the united states government truly wanted to assist in darfur by helping to feed people it is their responsibility to find money in a place that would because less harm and subsequent misery e g instead of taking half of the money made by a particular family perhaps taking a small percentage of money as some type of tax to aid in resolving world hunger and thus meaning that the extremely wealthy would pay a larger sum of money than those who would strike financial misery by having the government deduct such a large sum of monetary value . again i advocate in this debate that third trimester abortions assuming development within normal parameters be illegal in the united states unless the life of the mother is at stake . in your analogy the females or for that matter anyone else are not directly killing the parasites by choosing not to serve as their hosts . only then after all of the above was vigilantly attempted and if they fail and if at least one side remains ignorant to the other might war be considered a final resort . and even if it did do physical harm to her is some circumstances i stated in my opening argument that an exception to the illegalization of third trimester abortions would include if the . is it good national policy for force all females to serve as hosts to these sentient parasites . again i ask that you answer these questions leftover from my round  first of all are you arguing that the killing of a baby i e after birth is acceptable given your arguments presented . since sentient life is more important than the quality of life we should have just let black people keep slaving away at the plantations as long as their slave masters only beat them and not kill them . in reference to your argument  personal liberties need not be forfeited as adoption is still a valid method of preventing the loss of sentient life . if a sentient parasite is physically damaging another being one should not force the being to serve as a host to it . if the government had not intervened slavery might still have been a severe problem today meaning an additional  years of the malevolent practice resulting in the physical harm and killing of many more slaves ,0
106,feeling a bit better now i suggest we restart this debate next week as i have to deal with some other personal things to deal with before i can continue this debate ,0
107,rational basis before i start with the argument I will note that preventing a woman from having an abortion should not happen without any benefits to that ban because then it would be unnecessary paternalism the law requires to be passed . subpoint b people face psychological harms from being denied an abortion if a woman is denied a safe abortion research suggests that she might face psychological harms e g anxiety or depression . if a person does something with no harm to non consensual others they should be allowed to do it . that is the reason that in times of war military conscription is legal it would save more lives .  resolutional analysis the resolution is framed in the form of a question which states . banning abortion harms women subpoint a women die from back alley abortions as already established abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and countries where it is not legal . when abortion is illegal it is very tough to afford appropriate medical conditions and regulations expected in hospitals . emotional states are the only things that allow such positive or negative impact . subpoint a the right to life should not extend to fetuses con says . conclusion there is absolutely no rational basis for a law on abortions since it will not allow a fetuss right to life to be respected nor will it stop or reduce the amount of abortions taking place . in fact there will not even be a reduction in abortions ,1
108,until we take a stand and let the government know we are serious about our morality ethics and values there will be no end to the debate . we were told something would get done about abortion and we got the partial birth abortion bill which actually did next to nothing for the pro life because . we were told something would get done about our current over taxation only duct tape and bubble gum were applied ,0
109,the big abortion question is when does life start and i think it starts when the sperm and the egg combine and the cell is created . my opponent says the government has no right to tell people what they can cannot do with others bodies . the woman does have control of their body she can not get pregnant ,0
110,extend all arguments ,1
111,but the reason abortion is and always should be legal is a matter of the personal right too make a choice . first of all i make my argument assuming we are both on the same ground about early abortions .  economics one of the reasons a mother has an abortion is because the father walks out on her or she simply can not afford to have a baby at the time ,1
112,i assume you will bring up the matter of when life begins . the death penalty is applied to guilty criminals whereas abortion deals with an innocent life . my definition is that when the potential for life begins developing i e conception life is set forth ,0
113,this is misleading in partial birth abortion as the term suggests the foetus is not fully born when it is killed the purpose of collapsing the skull is to allow the foetus head to pass more easily through the birth canal ,1
114,any surgical process that a person may need or want even if it means life or death if the person does not want it performed on their body they should be forced to . the parent should be aware of any procedure that their child is having done but the child herself should be able to make final decisions about her own body . now i do believe that teenagers should have the ability to have an abortion without parental consent ,1
115,take this mental picture a person walks into a store buys an item then goes home she realizes she does not want it so she want to give it back ,0
116,if we don t think about them we only can have the views fed to us by the media and our parents . i think we need to cut  weeks because the  is not the morally relevant dividing line . you are not suggesting when fetuses feel pain they do not have an interest for the pain to stop . if done on interests then i believe that  and certainly  should be the dividing line as then they have interests as they can feel pleasure and pain . or do they suddenly get interests when they first see daylight ,0
117,firstly motherly instincts when you have a child kicks in and you feel a overwhelming desire to keep the child whether you can support it or not secondly even if a woman could overcome those motherly instincts society could push her to not get it adopted  relationship issues sometimes when women get pregnant men leave them .  health issues for the mother in many cases birth can kill the mother who is experiencing other illnesses here is an article of a woman who was middle class who died after being refused an abortion  health issues of the fetus genetics of the parents can because extreme birth defects that could kill or make the child suffer . okay thanks for the clarification now on to the meat of the issue many women have abortions for multiple reasons  finacially unstable many women could be in higher education or are really working hard for a promotion ,1
118,hopefully you will be back in the next round ,0
119,you parents might actually be willing to support you if you knew ,0
120,for example if someone has a miscarriage then that means that the mothers body was not strong enough or capable to protect it and make it a human being but in case of the surgery abortion the reasons are that she is too young and her life will be ruined but she is just not accepting the consequences of her mistake she will not learn from that .  if the mothers life is in danger then i guess in that case there should be an abortion yes I am agreeing with you that under some circumstances there should be an abortion . i do not care what if i go out there and murder a child infanticide then i do not think the government should intervene because they should leave it to the matters of the individual who is committing murder to a human being not to a person . as you see not all children fit within the qualities a person needs so they are just human beings and not people so they do not have the right to life either . i believe it does not matter where you are abortions and child birth are the same thing ,0
121,so a woman should have the decision right to have an abortion if she gets raped . and if she gets pregnant and gives birth and its to late to have an abortion because she had no choice but to keep it then she will have to live with something she never wanted . i believe that if a woman gets raped she should have the decision right to have an abortion ,1
122,public education has taught me that only scores matter ,1
123,is terminating a fetus which can neither feel emotions nor be conscious of its own really be considered equivalent to killing a . other sets of criteria conclude that an embryo lacks personhood and a right to life because it lacks self consciousness rationality and autonomy . an embryo is not a person because it satisfies only one criterion namely consciousness and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain ,1
124,this is pro life pro the life of the woman and so respects the dignity of life ,1
125,one could argue that you should be able to have your kidney forcibly taken from you to help another person who is dying because this other persons interaction and interactions from his relieved family members will be a net positive to society . the study actually stated that women who abort actually suffer more than those who do not because it is likely that the victim already harbors feelings of guilt as a result of the assault medico social pressures which encourage and result in abortion could compound the woman s feelings of guilt and self blame perhaps as a result of their own biases and an unwillingness to deal with the more emotionally difficult complications of a pregnant rape victim many physicians suggest abortion in this case as one would prescribe aspirin for tension headache while on the surface this suggestion may appear acceptable and even humane to many the victim is dealt another disservice . thus the parents and particularly the mother are viewed as owning the child instead of being the natural guardian s of the child . often the offer of such quick and easy solutions as abortion only serve those who are uncomfortable or unwilling to deal with the special problems and needs that such complications as pregnancy might present .  from this stage onward a new human organism exists one which we all had to pass through to arrive at our current level of development . this moral equality is the this was most famously penned in the us declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness . what we are debating is the whether or not a human being has a right to its own life dependent on the circumstances either she or her mother will face now or in the future . one cannot pursue happiness if one does not have a right to liberty and one cannot have liberty if one does not have a right to life . i posit that we live in a world that has come to realize the inherent and inalienable rights of humanity . now while it is true that our societal interactions can be positive for society this belief would make it justifiable to kill hermits or the homeless who choose not to interact with others . the child will grow up with unloving parents if there are indeed  parents . the unborn being afforded no such interaction with the world are thus easy to dehumanize into objects with scientific terms like fetus and embryo . once she is on the operating table she loses control over her body . and it is this right to life that is being dismissed if people accept that there are times in which abortion should be allowed . giving birth especially when conception was not desired is a totally selfless act a generous act a display of courage strength and honor ,0
126,if the parents of adolf hitler osama bin laden saddam hussein muammar al gaddafi robert mugabe kim il sung pol pot idi amin and countless other evil despots tyrants terrorists and dictators had had the legal right to retrospectively abort their offspring the world would be a better place . mr hitler we can only hope . perhaps his anti social behaviour is just a phase he is going through and that when he grows up he will be a kind gentle and caring man who puts the best interests of others before his own personal ambitions . that is why in cases of exceptional naughtiness parents should be able to apply for court orders to retrospectively abort their children . mr alois hitler for it is he good evening dear . mrs hitler and that is not all this afternoon i went to put the dinner in the oven and found three little jewish boys in there . he said they are bolshevist sympathisers and that their land rightfully belongs to our family ,1
127,so year do not mess with me or me ideas cus there like so totally righ ,0
128,extend arguments and  ,1
129,think of all gods dead babies ,0
130,a fetus does not no matter how old you are . but you said that killing a human is immoral because they have feelings and interests . yes i agree with all the things you said ,1
131,let us get started ,0
132,i am pro choice and i am excited to hear your opinion ,1
133,as long as the fetus is relying on the mother for nutrients to grow and develop for birth the fetus cannot be removed safely from the protection of the mothers body without dying so there is no way for this to happen . if a mothers life can be saved because the fetus is draining her of too many nutrients inducing labor or removing the fetus would also because the fetus to die just as in abortion so you have contradictory points there . the fetus is not a child yet abortion is not killing a child because the child is self reliant in respect to absorbing nutrients necessary for growth and development while the fetus is not ,1
134,so if we can show that the conditions are appropriate even beyond self defense an abortion can be justified even if it is . opponents of abortion often argue that a fetus has an inviolable right to life . and importantly it also demonstrates that there is no such thing as an ,1
135,there is no problem with you not writing out all other trivial reasons that would make animal killing unjustifiable because those reasons would just be waste of time to mention since we both know what they are and we both understand each other and I am pretty sure our readers imagination is fertile enough to think of other cruel ways to kill animals . again this comes from the bible which i know has no meaning to you so i can easily understand why this point would seem completely ridiculous . it results in whether or not you think it is absolutely necessary for the woman to have an abortion . by showing that your morals contradict i am able to prove my point without discussing the morality of the argument indeed i did not have to go into issues of morality to prove you wrong . the way i manage to avoid the morality of the issue is by taking morals that you already have and using them to my own advantage . honestly I am a bit unclear as to what you mean by this statement . the point is not ridiculous at all even if i do not believe that the bible is always right ,1
136,i say it is a techincal difference so the doctor should just kill it right then outside of the womb . or if we want to add some level of respectiviblity assuming putting the baby back in and then killing it would not count as to respectability . or we could wait a few days or weeks if the baby is viable until a govenor gives the okay and then kill it ,1
137,i guess you did technically answer the question of whether abortion is murder or not but that still does not prove that abortion is  okay ,0
138,for instance let us suppose in this magical country known as a there were  cases of crime or breaking of the law  counts of murder  counts of stealing and  counts of abortion this is really simplified . if i can prove in just one case that abortion lowers crime than the resolution is affirmed while you as con must negate every instance i provide . for my first round i will only post one argument since you do not specify whether i have to provide my entire case in the first round and will not post any argument in the last round . the next year abortion is legalized and there are  cases of crime  counts of murder and  counts of stealing . i will include more arguments for my case in the next round ,1
139,the definition abortion is the act of removing a fetus out of womb . if the fetus is considered a living being then it is a killing of life . case b when it saves life abortion saves life in the following cases rape molestation critical medical condition when mothers life can be saved by removing fetus ,1
140,the man who is dying can not take the other mans heart because the other man is sentient as well and has an equal right to life a right that i agree the dying man can not violate . i feel the man has the right to do so because the monkey is not intelligent in the same way as the man . if a fetus is not self aware in the same way as a living human then why does it have the right to destroy the life of an intelligent living human ,1
141,a fetus still has human instincts it knows how to eat and breathe before it is even born so that idea that a fetus is a brainless piece of non human thing is wrong government should pay for abortion when it is dealing with rape and incest . abortion is just an easy way out for when a woman decides that she had her fun but does not want the responsibly that follows when being a mother . a fetus is a human it has skin organ systems a body is the fetus a human yes a underdeveloped human but still a human ,0
142,the child should not be held responsible for the rapists actions it is not their fault that they were made . the mother can always give the baby to another family member to take care of or put it in an orphanage . its the mothers life that will be affected as well if an unwanted child is born in many cases the woman is not in a position to care for a child either due to financial reasons or personal reasons like the terrifying prospect of raising a child alone ,0
143,it is merciful because you and i both know that somebody born with downs syndrome or prenatal alchohol syndrome or any other of a number of damaging conditions will have a lower quality of life than somebody who does not and because of this it should be legal for mothers to get a do over . however when i say that it is merciful to abort a child that will definitely be born deformed and disadvantaged it is not a remark to me at least on the of that person . but when a woman is raped if abortion is illegal that means she has to first deal with any possible complications during birth which could kill her by the way and even if the birth goes through fine she then has to raise a child who will forever remind her of the time she was violently assaulted and sexually violated . I am talking about victims of rape teenage mothers and babies that through no fault of their own will live hard lives . but i was never talking about the well off responsible loving parents who decide they do not want another child . the big problem with abortion almost is not the practice itself but the controversy around it . a resounding yes and i would go even further to say that they have the right to be born healthy and free of illness and furthermore to be raised by caring responsible and capable parents ,1
144,i guess my only choice is to forfeit this debate . sorry to my opponent that my internet was wacked up . if you would like a redo please contact me ,0
145,i believe that abortion is morally wrong but i do not think the government should be able to take away such personal and close rights to americans no matter what . taking away abortion would violate traditional american ideals and values the basis that this country was built upon . alright i guess since con has forfeited this round and has not expanded on his argument i win ,1
146,yes i do believe my mother had the right to abort me especially because i suffered brain damage at birth due to oxygen deprivation i believe she had more right to have me killed than anyone else infact and a lot of the time i think it would of been better if she did infact kill me ,1
147,i believe that if abortion is to be conducted it must be quick and humane however i find the ideology of you saying people who abort should be put in jail and that people just should not get pregnant to be far too generalized and does not account for many different circumstances that might arise that would make the mother abort . abortion should be legal because someone may have simply been raped and is now with a child that she does not want or simply does not have the financial support to bring up also if the mother is under age say   for argumentative purposes .  and is raped by say a fellow family member not only is there a chance that the child will come out before the  month period that is now increased because of her age but also due to the fact that she is so young and she now has a child with such little genetic deviation that there would be severe birth defects the child ren would have to live with their entire lives ,1
148,so long as this human respects these requirements in others it is rational of you to respect the same it is in short a . neither a parent nor a court has any claim on any of this unless the in question has agreed to a contract to the effect that it does . a human i e a rational being requires certain things for it is existence qua human ,1
149,given this all moral decisions should occur under the over encompassing shadow of this moral guideline since nobody wishes to suffer we should focus on maximizing freedoms while limiting harms so as to bring about the best possible reality for everyone . forcing someone into a physical state against their will when they have done no wrong is a violation of liberty and a great harm . therefore sentience is not the best means by which to determine the morality of abortion because it does not take into account the same level of freedom and harm prevention as the issue of bodily sovereignty does . let us presume that there is a man dying due to a failing heart . but there is something else upon closer observation one will notice . yet this sentience does not give the man justification to violate the bodily sovereignty of the other . in fact whether the fetus is human or not is irrelevant ,0
150,because the unborn child is unseen it is easier for society to condone killing him or her though this is morally indistinguishable from killing any child at any stage of development . in addition abortion does not solve the deeper problems that have contributed to having an untimely pregnancy problems such as low self esteem sexual exploitation unchaste sexual behavior poverty lack of education and absence of moral guidance . finally a society which allows the killing of its most vulnerable members in the very place in all the world which should be for them to be safest and most nurtured their own mothers wombs is incapable of cherishing and nurturing human life or valuing childhood and motherhood ,0
152,in your rebuttal you say just because it is morally wrong to remove an egg and a sperm the egg and sperm fuse upon conception to form  chromosomes and  cell . why would human life in this country be treated as anything other than equal . killing the purest forms of human life is not a line in the future of this country ,0
153,should that be a choice for anyone ,0
154,abortion is just a women getting rid of a part of her body like and appendix but what people do not realize is that people who get abortions are setting the future to what is going to be and people against abortions are living in the times . would not it be better if the future child was not born if it is mother was to young to take care of it . some women were raped and got pregnant because of it and just wanted to get rid of the thought ,1
155,in conclusion i have explained why the mothers life is more important that the fetuses and that in cases where the mothers life is put at risk abortion should be an open option i have explained why it would be morally wrong to allow some babies who have no consciousness and barely any brain activity to suffer through the hardships they will face in life i have explained that illegal abortions will occur and the results will be disastrous if it is not regulated by the government and i have refuted my opponents fetus versus baby contention . in extreme cases such as when the mothers life is put in jeopardy the baby will likely die before any of this could be said about them and often times they will take the rational breathing thinking mother with them . i am talking about when a person has limbs that are underdeveloped and they have no consciousness to begin with and they are simply a financial burden to the family . first and foremost in cases where the life of the mother is at risk there is a large chance that the baby will simply die along with the mother so in predetermined circumstances where it is deemed likely that the baby will put the mothers life at risk it would simply be best to abort the baby no matter the stage of pregnancy as aborting the fetus will likely save the mothers life . it is fairly sad to see and it is best to spare the family the hardship of the countless medical bills and emotional trauma . because of the vague title i did all of this in the assumption that you were talking about all cases of abortion in general . if the mother had two or three children after the initial abortion that could have killed her if she had not gotten it then in the end multiple lives were saved at the cost of having an abortion . it will revolve around three ideas illegal abortions the life of the mother and mental and or physical handicaps of the baby . so instead of simply putting the title abortion you should have probably made it something more like abortion should never be permitted in any case in the united states or abortion should never be permitted in most cases in the united states then you could state the rare exceptions in the first round ,1
156,moral or immoral from one point of view or another asking the government is siding with one over the other pro life must by necessity negate the moral decisions of pro choice . the question then becomes does the government have interest for the sake of society to intervene and control a woman s body without her consent based on one set of morals while excluding another s enforcing by law the sense of moral superiority of one group .  the moral position of one does not necessarily negate the moral position of another in a just society .  greatest happiness the term john stuart mill choose as the grandfather of the concepts of just society has significant interest in this debate . this resulted in much higher infant mortality rates  deaths in   live births more than  before underdeveloped infants  in  babies all the while abortions were still happening illegally increasing adult women s deaths and severer health concerns . pro choice has no interest in forcing their morality on pro life therefore pro choice is a default while pro life must have intervention in personal life choices . starting with the happiness of the women who seek abortion we can pick some important points using a pro life friendly site as a source . the societal impact of removing this choice from the woman has a dramatic and negative impact on the society at large leading to unhappiness . the number of unwanted children became an epidemic a human tragedy that the country still suffers from ,1
157,elimination of abortion altogether is such a morality ,1
158,but even then it is still a human it does not become a human after the premature period of development is done it is a human the whole time ,0
159,they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own . we do not treat peach seeds like peach trees and accordingly we should not treat a fetus like a fully gown human being . by then he will have recovered from his ailment and can safely be unplugged from you . after that period it seems to me that as the fetus gains fully human facilities it should gain increasing moral significance .    this indicates that the decision to attempt to have children leads to the death of many fertilized eggs which according to the pro life position are fully significant individuals . she thinks that answer is clearly no and since the scenario is analogous to abortion you are likewise not morally required to allow the fetus to use your kidneys and other vital organs and are morally allowed to remove the entity . heres the problem when one attempt to have children through normal sexual reproduction it is estimated that only  to  percent of all conceptions advance beyond  weeks of gestation ,1
160,my post this round will be extremely short because my opponent has not given me much to respond to . I am arguing that it is possible to determine if someone will end up like that when they are still in the womb . note that i wrote this last round in my ipad so please excuse the rushed fashion that this was written in and any sloppiness regarding sentence structure and grammar ,1
161,unfortunately my opponent has not clarified what he means by . pro shall have the bop to show that abortion is morally permissable in certain situations . my opponent also simply states his own opinion and commits a bare assertion fallacy ,0
162,resolution in regards to non medical abortion a contract should have to be signed by the mother and father of the fetus stating that they both consent to the abortion . that is all for this round i look forward to this debate and thank whoever accepts it .  arguments  the fetus belongs to the mother just as much as it does the father ,0
163,i not religious but he will forgive those who ask for his repentance . we believe there are many reasons to abort such as fear of having or raising a child rape or not having enough money . some important reasons why women should not abort have to do with human values religious values and values of conscience . well we can discuss the issues of abortions and whether women have the right to do so without consequences for days . these unborn babies should have the privilege to live and grow into a normal person ,1
164,abortion something everyone says is totally right and those who oppose it are wrong but are we ,0
165,justifiable homicide killing without criminal intent just as in self defense we are promised the right to defend ourselves from any top of bodily harm and a fetus is imposing bodily harm on a mother so she has the right to defend herself from the harm presented . the romans used gladiators to fight to the death in the coliseum and even in modern time there are still tribes that kill for pleasure and fun . justifiable homicidal is recognized by the law and is allowed mainly under the promise of self defense as promised to us by the second amendment  murder moralityeven if she gets around the other two contentions she must then show that murdering in general is wrong . there are a great number of traits a fetus must exhibit to be considered a person and not just a  argument from self defensethe fetus by all means is a parasite to the motherparasite an organism that lives on or in an organism of another species known as the host from the body of which it obtains nutriment . a what qualifies something as a person and not a lifecommon characteristics most people share are conscious the ability to feel pain thought and response . resolved a pregnant woman should not always the right to  is the fetus a life or personwe first have to arrive at the fact a fetus is a person and not a life . the main argument in the case of abortion is that it could be considered murder meaning that would be the death of another person ,1
166,nothing changes here all we have done is just pushed back and dumped it on god . that said i never said anything about rape cases . i mean the embryo has done nothing wrong in any case so i do not see how my opponent sees the death of the child as valid . so basically my opponents asserts that we have rights . as for the quotes from carlin and harris they are emotional appeals and they do not actually discredit anything i have said . on the other hand my opponent has made no justification as of to why the abortion should not be considered murder . but all my opponent has presented are assertions about what rights we have . this is why we look to reason and consequence beyond just mere assertion of said rights . no conflict of rights interests in the embryonic period con points that rapists can just assert what rights we have presumably in such a way to allow rape . they can not objectively establish rights and this causes their argument to fall apart . that is why i spent my whole opening argument explaining why being human makes it not okay for the baby to be killed . they have only addressed things said in my rebuttals of their arguments . my whole thing about the death penalty was that not everyone agrees that it should be used at all . my point was that objective rights could only exist with the existence of a god . con can not have it both ways either con assumes such bodily rights exist that make rape kidnapping wrong in which case con can not complain or con continues to deny such bodily rights in which case i argue that con is forced to deny such bodily rights in order to justify their side of the debate . now that they see that that position fails now they are buying into the . but i never really went into specific details because i do not think i have to ,0
167,if abortion is made illegal it will just increase the number of unwanted baby . when a child is born there is a start of new emotional bond between child and family . a child needs a lot other support before he she is ready to live life on its own ,1
168,state your case ,1
169,my opponent has failed to address perhaps the strongest point of my case the fact that an embryo has all human dna that will ever be obtained in its life . an embryo or a fetus has all the possible dna that a human can ever obtain in its lifetime . in circumstances in which the female is at the risk of dying or has been raped abortion is permissible . my opponent also has not stated why the embryo or fetus does not have a right to use the pregnant womens body . consider an alteration of this argument made by jim spiegel   . my opponent has also asked me to prove that if a embryo were a human abortion should be banned . fetus humana human is defined as  a member of the genus homo and especially of the species h sapiensbelonging to a species is determined from the dna of an organism . this point is again a violation of the rules and should be disregarded . my opponent has stated that because an embryo is not conscious it should not be granted rights . the person who randomly woke up with a violinist connected has not been previously aware of any sort of risk that this might happen . the only time that this might not happen is in cases of rape but this has been defined as no part of this debate in round  .  violates rightagain this has all been addressed in the rules of round  . however the concept of human rights in it self requires a certain set of morals to recognize them such as not murder stealing etc . an abortion is clearly a violation of the hippocratic oath and cannot be deemed to continue . it is responsible for the development and growth of mankind . if it does not have a right to do this then all pregnancies should be aborted as it is a violation of the rights of the female .   my opponents  moralitymy opponent is stating the government should have no obligation to enforce morality to human rights . people in a comatose are given rights are not conscious nor viable . when somebody chooses to be subjected to a risk and the risk happens the blame should only be on themselves not the innocent human being inside of them ,0
170,seeing as how the majority of society in the us agrees abortions should be legal the priority for anti abortion people should be to reduce the number and to improve technology to where abortion would not be necessary not to try to ban it against the will of the people . most people do not accept that when you masturbate have nocturnal emissions or have your period you are killing something by way of not fertilizing it . there is no reason particularly if you accept when personhood begins to be at brain activity to deny yourself this . in order to ban abortions entirely you have to sacrifice a lot more than most people think . it is therefore not killing a person to kill a fetus that has not yet undergone brain waves . if you agree with termination on the grounds of rape for mental health reasons why are the physical and mental problems associated with forced pregnancy not a problem for you . in some years over half of the women who got abortions stated they had used some form of contraception prior to having sex . if you draw the line at fertilization conception you have to deal with the fact that many fertilized eggs never attach to the womb . for myself a womans bodily autonomy takes precedent prior to brain activity at the very least . this means if we as a society improve contraception half of all abortions immediately go away to the benefit of everyone . that means one out of every  chances you have to get pregnant will result in pregnancy . so you think all the people who can not find a partner should never have sex . this is more important to me than when life begins . citing contraception as if it is foolproof and everyone who got an abortion should be ashamed is a disastrously I will informed position .  most people who give it thought will conclude that you become a person around when brain activity begins . not everyone wants their children to be put up for adoption . the primary goal of anti abortion people seems to be banning abortions without taking the steps that would make it possible for pro choice people to accept that . if you are being consistent why do you say rape . few would call people who take their parents off life support after brain death to be murderers yet so many believe allowing a woman to terminate a pregnancy before personhood begins is killing a person ,1
171,you know what I am mean bro ,1
172,unfortunately given that i dismantled pros affirmative position and rebutted every criticism pro raised to my own affirmative case against the permissibility of abortion in the last round i have nothing left to respond to ,0
174, my opponent also states pro life if you are not aware means that you believe the government should not only have a say in a womens decision of what is right to do with her body and her child but that it should have the only say .  pro also stated the woman knows more about what is the right decision for her and her baby than someone who will most likely never meet either of them ever will . last time i checked i would not be very happy if my mom aborted me as i would not get the chance to live and experience life . therefore the government does have a place in abortion because it needs to protect the rights of that baby guaranteed by the constitution of the united states .  another statement made by my opponent is i am not quite sure what he is trying to say but it is still no excuse for murder . it falls under the jurisdiction of the preamble and can also be found relate able throughout the declaration of independence bill of rights etc . another item the preamble mentions is securing the blessings of liberty to our posterity . if the definition of posterity is correct as above the baby is entitled to the blessings of liberty . here is the preamble to the constitution of the united states ,0
175, only if you happen to want a child can afford to care for it and are with someone that can help you to raise the child in the best possible way with no health problems nor outside financial time responsibilities .  of course even using protection such as the pill and a condom there is a risk of sexually transmitted diseases including pregnancy but as is with adverse effect they for the most part can be treated or else are being researched in how to treat it . and that can be for many reasons such as having your life threatened the sheer embarrassment the way people think of you having to re live being violated often in front of many people and often more than once for months on end while the trial rages on and many other factors .  some potential parents would not want to put their children up for adoption for the reasons i listed above . did you know that there is a clear alignment between children in foster care and adoption and likelihood of depression and suicide . i understand that this is a very controversial topic and i hope that we can both remain civil and learn from this debate . which is worse a parent looking into the facts and deciding that the least cruel way to deal with it is to stop it from ever suffering as in killing it before it can feel or forcing someone to go through years of being hurt alone betrayed potentially likely abused before likely killing themselves ,1
176,women should have the right to make decisions about their body the government should not be allowed to force a woman to carry a baby and live with the consequences of that for the rest of their life . the government cannot force a woman to make decisions that may harm herself . you are incorrect just because a fetus is part of its mother does not mean i has the same rights ,1
177,people rant about how abortion is so wrong but i feel that they are not looking at it from every angle ,1
179,it is better to kill the baby during pregnancy than to give birth to it and put it in foster care ,1
180,instead the world needs to start funding services to actually support women through pregnancies and make their difficult situations pleasant and make them feel like they are cared about . all governments should stop funding organisations like planned parenthood that do not support women in any way shape or form and manipulate them into using their abortion services to make billions of dollars for the greedy men at the top and murder  million children yearly . if you had ever encountered the child of a rape victim or a woman who carried through with her pregnancy after suffering the horrible injustice of rape you would come to realise that having the child is not as awful as it is made out to be ,0
181,it is possible to choose the gender of your child through sperm seperation if you want to do that . i believe it is sexist and wrong to murder baby girls for their gender . why should gender or race matter whether someone has the right to live ,1
182,in the same way actions that are considered are those that do not reflect the actions of someone who has a relationship with god or at least the judeo christian perception of god . conclusion even if the fetus consents abortion must be regarded as immoral . murder by the definition of morality provided cannot be moral and must be regarded as immoral ,0
183,finally I would like to point out that the overwhelming majority of abortions are due to convenience rather than necessity . but if a woman is raped rather than responding to violence with more violence we should work to help the woman get through such a traumatising experience rather than acting like it did not happen . the fetus simply is growing inside of the woman not like a parasite but in the womb the way they are biologically designed to ,0
184,if the family can only afford to raise one child then they will be forced to live their remaining lives without ever experiencing a wanted birth with a child of the union of their marriage . these laws are like other natural scientific law in that they are simple and obvious yet these abortion related laws have profound impact on the way society should judge the abortion issue . natural laws are self evident once brought to light and backed up with theory . this debate will test a newly revealed natural scientific law that partially governs the impact that abortion has on society . either that or they would be forced to give away a child that is conceived and carried for nine months ,1
185,void you do not have to tell the child he is adopted infants are more likely to be adopted than any other age group anyway . also anybody who is capable of going through the first two trimesters without an abortion does not need one in the third trimester . even if you do not believe abortion is murder you should believe that if at the time you get the abortion the child can be alive that should classify as murder ,0
186,late term abortion is in no way murder the fetus is not fully developed so it has no heart or brain and is not considered a living human and murder is only the killing of one human being by another and is unlawful but abortions are not illegal ,1
187,as for the point concerning unfit parents adoption is absolutely a better option for all parties involved the mother the father the baby and the loving adopting family barring some infinitesimally small percentage of cases that because life threatening deliveries for the mother . i zealously take the opposite position on the matter being persuaded that which i will often for the sake of accuracy refer to as the murdering of a preborn child is quite evil and sinful . the mere concept that it may not be evil could only be considered from a point of subjective morality which is quite problematic in and of itself but that is another debate altogether ,0
188,it is a growing cell and does not even have a consciousness at the time of legal abortion ,1
190,i have been more attentive towards things much more important than this debate as of late and i think that I am going to have to concede ,0
191,look i understand your concern and it was nice being pressured about this kind of topic noting we only had five minutes per round anyways pro choice thank you for the debate ,1
192,look people i do not even get why you should be killing people inside of you ,0
193,it is not a question of the babys health the mother has an absolute right to choose what is living inside her and not ,1
194,you stated giving life to an unwanted child might invite world of troubles for the mom and the child so are we being fair to the child . there would not be any troubles if the mother does not want nothing to do with child she should just give it up for adoption killing a life is like killing a part of you . it has nothing to do with abortion unless she is already pregnant then yea she should be forced to produce a life giving birth is a miracle just because she may not want the baby does not mean she can not give the baby up for adoption because unlike her there are people in the world who may or trying to have a child but can not she is really lucky in many cases she should not kill the baby ,0
195,therefore i will quote from a source why abortion is immoral and should be self explanatory according to marquis abortion is seriously morally wrong because it is an act of killing a being with a right to life and killing a being with a right to life is seriously morally wrong because it robs such a being of its future a future in particular of great value like ours . thank you con minddrag for such a memorable debate . i cannot rebut cons statement in  and he violated his rule ,0
196, fetus argument since the vast majority aborts during the embryonic period I am not sure why we need to debate the fetus biological form since it has no relevance to the illegalization of this practice but I will proceed anyway . fetus not really innocent addressing the theory presented j t stated that even if the embryo fetus has a right to life it does not have a right to use the pregnant womans body so technically the fetus is not at all innocent as it invades the woman s privacy and violates women s rights .  million per year this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion this process is more dangerous expensive and of course unlawful  . that means that the fetus is not fully developed yet  which means that the pregnancy is still in its embryonic period  . there are many scenarios where the mother s life is at risk unless she aborts if we deprive them of aborting we are not only killing the mother but also giving society a bad name . out of those  million how can you say for sure that they did not migrate to other countries or if they even have a decent job or if they died or have an illness . a fetus being human is highly a controversial issue and it will probably never end . my opponent seems to be confusing us with calculations and claims that the usfg could have saved  trillion usd if roe was not decided because  million un aborted people could have lived by now and each would have earned an average of  . furthermore pro must prove that an embryo is still as equal as a fetus or a human being he also needs to show sufficient proof that it is enough to ban them . she says that the right to life does not entail the right to use another persons body and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something the use of your body to which he has no right . women who are raped should not suffer  months of carrying a child she did not want especially if she is poor . since I have shown that illegalizing abortion violates rights and that it poses a danger to women this practice should remain legal . would you want the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector state . utilitarianism a simple definition of utilitarianism is that it determines the moral worth of an action only by its resulting outcome and that one can only weigh the morality of an action after knowing all its consequences  . this is false since he did not give a source I would like to point out that  in  abortions in the us occur in the first  weeks of pregnancy   ,1
198,unlike china the us is not able to simply harvest the organs of prisoners nor the dead without their consent . studies by university of california found that  of the women who are turned away from abortion are likely to become unemployed on welfare compared to the  that have abortions . john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that . us constitution  amendmenta lot of people site the constitution for the but the constiutional fact is that you have to be born in the united states in order for these rights to apply to you . a child that is not wanted and one that would because massive harm as well as dettremental effects to soceity should not have to be born into this world as it would simply just because everyone pain . no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge theprivileges orimmunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any statedeprive any person of life liberty or property without dueprocess of law nordeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .  on top of this the cdc reports that  of all pregnancies are unintended . many people tend to site gun control or many other factors but the real solution was abortion . they are also more likely to stay with their abusive partner leading to a higher amount of domestic violence . so even though it may or may not be alive it is not considered a us citizen hence have constitutional rights until they are born not at conception . this is something that no one men women or children have to be forced to live through ,1
199,well abortion can kill many babies ,0
200, i assume that pro wishes to converge on the question because pro anticipates this would demonstrate that if life is said to exist then objectively it cannot be taken away .  by this argument women must either practice celibacy the only  guaranteed form of contraception well almost if you count the immaculate conception or else risk being the hostages of their reproductive biology up until to the age of final fertility . what the pro finds evil is the execution of the most innocent part of our society for no reason besides the burden they pose . the pro does not want to dive into the benefits of federalism but the main point is that it allows for more direct representation of us citizen s wishes . would this then extend to and cover all forms of human intervention that assists or ends life e g should we take polio vaccines . the con uses faulty logic here and is also assuming what the pro believes with no evidence . the pro also argues that individual men and women have the right to defend their body however they wish as long as it does not encroach on other individual s civil liberties . the pro believes that the unnecessary loss of any human life is a moral evil and a terrible sadness . the pro believes that any execution should never be committed unless there is an existing threat from a guilty individual to another human . this displays that pros side subjectively believes there exist scenarios in which the ending of life by human intervention is sometimes a justifiable action . if the human race does not plant the flag of human value at the conception of life there is no defense against the murder of any individual . the sad and heart breaking act of ending a human life should only be performed when the human being can no longer return to life while not on life support . as to the arguments of human intervention maintaining lives the pro believes that all options should be exhausted for as long as possible to save the endangered life ,0
201,according to a  study published in the scandinavian journal of public health stated that abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression . according to a  chinese study and a  study of women s with abortions on the international journal of epidemiology  both studies found a strong link between abortion and breast cancer . a trend of which breast cancer is more common and mental health is at risk sometimes even turning suicidal  . according to maureen condic phd of neurobiology and anatomy assistant professor at the university of utah states most primitive response to pain the spinal reflex there is universal agreement that pain is detected by the fetus in the first trimester . this brings me to my extension fetuses do feel pain during abortion . so essentially abortions also put a permanent torn on the mother . thus i ve proved to you in this round that a fetuses deserve a right to life b abortions can because later problems for the mother ,0
202, a sperm has  chromosomes and no matter what even though it is alive and can fertilize an egg it can never make another sperm . like cells in someones hair or fingernails an egg or sperm does not have the capacity to become other than what it already is . at what minute can one consider life to be worthless and at the next minute that life to be precious .  once there is the union of a sperm and egg the  chromosomes are brought together in one cell with  chromosomes . this new life is not a sperm or an egg or even a simple combination of both .  see heres the problem when we begin to save things from their potential to be something it goes into the ridiculous . both are essentially dead ends destined to remain what they are until they die in a matter of days ,1
203,for someone to hold a person body hostage to drain them of resource and comfort against their will even someone who is life may depend on that body is not right . fetus may be lives and they may even be lives worth protecting but they do not get special rights to use another persons body against there will . even in death what happens to ones body is the right of each individual ,1
204,the nearest abortion clinic is a few hundred miles away in another city another city that you cannot travel to considering the fact that your car has been repossessed . however in the status quo abortion clinics can be hard to find in some areas such as mississippi or north dakota and state legislatures are constantly trying to pass new bills that would make abortion clinics even rarer . in our world when women have too little access to abortion clinics because they are not close enough to where they live tragedies like this happen in places with harsh regulations on abortion abortion clinics might not even be built forcing women to travel elsewhere to end unwanted pregnancies . with abortions mothers lives could be saved from complications that would otherwise arise from continuing on with the pregnancy such as severe infections heart disease or stroke .  diy abortions are harmful to the health of women because they are not conducted by trained professionals and are often unsanitary . this means that many women wishing to have an abortion would have to travel long distances to get one which makes abortions practically inaccessible for poorer women who cannot afford such travel the same women who abortions would likely benefit . signpost in order to demonstrate why my proposal must be put in place i first demonstrate that abortions benefit society and then analyse why knowing that we must use this proposal to make it more accessible ,1
205,as far as protecting killers goes i think life in prison is a pretty bad way to live out your years and i think people who actually commit murder deserve harsh punishment . i have shown that  hypocrisy is to profess to believe something that you do not actually believe or practice this is not a characteristic of the people my opponent is intent on villifying .  if we had a standard for the death penalty like any type of murder results in the death penalty which is to be carried out within a year or after their first and only appeal . you can not refute any of my arguments so you misrepresent them and then call them evil . if a black man kills person x he is  more likely to get the death penalty than if a person of another race were to kill person x understand .  not sure what your point is here but i have provided facts and statistics to show that the application of the death penalty that is racially biased .  saying that  people could have been wrongfully executed is not a reflection of the death penalty in any way .  the death penalty is a penalty it is not a random thing they do not pull people off the street and execute them on a whim . the only countries that execute more people than the usa are china pakistan iran iraq and the sudan  . a house plant is alive but if i cut it down that does not make me a murderer . here is a quote from the page you cited on average two countries per year have abolished the death penalty since  the year it was abolished in canada . i can say that if we outlaw violent video games murder rates will drop but that does not make it true .  in the process of making his arguments my opponent has praised such oppressive entities as the chinese government for killing more of its own citizens than the rest of the world combined .  there are logical reasons to believe in both positions and doing so does not make one evil immoral or hypocritical . people who hold these views only say that they support a womans right to choose and that the death penalty is unjust for the various reasons i have previously stated ,1
206,for all the reasons i stated above we to defer to that putative person as a person because there is too many compelling reasons not to . for all the reasons i stated above we treated that putative someone as a person but recognize the various factors in consideration and not punish . but when it comes to potentially harming a putative someone else it becomes an issue for society ,0
207,yo how you doing i liked taking a poo right now ,1
208,if this were the case then why is killing infants under three years of age illegal . or how about the legality of slavery in the  and prior . infants that young after all have not developed logic or full use of their brains yet . i would now like to end this debate by saying that just because it is legal does not mean it is right . the fact is that brains spinal cords heart and other organs start development at the third week after conception ,0
210,women have the moral obligation to carry an unborn child women are morally obligated to provide for a child during pregnancy for the following reasons absolute dependency one of these reasons is that the child has absolute dependency on the mother . since it is the duty of the government to create laws that protect our unalienable rights and it is the moral obligation of human beings as a whole to protect unalienable rights i declare that abortion should therefore be illegal . the government fails in it is duty to respect the most important of unalienable rights and since the government s duty is to uphold these rights the government should therefore make abortion illegal . that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . now most of my opponent s arguments rested on the fallacy that unalienable rights are subjective and that since we as a people have no right .   we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness . in both cases the person who desires to take the life of another is denied because they conflict with our unalienable rights . it has already been shown that life begins at conception and seeing that true the right to life has been granted to the unborn child .  to force laws among other people then women still retain the freedom to have an abortion whether that choice is moral or immoral . conclusion to take the child s life is to value the ease of your own life over the unalienable rights of the unborn child . women have the moral obligation to provide for an unborn child this section will finally focus on how humans have a moral obligation to provide for those who have absolute dependency on you in order to fully respect our human dignity and the right to life ,0
211,extend all arguments ,0
213,now the question to abort the baby is a difficult issue also i am a man and do not fully understand the emotions of a woman who have been raped it goes without saying she should not have a living breathing reminder of that experience . a woman who is raped and impregnated should not be forced to have that baby . with that being said many will argue that the child should not have to pay for the sins of the rapist but no one should have to raise a child born from an unfortunate event like that ,1
214,no problem kohai ,0
215,definitionsabortion a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy and because the death of the fetus  immoral not morally good or right      rebuttalsno excessive argumentation regarding semantics . he seems quite convinced that abortion is morally justifiied so i anticipate a lively intellectual discourse with him .  to a debate regarding the morality of abortion ,0
216,i believe that abortion should not be legal one bit i do not believe that murder is right at all but if abortion is legal why do not they legalize killing people ,0
217,she was in tears at this moment explaining that she was at a party a couple of weekends ago and she had blacked out . i could not let my girlfriend get an abortion just because some a hole slipped something in her drink at a party . i asked her if she had taken a pregnancy test already and she said no so we went and got one . rules you must give your person a name and state whether you are male female and what their role is gender male role boyfriend name johnny i was at my girl friends house yesterday and she said that she needed to talk to me about something so i said . i will be debating the part of the male sense i am against the topic being stated ,0
218,it is difficult to elaborate without knowing what my opened means by force and as this is  round debate i will allow him the next round to clarify . it is not justifiable for example the punch a woman in the face to prevent her from going to an abortion clinic and in such places where abortion is legalised it is just plain stupid to think that such an action is justifiable . my opponents argument is that it is justifiable to use force as this has not been elaborated on I am going to assume it is against the mother or maybe even the doctor because killing a fetus is in the eyes of my opponent is essentially killing an innocent person the prevention of which is deemed morally necessary ,1
219,thank you for the debate and may i ask you to be more clear for example are we talking about legalization of abortion or is abortion excusable this would be much appreciated ,1
220,my job here is done  personally i would never abort a fetus because of an unplanned pregnancy but that is just me .  if you agree here then it sounds like i have already changed your mind . nonetheless this was not my argument for  ,1
221,after she kills the child she says she had the right to kill it because it could not feel pain and that it was her body even though it was not this is the same thing that is anyone that aborts a baby under  weeks is doing . after  weeks the baby can feel pain this is confirmed by scientific studies the studies also say that the fetus may can feel pain more intense than after being born . this is my argument of why we should not abort babies that may not can feel pain . i disagree anesthetics may be given to the fetus but i believe it would not block the pain of being destroyed . that a mother has the right to kill her baby even if it causes extreme pain to thebaby ,0
222,it would not really matter if what the sperm are doing is moral since in this example they are not sentient yet but still have the rights of babies .  compared to states that support women s health those states that oppose safe and legal abortion spend far less money per child on a range of services such as foster care education welfare and the adoption of children who have physical and mental disabilities so they are saving money . however it is the principle of the matter that counts so for the sake of agreement let us say the bomb will blow up one person . however the sperm in this case are competing for a common resource they would all need to become sentient ex people competing for food and do not automatically have the right to it in the way that people do with the suns rays . you argue that abortion only endangers the lives of   women and that it decreased .  it would not be fair to force him to die over this and it would not be fair to force someone to get blown up when they have  responsibility in the matter . pro says that the example would be applicable if joe invited the terrorist into his house which would mean women could not get an abortion in cases where they consent to sex . in fact pro has only defended bodily autonomy in the case of rape where it means either the mother or the fetus will die . in one case something is naturally developing whereas in the other one a sperm is actively taking a resource for itself .  if the terrorist as terrorists often do forced his or her way into the space station and used violence to place this bomb in joes hand surely it would not be fair to force him to die over this . in other words since the sperm all depend on fertilizing the egg in order to become sentient it is not immoral for them to fertilize it . saying joe is allowed to do this is basically saying it is fine to allow terrorists to set up bomb triggers on your property and then set them off yourself so long as the reason you are killing someone is to save your life . if there is excess food and one person hoards it all to themselves it is immoral ,1
223,religion noun a set of beliefs concerning the because nature and purpose of the universe especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies usually involving devotional and ritual observances and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs . federal adjective pertaining to or of the nature of a union of states under a central governmentdistinct from the individual governments of the separate states . moral adjective of pertaining to or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong ethical ,1
224, the government ought to base laws upon the principle of  the banning of abortion would be because more happiness to the parties involved than the permitting of it .   it goes without saying that the governments purpose is to create a stable society otherwise it has no substantial role . considering that the government ought to create a stable society it follows that the principles that are most conducive to a stable society are the principles upon which the government ought to create its laws .   in other words when the government makes laws it ought to maximise the happiness and minimise the unhappiness of all beings that are affected by the law . note that this rests upon the fair assumption that life generally contains more happiness than unhappiness as otherwise we would have no reason to not all commit suicide right now . i argue that this law ought to be enforced by the government because its existence promotes a greater net happiness for the parties involved than what would otherwise be promoted if this law did not exist .  the ethical foundation for what is and is not permitted goverment is defined as the group of people with the authority to govern a country or state a particular ministry in office . this is because utility is essential to all human existence and living and hence it is the most prudent principle upon which to make laws . furthermore society will be most stable if the laws are based upon the same foundation as peoples personal morality which is based upon the principle of utility since there would be less dissension ,0
225,people make choices all the time so this should not be surprising to anyone that sometimes a person may change their mind on the idea on abortion . i will instead use this time to elaborate on the claim and hope my opponent engages me . if an abortion does not work then the person in question has the choice to attempt the abortion again which happens in many cases ,0
226,promote a change in legal status of the fetus to person hood . actively oppose euthanasia and or right to die legislation  . thus pro life adherents oppose any and all assisted death ,1
227,start with all rights and have them limited from top downthe first option here is patently absurd since it would require legislating and permitting each and every action that one could ever conceivably take and yes that includes actions we have yet to think about . clearly in neither of these cases is there any scope for consent yet prohibiting abortions as the resolution demands would entail a woman being forced to carry her attacker s estranged partner s child to full term while already under significant psychological trauma and then be forced to raise said child for the next two decades . in order to protect the liberty for all then restrictions need exist however with my arguments i will affirm that these impingements do not apply to all human pregnancy cases . identitya person has a sense of identity or being me and while it is also most likely true for other beings for which it is deemed acceptable such as livestock this is a necessary qualifier for having freedom and liberty . for example a foetus s cell types is virtually undifferentiated until the forth week where the first cells begin to form what is necessary for the brain with the last component the corpus callosum not emerging until the  day . while it may be considered immoral to withhold such donations or treatments this is the price we pay to have adequate liberty for a functional and stable society . given these negative effects on autonomy health and health risks it follows that it cannot be expected of a mother to carry a child to term against her own will . by restricting abortion we essentially drive the practice underground with illegal abortions becoming prominent these abortions lack the safety controls and health considerations that legal abortions have with brutal methodologies such as beating a woman s abdomen piercing the amniotic sac with a sharp object e g coathangers and the use of makeshift poisons .  i can accept pro s general axiom that a government must enable a stable society in order to exist thus if a government is to exist then it must provide this society in one manner or another and human liberty is demonstrably an excellent manner of accomplishing such . memory valueschildhood amnesia is well established in the literature and it is well known that children do not retain knowledge or memories before  years of age well after the age at which abortion is possible this ties in with my identity argument in that the only thing which allows one to identify as themselves is their memory of their previous state . thus under no circumstances does a human foetus qualify as a being to which we need to consider the liberty of thus a minimal government lacks sufficient reason for prohibiting abortion for these reasons ,1
228,if they are deemed mature competent with reasonable understanding of their actions then they are looked at similar to an autonomous person with valid choices . thanks opponent i do not believe abortion is essential to the health of a pregnant minor i do believe abortion is essential to the health of a pregnant minor if it is deemed necessary by a physician in the case where the patient will face severe complications if the pregnancy is not aborted i do agree with my opponent that there are risks associated with abortion such as the ones outlined by my opponent i am certain physicians balance the benefits and costs before suggesting abortion thus when medical abortion is suggested it is to the benefit of the patient i do not agree with my opponent that parents know when an abortion is necessary more than doctors do the question of family morals is a different issue . outcome  if the daughter has no competence in regards to her condition future and accepting the medical treatment then the parents are abusing their daughter by not accepting the medical treatment and jeopardizing their daughters life . the mother does not agree with physicians that d needs to undergo medical treatment . since the daughter can not comprehend her situation and the parents decision is not in the best interest of the daughter ,1
229,with a rape victim it is not her fault but if a girl is sleeping with every guy in school and she knows the consequences but does not care and gets pregnant she should have to deal with the consequence .  she may even be spiteful that she is being forced into carrying an unwanted child for  months . she knew that there was a possibility of getting pregnant but she obviously did not care ,0
230,there should still be a law stating that you have to have it with in so long before the baby starts to develop . after a certain point you should not be allowed to do it . i believe that the women holding the kid should have the right to decide if they want a abortion or not ,1
231,i believe abortion is wrong because abortion is not some women got raped or something and does not want to be reminded of it for nine months most of the time it is some one got pregnant and did not want to be so they kill the child for their mistake i wish a good debate to my opponent but i just do not see how you can agree with killing a child and taking it from its life just because the parents do not want it they are not disposable and abortion is not birth control and even if a women is raped its still going to effect her for the rest of her life anyway so why make the child suffer for a adults mistake and if the parents do not want it put it up for adoption abortion is pointless and unnecessary why take life from an unborn child for nothing ,0
232,contrary to what many pro death i refuse to use the term pro choice people believe abortion is not always used by women who have been raped or children born of incest . I am sorry to make such a bold analogy but i feel it is true the similarities between pro death and pro nazi rhetoric are astounding when you really stop to look at it . i believe that human life is worth protecting even if it is just an unborn fetus ,0
233,if a mother were forced to give birth to her unwanted baby she would clearly still not want the baby . in your particular situation it would at first seem unethical to abort the baby if both lives can be saved . in another scenario the extra mouth to feed can because the family to grow more impoverished ,1
234,my adversary claims that abortion should not be legal as we can see by the topic . she then changes the resolution so that abortion should support cases where it could because danger to someone . therefore extend all resolutions because she conceded that should should be legal in some circumstances and because of the remaining points that were dropped ,1
235,i accept this argument ,0
236,until then there are just cells not a baby or even a fetus . if you are in an abusive relationship and in no position to be bringing a life into this world you have still having that baby . if a little girl is raped she is having that baby ,1
237,debate frameworkit seems to me that pros use of implies that the main concern for both of us should be the moral implications of our views . I have actually been wanting to debate abortion again for a while so it is great to get this opportunity . as such the focus of the debate per pros insistence will be primarily on its general use and not on extreme cases like anencephaly and so on ,0
238,i will allow him one more chance to rebut ,1
239,in the family who can only afford to raise one child you are assuming the parents did not grow to love the child . now considering that there is no other life at stake but the life of the unborn child already conceived what right does this give us to take the life of the child in order to conceive one that is wanted . a lot of parents of unwanted children do love the child as if they were wanted . i have successfully refuted the resolution on three counts by his own admission this is not a new law . on his own articles for the abortion law in question he states . i should also note that these alleged abortion laws are very disputable and most of them are not laws but opinion . you have to answer the question of why it is acceptable to take an unborn childs life to conceive another child . the first law if a woman is forced to carry to term one fetus then she cannot normally become pregnant with another fetus in the same time period .  this means that you would probably be aborting the child in vain since it is not very likely she will get pregnant in that nine month span she would be pregnant with the unwanted child . one theory is that forcing birth of an unwanted child denies life to another potential child . simply because the child is unwanted is not a valid reason . it is not everyday i get to debate with someone who has actually written a book on the topic . i know that can be hard but is not this a better alternative than having the child killed . it just seems wrong to me to kill a life that is here to make way for a life that may or may not happen in the span of the next nine months . also in forcing birth a violation of the occurs that condemns the woman to risk her life in pregnancy with a  in   chance of dying and also forces her to the life of her wanted child ,0
240,unborn babies are still babies ,0
241, might not sound like much but the government regulates about  billion dollars of taxes every month ,0
242,while it is true you cannot kill someone just for trespassing as the punishment must be proportion to the crime the unborn childs life requires that trespass and the mother has an absolute legal right to evict the unborn baby from her body ,1
243,abortion must be part of gods will if he created you with plans to have the abortion . if god created all of us and already knows what were going to choose and do because he created it all that way . god has a divine plan that he made before any of us were alive  . so if it is a sin and all sins are the same why is it so bad to sin be forgiven and have your child directly go to heaven . the souls of aborted children still get to go to heaven and be with god . it is said in the bible if you sin and ask for forgiveness no matter what the sin is you will be saved and forgiven . it also states we were all born sinners and need to accept jesus as our savior to get into heaven ,1
244,being against abortion means that you think it should be completely illegal no matter what situation you may be put into ,1
247,the  amendment says that people are citizens by being born in the us because you can know when someone is born not when they are conceived and it does not deprive protections to people not born in the us it only guarantees them to those who are . if i went to china and murdered someone then came back to the us and got caught I would get arrested even though it was not an american citizen . abortion reduces crime no corelation is not causation besides i could point out a different coorelation which shows the opposite in switzerland the abortion rate is  ,0
248,first of all i apologize for not posting anything i have been quite busy ,0
249,there is no clear and simple answer as to when a babys life starts and neither of us are qualified to make that assumption nor is any other non divine being on this planet . those women in the first  months will eventually be in their  so why is it worse or better . what were really arguing about her is weighing why early and late term abortions are different and in reality how ever you tihnk of aboritons they really are not different at all ,1
250,also i believe that abortion is a human right as if a person is not mentally financially prepared then that child will not have a proper upbringing in that family . what if that woman becomes pregnant and when that child is born every time she sees that child she is reminded of the trauma she suffered . a practice of which a man sexually penetrates a woman without consent ,1
251,accepted and thank you for this debate right let us begin . abortion kills a innocent baby do not make the child suffer for something that you did . the child can be given up for adoption and not murdered torn to pieces ,0
252,and a  year old cannot reproduce but i think we can agree that they are alive . by teaching teens to be responsible to be careful and to think about making any decisions that could result in a pregnancy we can lower the rate . the murder of a pregnant woman can be counted as a double homicide yet an abortion of the same child would be considered fine . many statistics fight the number as   to   annually even though that number was revealed to be false by dr . finally i would like to say that our society already considers the unborn to be persons . and yes women should be able to control their bodies although i did mention before that no one is allowed complete bodily autonomy but a fetus is not part of the womans body . I am sure you would agree that pregnant women do not have four arms and legs or two sets of internal organs . the illegal abortion was an interesting point but the unsafe abortions occur primarily in countries that do not have advanced medical technology . being pregnant is not a punishment for having sex it is simply to result of an action that was designed purely for that purpose . according to mary calderone who was a president of planned parenthood only  people died in  due to any kind of abortion . we know as well that a fetus can respond to stimuli and a fetus grows to its environment an adapts during birth to a new environment ,0
253,and why is that charge only predicated on the wishes of the prosepctive mother ,1
254,but please since you started the debate you make the first argument sir madam and i will respond in kind with a rebuttal and counter argument ,1
255,according to the marriam websters dictionary a human is a bipedal primate mammal homo sapiens man broadly hominid hu man like listen to the pronunciation of humanlike m n l k adjective and it defines a fetus as an unborn or unhatched vertebrate especially after attaining the basic structural plan of its kind specifically a developing human from usually two months after conception to birth and the definition of develop we can look at  a to go through a process of natural growth differentiation or evolution by successive changes b to acquire secondary sex characteristics now to argue my opponents case . a few more things my opponent should consider before his rebuttal  . what one must realise and what will help in my point against my opponents abortion claim is that there are enumerated rights and prenumbral rights . now let us go to how griswald could even have rights in the first place . from  ct had a law that made it a crime punishable by fine or prison to use distribute or advise the use of contraception . so the court was claiming that marital privacy is a penumbral constitutional right implied in the     and  amendments . should we arrest women who have abortions preformed so they will not die during labor have massive physical damage or psychological damage . to have full american rights you must first be an american citizen . should we not preform abortions on a fetus that is grotesquely abnormal ,0
256,therefore as pretty much all human beings have a future life with the capacity to be desirable and that killing is the removal of this future life then we can conclude that the killing of human beings is wrong . note that i will make the following concession that i accept that abortion should be legal in cases where it is necessary to save the mother from death or severe physical injury . furthermore if one was to be diagnosed with cancer and given  weeks to live probably the main reason why the patient would feel saddened would be that they feel disappointment with the prospect of missing out on a future life . the us senate report on senate bill  summarised this premise physicians biologists and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being a being that is alive and is a member of the human species .  of abortions legal to allow for such a negligible minority of cases especially considering that in every single one of these cases a human life is destroyed unjustly . it is a hard question as many take it as indisputable fact that homicide is wrong but it seems that there must be a particular reason why we all share this sentiment . this is demonstrated by how people often mourn the dead by saying he had so much to live for . in other words if there are two actions x y then if y causes a general decrease in the welfare of the involved parties then y is immoral . now consider that the role of government is to promote the welfare of its citizens as it is democratically elected by them ,0
257,but when a human life is the subject of the question it is still a heinous act to condemn that child to a death before it was even properly born . i am sure we can all agree that life on this planet humans more so than any is protected and cherished . no matter whether or not it cannot voice it is own defense and is spoken for by the mother it is a protected human life . by inference it would also be a crime to the developing child and end it is life sadly before it even got to see the bright of the world . well to introduce my views i will not be using anything quoted from religion or from the bible and i myself am not religious in any way ,0
258,i do not think it matters the timeline of proof i have shown . I am just trying to say there is a way a father male were to have a right to choose just as much as the mother female could . this was a fun debate i appreciate it and thank my opponent ,0
259,thank you for accepting considering i have already made a point i wish to give you an oppurtunity to present your first point before i proceed ,0
260,i uh oh uh uh uh i uh well played ,0
261,if you define personhood genetically a fetus is as much a person as you or i and entitled to the same fundamental rights . if you went hunting and you had because to think that there may be a person hiding in a bush you would be morally and legally responsible if you fired into that bush and killed a person . even if you disagree with this definition of personhood you have to wonder about it ,0
262,final statementi think i have made some solid arguments in favor of abortion and responded to my opponent with respect a willingness to review learn and argue accordingly based on what could be established and or reasonably argued . in total i made  contentions  importance of group  human  societal and individual  reduction in criminal  access to abortion reduces infantacide a human rights violationsplease take time to review each of my contention from the beginning and attempt to follow them through the rounds and i hope those who read the debate enjoyed it and also find my arguments more convincing . mandatory waiting periods and parental consent laws by making unprotected sex acknowledged problem to avoid may have effects that reduce risky sexual behavior of teens which can continue into adulthood . having it strongly implement in social and sex education programs could possibly reduce the reasons given for an unintended pregnancy thus a possible reduction is the number of potential abortions  felt they could not get pregnant at the time of conception .  by reducing some of the reasons women give for having an abortion will in turn reduce some of the abortion that might have otherwise taken place . available safe access to highly regulated abortion programs with evaluations and up to date educational programs can even reduce abortions . conclusion abortion is favoredconclusion elaborated on people will commit infanticide for a number of reasons including but not limited to their ability care for the child want of the child or forced participation with group etc human rights are granted to a person upon birth according to international law therefore once a child is born and infanticide is committed this is a violation of that child s human rights ,1
263,not forced but just made aware that her unborn child can live its life being loved by a mother who never had the opportunity she has . by three months the unborn child goes from being called an embryo to a fetus meaning that it now has limbs and such .  and even if that is your true motive why should one woman get to force another woman to have a baby for her . those children that are older have a choice already on how they choose to live and if they want to be adopted to a certain family or person where as those unborn children don t . not require and not trying to fix only trying to save the lives of those  million aborted babies that had no say in there unlived lives . not all women are comfortable with fertility treatments and would rather just adopt a baby they can raise as their own .  number of married women ages   that are infertile unable to get pregnant for at least  consecutive months  . i doubt that your belief is based on the thousands of women who can not conceive . i wasn t really going for terms but if you want to get technical the unborn child ,0
264,now as for the occasional mothers who willingly want babies and decide to abort or mothers who have unprotected sex and get preggo and need to abortion then well that is a different matter but again it is a choice and needs to stay that way even if it is stupid . also did i mention most of these children end up being on the wrong side of the law . why should a female who is been raped at let us say age  or age  any age rather have to carry the burden of having a unwanted baby from a total stranger . well regardless if the fetus is a human at any rate abortion should be considered and be choice . i find it injustice more so on the female who is been raped if she were not allowed an abortion ,1
265,the court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and with scarcely any reason or authority for its action invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes ,1
266,it is irresponsible to ignore any of the above reasons ,1
267,i affirm the right of the woman to use contraception . if she does not want a baby she needs to use contraception . my debate partner is accusing me of forcing my beliefs on others ,0
268,after the abortion she can have severe abdominal pain which can affect you from standing up . your taking the life of an innocent human being which can be considered commiting a crime . cervix and organ damage can affect the possibilty of having children ,0
269,the opposition has stated a belief and has used no facts analysis logic or basic reasoning to why you the readers should take on his point of view .  i brought up the negative impact that unsafe households have on children and here is an article from the daily mail which cites studies which clearly state there is a profound affect on children being in violent families finally a pro adoption page posted an opinion piece about why adoption and abortion are not related and should not be used as alternatives to the other . i do not advocate for people to always get abortions i only advocate for the ability to consent about what they do once they are in this situation . the second points purpose was to illustrate the idea that it is moral to have an abortion . you did directly address my philosophical side of the argument by saying you do not believe in it . my opponent claims that the first point is meaningless however what point is there to proving that an abortion is moral if i do not prove that there are reasons why people need it to be moral . in fact peter signer actually mentions these group that fall under his theory and he supports the idea that they are not a person in that state . the first point gives good reasons to why a potential parent should be given a choice based on the fact that this is a life changing event that some do not want forced onto them . this is a great question and is the downfall of many people who are pro abortion supporters because they are unsure how to respond to this . more methods need to be put in place to prevent this situation from occurring at all . to be fair you did provide to analogies to where the theory would also apply but you did not provide any reasons to why these scenarios disprove the theory . in stead of replying to that you claimed that i did not cite sources something you seem to believe is quite important . women are not going out there to get an abortion for the sole purpose to kill a child there is a large decision making process ,1
270,or what if a  old gets raped and will most likely not make it through child birth also she should not have to deal with the disapproving stares of strangers when her pregnancy is far along ,1
271,i adamantly believe in the pro choice ethos . yours sincerely bem  . i will challenge you in this debate ,1
272,hell yeah it should be banned its murder simple ,0
273,so back to the argument at hand the point i was trying to make is that murder is the conscious ending of someones human life for malicious reasons like hate or apathy but if we decide that fetuses are human since they are technically alive and part came from a human or excuse me is in a human then following that logic should not sperms and eggs be kept in the same regard as a human . it is wrong to legalize a rule that states all pregnant woman must give birth to their child since the raped women did not have a choice in its conception . first off when a woman is violated sexually raped and the man fails to deploy any birth control method such as condoms or medication for the woman she most likely becomes pregnant . if this is so why can not sperms be considered humans as well . you can not just throw them into a garbage can leave them lying on your bed or throw them into a toilet ,1
274,if you got pregnant there is no other way of ensure that you will no longer be pregnant than abortion . now i also understand the people who have been raped and ended up pregnant and cannot bear to have a child but in the instance of rape and incest proper medical care can ensure that a woman will not get pregnant . if someone rape you and you got pregnant there is no way proper medical care can ensure you will not get pregnant you have already got pregnant ,1
275,so in essence you have no logical reason you are simply deferring to a book . since one cannot reasonably apply their own personal religious ideals to the whole of humanity i believe you have failed to make your case . you have not offered a single reason as to why it is wrong other than . reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life sometimes described as an or iv .  if you cannot care for a child you can choose the following  not to have sex  prevent fertilization  adoption . intent to inflict grievous bodily harm short of death iii .  even if you say there is no harm done in this logic there is nothing wrong with killing a person in a coma ,1
276,abortion should be something everyone can agree with because if a woman is raped and does not want a baby she should be able to get an abortion so she will not have to be forced through motherhood ,1
277,that is ageist to imply that you have to be a certain age or developmental milestone to be a person ,0
278,it should therefore not only be unavailable but criminal ,0
280,a second situation where i think abortion would be desirable would be in the case of rape victims who are impregnated through no fault of their own . the mother would no doubt be scarred for life emotionally and as such may not be able to treat her offspring in the way in which it deserves to be treated . imagine the emotional purgatory which would result from being raised as an only child and then being told that you never got to know your father because he was a rapist who brutally attacked the person who raised you ,1
281,you are supposed to be arguing that you are not for the abortion of children based on their sex however it would seem as if you are . it is possible to choose the gender of your child through sperm seperation if you want to do that . i believe it is sexist and wrong to murder baby girls for their gender ,0
282,abortion is just not practical what is the point in killing your offspring inside of its carrier ,0
283,abortion doctors similarly might be challenged by the process of an abortion and even believe that they are the fetus but nevertheless acknowledge the need for abortions and so are comfortable with their profession ,1
284,definitions abortion is defined as the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy usually during the first  weeks .  maximum  arguments and rebuttals are allowed .  forfeiting means an automatic loss unless deemed okay by both sides ,1
285,life is a series of decisions choices we make all the time every minute of everyday this is only one small decision . either way it does not matter to me what you want to call it i call it making a decision . friends and sources are telling me you can not be murdered until you receive a birth certificate have been born into this world and declared a human being ,1
286,breaking this rule is an automatic forfeit i as con need not provide a case only rebut pros ,0
287,and third women will not have to undergo the unbearably painful experience of child birth until they are ready .  i am not necessarily saying that third trimester abortions would be either good or bad in regards to the economy personal liberties or the quality of life . is it good national policy for force all females to serve as hosts to these sentient parasites . imagine if the government decided that you only need half of that to survive and so takes that pay check away from you and then spends it on food to feed people in darfur .  so to repeat argument  third trimester abortions are good for the economy personal liberties and quality of life .  let approach this debate from another angle . since sentient life is more important than the quality of life we should have just let black people keep slaving away at the plantations as long as their slave masters only beat them and not kill them ,1
288,none of this introduction business let us just get down to the real stuff debating ,0
289,so go on ahead and throw these at me and let us get real and down to facts ,0
290,the reason most of do not compare the killings of the usa army to nazi germany is that we realize there are morally relevant factors that apply or do not apply to different situations and thus one situation even though they may have some things in common even killing does not necessarily mean they are morally equivalent . none of pros arguments can change the one simple truth of it all killing is wrong once again the double standard is shown . more than  of all abortions are simply done by women who do not want to live with the consequences of their actions . i take it con drops this moral equivalency argument in light of my counters . the point is not even the pro life anti choicer believes in such a simplistic absolute right to life and if such a person was to selectively apply such an absolute right to life to justify denying an abortion would be a double standard hypocritical . i maintain that the absolute right to life right not to be killed premise is untenable and cons argument against abortion rests upon this flawed selectively applied premise and thus should be rejected . when it comes to killing in other areas well there are morally relevant factors at play and in case xyz killing is not or may not be wrong . what i rebuked con for is using forced continuation of pregnancy as some sort of punishment and the implication if such a woman gets an abortion they are getting away with something . the right to life right not to be killed is often invoked as justification for not allowing abortion ,1
291,round  acceptance round  openings round  refutations round  conclusion abortion the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy most often performed during the first  weeks of pregnancy ,0
292,my opponent makes the claim that sometimes an infants rights should be prioritized . and at that time the care and well being of the child is transferred to the state . another person does not have any rights over the use of her body at any time . infants should not be afforded special rights over another person simply because they are infants . but it does not have the right to life by violating another persons rights ,1
294,at the point where a fetus is viable it is certain that it is a person and deserves all the rights and duties afforded to any other human . however after praising that idea my opponent does not reject the idea that a law shod be instituted that would make it illegal though not pursuable for a woman to have an abortion . even if a person engages in risky activity by livin in a dangerous neighborhood and leaves her door open or has sexual intercourse without protection if a burglar enters that persons house or an egg is fertilized the person is in no way obligated ot facillitate the needs of the burglar or provide a comfotable home for a fetus for nine months . my opponent is going to try in his last attempt to defend his position that the law is not enforcable and therefore the consequences of this law are not as i portray them . so with the preceding conclusion that you the judge are going to vote for the con let me further explain why abortion should not only be legal in the first trimester but is also morally permissible . and at the point where we recognize that it would be unjust for a government to enforce a law of such kind we must reject the idea of a ceremonial law that states the same thing illegal . a persons sovereignty over their own body rtrumps any right to life an unfeeling clump of cells has even if you afford that clump of cells the exact same rights as a human being a point that my opponent has failed to argue . in the case of abortion it cis clear that if a fetus is not a person because it lacks viability during he firt trimester we must agree that the act of abortion does not infringe uon the rights of anotherhuman being . however as my opponent would like to consider those his arguments we can go from there ,1
295,final comments at the end of the day i admit that my opponents arguments from an empirical perspective do show that in this physical world with our laws culture society and police force that our quasi legalized abortion certain kinds are not legal depending on country does not reduce crime or at least is unknowable . therefore in an abstract sense an elimination of a law such as on abortion would result in less crime according to its definition in this debate . however one of the problems of this resolution is that it is somewhat unclear . this would do nothing to refute my argument since it is metaphysical . furthermore certain crimes are taken for granted such as theft i will explain what i mean here later on ,1
296,true older parents do not live as long but there is always a better choice than death and as for physical effects if you are not willing to take some pain or die for your own blood that is pathetic . now as for somebody not knowing someone you do not need to know someone go on line to find a group that will help you pick a family for your child before it is born and also spanking them or giving them shots or circumcised that helps them later in life it dose not end there life and people that have a tuff life enjoy life more when something good happens . still i do not think kids should be having sex they have meds for stress and depression plus sex is not made for enjoyment or to help with problems its for reproduction between a man and a women for a child to be made and for nothing else ,0
297,first off i would like to thank my opponent for challenging me in this debate topic ,1
298,so in conclusion things pro needs to answer at what stage does it become murder to kill a fetus . is the fetus any less alive than it was the day before seeing that pro has already conceded the fact that life begins at conception while i concede that life does begin at conception life is not equal to human life how is it not pro was once a fetus and has not got more or less alive . and lastly if the fetus is not human pro is a fetus outside the womb and so am i by pros reasoning so is it moral to kill a baby  minutes before it is born no what about a month before that no you study the stages and draw the line where it is human or not and if you were dying and on life support you would not be living independently would that mean your not human because your not living indepinley on no point has pro proven his claims only reasons to abort the baby for all of his modern medical research it is hard to argue with stats but he did not give any . pro asks con for evidence on why fetus equals human life well i assume pro was once a fetus and never stopped being human offspring and has just grown a bit . the fetus is human and in fact alive and not impossible to prove as pro states because I am alive and kicking and human from the start and did not change to being a human ,0
299, the supreme court agrees to hear the case filed by norma mccorvey known in court documents as jane roe against henry wade the district attorney of dallas county from  to  who enforced a texas law that prohibited abortion except to save a womans life . june   norma mccorvey jane roe files a motion with the you s district court in dallas to have the case overturned and asks the court to consider new evidence that abortion hurts women . january   the you s supreme court in a   decision affirms the legality of a womans to have an abortion ,0
300,well its unfair to the babies and the people having abortions can always have them because they are already legal ,0
301,what if a woman or girl you loved your mother or girlfriend got pregnant and you knew she would die when she had the baby .  science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks .  during the era of abortion bans women would shove hangars down themselves . this is why you see a lot more fathers abandoning children than mothers . abortion laws turn due dates into death dates .  the constitution uses the word not to restrict the government  times . certain women are not healthy enough to give birth . god obviously wants a mother to love her child so she has to suffer with it for nine months . and some of these women are not healthy enough to give birth . if they are lucky enough to survive the rape they are sure to die during child birth .  abortion laws are unconstitutional and unhealthy women to kill themselves for the sake of a child that nobody knows or loves unlike the woman ,1
302,there is no living human being inside of the mother at that time and the government has no right to be in control of reproductive health ,1
303,we can prove that a person has electric signals in the brain but as of yet we can not use this to prove anything about first person knowledge or thought . when you are in a situation where you are the only one who can protect a human life than it is your responsibility to do so . as for the argument about the abortion of dead eggs that is not immoral that is called cleanup . after it came out of the chrysalis it would be on its way leaving no permanent impact on you . there is no situation in which a fetus can be removed from a mother and still survive . if abortion is murder when you say that you never talked about endless rows of cells i want to bring up this quote . therefore the genetic test is the only test that can viably stand on its own because i can prove that i have human dna and i know that i have first person thoughts and knowledge and i can prove that others have human dna and i appreciate whole heartedly that i was not aborted . we would not want the murderer to have less chance of the crime blowing up in his face . old child vs   day old embryos you are attack on my counter to the analogy applies realism not inherent to the analogy .  mother v fetus let me set this up with one thing first . if you were watching one person stab another and you had a tazer in one hand and a gun in the other you would not shoot the guy being stabbed you would taze the guy with the knife . a sea horse is not a person but it fits all five criteria . bodily rights argument the right to life is the ultimate moral imperative for a government to maintain . the case that i bring up is a tragic accident where two people will die unless one of them is killed . you can use that victimization to better rehabilitate those in need of rehabilitation but you can not ever use victimization as a reason to not rehabilitate ,0
304,i was born with  mrntal illnesses so i empathize but i feel i have the moral right to live . my councelor says I am probirth control not prolife but i do suooport humans from genetic conception to death . god created you for a reason ,0
305,if you concede that a child gains the right to life at a certain point in the womb then the government has an obligation to regulate abortions even if it is only to make the determination that in a life threatening situation the most viable life must be saved . at this point this is your position a very small number of abortions occur after the   weeks so the government has the obligation to regulate abortions . at the point where i rob a bank my right to be involved in my decisions that affect my life and future ends . the amount of doctors willing to perform legal abortions is shrinking so much that there has been a  decrease in abortion training in hospitals over the last  years . a baby is the only form of innocence that humanity ever knows impeding upon the babys right to life for the sake of what is best for the woman is the ultimate act of selfishness . according to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women discrimination against women includes laws that have either the effect or the purpose of preventing a woman from exercising any of her human rights or fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men . it seems to me that the woman actually has more political fredom and responsibility .  this is actually the weakest point of your argument . if you take into consideration that a woman would have to a break the law . one part is all i needed to address you defeated your own position . i can decide that the best thing for my future is to have a lot of money ,0
306,i think every women has the right to chose what they want to do with their body ,1
308,abortion is defined as the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy usually during the first  weeks ,1
309,it is actually proved that   women who want to do abortion but see the baby through the ultra sound decide against their abortion plan ,0
310,if the mother is under  and raped we should not allow the baby to die for it . i am afraid that i do not understand how you can have no qualms about that if you are anti abortion but i also think that a baby and fetus have been confused here . i would not squabble too much and understand though if you simply disagreed and it was on the specific point of allowing abortion for those underage and raped even later in pregnancy ,1
311,i invite pro to let me know when they would like to retry this debate ,1
312,second even if you look to the argument it still is inferior because rights come from human worth . i do however point out that a reasonable interpretation of pros offer is that under those circumstances reason would be allowed to prevail . a fertilized egg can feels nothing therefore the level of violence is nothing this is wrong for two reasons first if someone was numb all over and then killed you can infer from my opponents logic that that is not a violent crime . third positive rights argumentation does not impact the resolution in so far as my structure determines the impaction . first since there is no universal definition of human being we must breakdown the word itself and then come to a logical conclusion . argument  this argument comes down to a standard evaluation . second my opponents logic leads to the fact that once a fetus develops a nerve system then it is a violent act to abort . to mitigate possible heinous crimes the fetus must be presumed as living just in case it is . apparently one can completely fail to respond to an argument  not know how to look up a definition and claim arbitrary nonsensical value criteria yet still claim victory ,0
314,another is that it rids the woman of any responsibility for her sexual actions and that she did not protect herself in other words there are condoms and other contraceptives which one should use if one does not want a child including abstention ,0
315,under this condition a fetus must be aborted ,1
316,well hello everyone i believe that abortion is right because what if a women gets raped god for bid or purely gets pregnant and does not want the baby ,1
317,once again after the  week mark the child can usually be removed from the mothers womb and continue living on assisted support . however the biggest problem with this ridiculous comparison is it in no way address early pregnancy terminations vs . terminating a pregnancy a week before a womans due date is not some absurd hypothetical . case and point pro begins by asking about the rights of the infant but then never addresses those rights . it is clear that pro does not understand they have the burden of proof for this debate . as i already addressed this in the previous round i will simply quote the late christopher hitchens anything that can be asserted without evidence . if pro believes the infant has some rights that are being trespassed upon then pro needs to address exactly what those rights are and how they are being trespassed upon ,1
318,this argument will be against whether or not women should be allowed to have an abortion ,1
319,I am looking forward to argue with you again with a better topic that is to both of our interest . the topic that i made was my first i just wanted to know how this whole debate thing work . this time it is your win ,0
320,abortion should be discouraged but it needs to be an option for women when they do not have any others . an embryo can not disagree with me because it is not a child at that stage . most doctors say they have at least one patient or know about someone who has tried to end their pregnancy by themselves ,1
321,now let us say that you are to young to have a child or not prepared but want a child in the long run well having an abortion done always carries the risk of not being able to become pregnant ever again in life ,0
322,an abortion can not be painful to a child as at the stage of development they can legally be aborted at they are a very simple organism that cannot feel pain or trauma it is incapable of knowledge around subjects such as this for instance can you find anyone that can tell you what their life was like before they were born then i would except the possibility of gathering knowledge but no one has ever made this feat . in the united kingdom which is where i live there is no abortion after  weeks which is still before any cognitive function . however a life is something that can function as a sentient being at this age a foetus is not sentient it is only working off of impulses that because reactions it is not in control of itself or its actions this is like when an animal is killed using an electric bolt the way they are killed now there are still electrical impulses that because actions because of the nerves that still cat after death ,1
323,i put a lot of effort into my argument wasted effort ,1
324,in any case the cost of these new methods is so high and likely to remain so that the proposition argument is irrelevant the use of ultrasound scanning leading to selective abortion is so much cheaper that this great evil will not be reduced ,1
325,it is not more than advice ,0
326,he has not made one single valid argument to challenge the law of hindered birth or to prove that it does not partially govern the impact that abortion has on society . however it is quite obvious that liberty is clinging to this with all the fervor of a religious zealot who will not change his mind on anything despite all the evidence to the contrary . did he even ready my arguments or is he simply arguing based on what he assumes i will say .  this does have to do with the law or the woman because if the unborn are living humans then killing them because they are unwanted is barbaric . i have proven that the unborn are living humans and have supplied ample evidence from embryologists the experts in the field who tell us that a new unique human life is created at conception . your resolution does not state that the law governs the morality but that it governs it . he has not responded to my arguments and he has certainly not proven any of his alleged or the resolution at large .  this does as you made the claim that no one or very few people think my ideas are valid . why would we treat the unborn the same way if the are living humans like you or more . you have not offered proof therefore you can not make the claim that my views are invalid simply because you disagree with them . in fact liberty has not supplied one expert who claims that life is instead he equivocates . you seem to be worried about the one that will make it through and survive and not the other fetuses who will be miscarried or flushed out . if a woman gets pregnant with her lover and does not want the child her situation is not likely to drastically change in nine months to where she would want a child . if you can not tell the unborn are human because they might not be born then you can not tell if a newborn is human because it might die of sids before it reaches adolescence .  this does have impact on the debate since you yourself have stated that life is and the potential wanted fetus is a human while the unwanted fetus is mere . they deal in what is true and observable .  it does as you have made the claim that by keeping the unwanted child the wanted one will . one way to tell a law and a theory apart is to ask if the description gives you a means to explain why . as i read my opponents final round argument i have to ask myself and i suppose the reader will also ask themselves if givemeliberty and i even read the same debate ,0
327,when symptoms start occurring she tells herself that it is not the abortion causing them . granted a baby cost a lot as well but the women or couple since there is another part here should have been more responsible . the women also might get an infection from dirty tools or from fetal parts mistakenly left inside . if the women is victim to pas or any number of physical damage they may need to be hospitalized . the last damage i gave was scarring of the uterus lining . this may because problems having birth in the future and may induce miscarriages . also in a  study  of women claimed to have some pain after an abortion ,0
328,i will yield this round in hopes that my opponent will have the opportunity to post a response before the end ,1
329,if i was stating the question in scientific form i main question would be when do you define a baby someone say it is as some as a sperm and egg meet others say a certain amount of weeks . in all types of situation it is wrong to kill a baby even if they were an accident would you kill your know child if he she is an accident . if you would not vote for me i think as soon as the sperm and egg meet it is a new live ,0
332,that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not . the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply . a reasonable person would say the tortfeasor must at least wait a few months until they can be separated ,0
333,and god does have a plan for every single baby but the likelihood of that baby becoming the person to cure aids or cancer is very unlikely simply because of the conditions that it grows up in . while it is true that the parents could take care of the baby is it right to push the burden stimulated from your own irresponsibility onto your own parents . also it is even more unlikely because since the mother had a pregnancy at an early age the future child might follow its mothers irresponsible actions as parents set the standards and are role models for their children ,1
334,thanks for the debate ,1
335,either way it would not be right to end the innocent childs life . but to instantly jump to the conclusion that the childs death is the first priority to everyone . abusive parenting i have argued this previously above in answer to your story obiously if most people would say yes and affirm then that is the the correct thing to do . she does not want to take responsibility of the child . is it easier to murder a potential life then to just wait out the nine long hard months . as if the child would be trying to commit suicide just to preserve his emotions . if that is the case then why not just kill everyone out on the streets who is living a healthy life . if they know they can not take care of the child but however do anyway that would be saved for an argument on parental responsibility not abortion . but there is the chance of it going possitively as well . they can give you results leading to the probabability of death even a high one at that . she still to the risk to have the child and it should now be her responsibility to carry out her action . she is now going to have to take responsibility of what she brought into life . on several occasions i am sure death was a big issue for him . but because they are is the liklihood of it going bad that means we should take it away from them . yes i am sure the question would arise to the child about there parents reasoning for leaving them behind . yes the child may die given certain circumstances but then there would not be any more level of grief for the child than already attained . i would argue more on the subject but i am just about out of remaining characters so for this round i would like to leave any viewers with this simple knowledge . yes it is miserable but applies in no way to the childs desicion . this applies to the same aspect of the child life or death being at risk when birth . but either way this boy found a loving and peaceful family to take care of him . if that is the case then us as people need to notice the flaw in ourselves . i hold to my argument about the sickness . denying the child that privilige no not privilige a better word for that would be freedom would be unjust and wrong ,0
336,may i point out that homework is bad so god is bad ,1
337,however if that was the case i would definitely raise the child as my own because taking responsibility is what separates the weak from the strong and i choose to take care of one of gods miracles rather than killing it . to counter your first contention I am sure that if you asked the whether or not it would rather live with that or lived at all it would have chosen the first option of living . as a side note you failed to counter any of my arguments that i made and because you have the burden of proof i have won the first round . while your second point makes little sense what i think that it says is about how the mother feels after . it took me another nine years to be a part of the silent no more program ,0
338,i believe I have made my case but with an absent opponent it is hard to say ,1
339,con will argue that the fetus is a person with said rights but that abortion is still morally acceptable ,0
340,it is also very dangerous and will make the mother feel bad in most cases . it is very clear to see that abortion only leads to more pain to yourself . well first of all i want to thank you making this debate ,1
341,the baby is much like a parasite even if it is born there are many complications in the postpartum of the pregnancy like many women die during childbirth more so than if they abort making many of your arguments moot .  my opponent does not address my argument but sidesteps it by saying what warrant do i have for saying that to be considered human there is more than one criteria to be filled besides having dna . and i pull attention to your definition because it is the parameters we agreed on it is not a semantical argument it is a practical one i did not offer a different definition nor did i try to change the meaning of the definition i simply pointed out that you were deviating from your parameters .  many women suffer mental distress after they have a child is does that make having a child wrong . to be considered human you have to have dna and be born because if you are not born you are not able to think or be sentient or feel a fetus can not do any of those things furthermore a baby is much like a parasite you use the word unnatural but a parasite takes nutrients by it is natural means ,1
342,let us do this good luck con ,1
343,so you agree with my statement in which abortion should stay legal and not be illegal . in that case my argument would be the only winning side . which supports my statement that abortion should not be illegal in other words unlawful illicit or illegitimate ,1
345,what i meant was that if a child is not going to make it long enough to even experiance any sort of life if they are just going to be so seriously disabled and so seriouisly handicapped that they are completely unaware that there is a life to be lived . so i reply if there is a minor chance that things will go wrong then i understand why people would opt for the chance to live but for me if a child was to be born and the chances were greater than  of him her not surviving the first week of it is life then its more or less going to happen can you tell me that doctors predictions are mostly wrong . at what point do you feel life begins only when you have asked yourself that can you decide whether abortion before this point is murder or not .  the whole victim of childhood sexul abuse was misunderstood p i mean that a grown up woman was not ready to have a child as she had been sexually abused and she is emotionally unstable due to her horrific past . it apllies to any situation he has to deal with not just the death of the mother this bit confused me because i was refering to the matyr as the mother who was giving up her life for the babies . and one last thing does this mean to say that if you have explored every single possibility and every single angle of the problem issue and you have decided for abortion that is acceptable because you have followed what you said . and the rape thing how could a woman be expected to go through  months of emotional turmoil constantly reminded of her terrifying and horrifying ordeal that she was victimised and unvoluntarly impregnated by a man whom she does not love . the child may grow up guilty ashamed and unwanted as their father was a rapist and their mother a victimised weakling . i know bad things happen and i know people live through them i know people get I will and recover but what are the chances of a day old baby pulling through brain damage or something . you also said if that is the case then why not just kill everyone out on the streets who is living a healthy life . but there is the chance of it going possitively as well ,1
346,hi philocat i accept this debate and also accept that the burden of proof is shared ,1
347, aside from the literal fact that you are not killing it in tree form the unique set of dna stuff is an interesting biological idea that you might think since it is unque it is a person but it is simply not necessarily the case . i think so because machines can make a person function when they are clearly dead this creeps out family of the dead if they see it they do it for saving organs etc sometimes and if you start using machines one by one on a person their heart and brainwaives the things that make them clinically alive or not can be usurped by machines and later they are vital signs would be working again . would you consider smashing to acorn to be the same as having killed an acorn tree . and if all the person is is machines and a beating heart are theyu alive . could there be a point when it is unclear like when machines start taking over a body . on one side you have human red blood cells on the other ameoba type organisms . true the cell in your arm is not going to grow into a person but the analogy can still exist as it is similar enough to make the point the initial cell is like a block and not the final product . it does not seem like a person would die in this regard even though it is a natural phenomenon and not the same as abortion . at a certain point it clearly is a human and it is unreasonable to think otheriwse . and in a way the machine argument goes beyond the idea that the early cells are in questionable form and shows that the mother cuold be like a machine on a lifeless body . of coruse the government could decide a point it thinks it is a person cleary but that is not necessarily the early organism cell . but i simply disagree and think it is a reasonable position to have .  i think it is reasonable to think reasonably disputed life can be valued less than the freedom to choose . true the early cell is unique no other dna like this an separate its own entity . if you have a snowball that you are going to use to get to that snowman before he exists the snowball obviously is not a snowman . if you have a cell like a block and start building the cell is not necessarily a human person either . to the counter contention that your red blood cell does not grow into a person .  most arguments are very lacking but i think this one is not so much no one knows so who should decide .  it is often the moral thing to do to defer to allowing others the freedom to do something heres it is unclar whether it is hurting another but the principle still is here and needs weighed ,1
348,this is important because i want to have my viewpoint challenged the reason i think rich or middle class women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish is self explanatory . this is not the case for rich or middle class women who almost always have the ability to get the procedure done by the end of the first trimester . the reason that poor women who get abortions past their first trimester are not selfish is because they may not have the resources to get one before the second or hopefully not the third trimester ,0
349,if you take the time to read my first paragraph and have an iq above  you would understand that i said that sex based abortion is sexist . kind regards someone with an iq above  . the topic is you are which means against meaning you disagree that i am pro meaning i agree that is is misogyny ,0
351,and i have another point if abortion is legal in rape etc . you are arguing the pro side which means that you support the initial claim i as con am pointing out that even if i agreed with your ideas on the morality of abortion i do not putting a non punitive law in effect is useless .  then i bet a lot of women would claim to be raped by someone in order to get an abortion . and i would prefer to have an abortion than to have a child raised in poor possibly abusive circumstances . it is an incorrect assumption to assume that everyone who wants an abortion will be able to afford a baby . many people do not have enough money or time to care for children . my point was that your main topic of the debate does not make sense because laws with no punishment will not be followed as strictly as laws that do have punishment ,1
352,i know this would be hard for some women to do but killing an innocent child is wrong ,0
354,definitions abortion judging from the oppositions first round it must then be defined that our abortion case is that of convenience abortion only not any incovenience abortion such as that of life threats rape and premartial pregnancy objections to arguments raise by oppositionsince we are talking about a cost analysis representation of then we shall clearly see that abortion is hamrful towards the let us make the assertion that a moral act cannot derive from an immoral act not that immoral acts can lead to moral acts in the future which is a possibility but that when something has origins in an immoral act then when the process goes on there is no possible way that any moral factor worth could be extracted from it or that the action could ever be morally justified . with this said the oppositions arguments for sexual freedoms inherently contradict the underlying logic of sex sex creates babies and that is the only moral and just type of sex that anyone could have . like us assent to say that all those who go to convenient abortions are weak minded and have no place in society for they let their emotions control them on the fateful night when it should always be reason that controls them . if a person has sexual intercourse not for the sake of having a child but for the sake of pleasure then bears a child without any ideas of from pregnancy then firstly that is an immoral act . if the child was created for the sake of a side affair and pleasure then that is already immoral as an act and nothing that can follow it can be considered moral except for the conventional way of treating such conditionals . here i am not arguing that since sex is beneficial everyone should have it but i am arguing that since in an abortion based concept sex has already been done then one should expect an off shoot and embrace it for humanity perhaps not mother nature will always benefit from another off shoot . arguments from moralitythe only actions with moral worth accordingly to kants theory of ethics are those derived from pure good will for if someone helps someone for the sake of helping and not from the sake of good will then that person has done no moral worth to himself or anyone around him . abortion potentially has the abilities to destroy the formula man woman room off shoot for our victory in the game of natural selection . firstly the first postulate to sexual intercourse is off shoot this is the only moral type of intercourse as their is a good will behind the action ,0
355,rights and freedoms are such that billionaires can not be forced to give up most of their wealth to save self aware suffering humans how much so then that a woman can not be forced to continue a pregnancy to save a non self ware non suffering human organism .  personhood rightscon makes the point that he could use other criteria but did not and yes i agree different criteria will draw the line differently between person vs non person which one has to do once some one starts talking about personhood neither side of the argument can get out of that dilemma . consent objection vs right to life the consent rape objection is problematic because the right to life argument is based on it being so fundamental that it can not be applied or rejected on the basis of whether said organism is the product of sexual consent or rape . prior consent does not mean consent can not be withdrawn laterpresumably con means in their kidney analogy you are hooked up to the other person in that case con seems to just assert that since you consented this means you lose any bodily rights choice to disconnect . the right to life as an absolute is untenablecon does seem to agree that one can not use the right to life in the absolute sense to justify forced continuation of pregnancy . if abortion is murder reducto argument contra con for this debate and the outside world the fact of legal abortion being available hangs tenuously as a never ending onslaught of pro lifers chip away at availability of abortion to women such as trap laws .  day human embryo is not morally equivalent to a human  year old childcon does not really engage with the argument here . rather it is the intentionality of moving what ever because you made the decision to do so beyond say a reflex action or mere response to stimuli . the logical point being previous consent to use ones body does not justify that consent can not be withdrawn later on . if you do reject such criteria yet recognize such aliens as persons then on what basis do you do so . secondly there is an argument that consent given of ones own body does not negate bodily rights choice later on . cons law consistency argumentlets see if we can help con out where in regard to the allowing abortion vs texting driver causing loss of pregnancy is manslaughter . since con has gone to the consent rape objection they can not also use a more fundamental right to life argument in order to justify forced continuation of pregnancy . if you are unhooked death is not probable it is certain for the violinist .  even if it is not as shown in the bodily autonomy argument the woman has the right to disconnect that does not apply in the texting driver hypothetical ,1
356,in engaging in this debate i will draw heavily upon my own biblical beliefs as well as scientific facts that i believe prove the sacred truth regarding the sanctity of every human life . when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg they combine to make one living cellular organism and the human life process has started at the moment of conception .   bringing together all of the evidence i have outlined in the previous sections a fetus is scientifically a human being . i shall endeavor to conduct this debate in the spirit of civility maintaining politeness while being candid despite the controversial nature of the subject . what moral basis do we have for terminating the life of an unborn child whose only was to exist as the result of someone else s evil deeds . however doctors and biologists can see enough through modern technology to tell us that a fertilized egg has an anatomy of cells . we have no moral basis before god or in scientific laws to take the life of a human being that has not even interacted with others yet . the strict biological definition of anatomical life is a structured form of living matter that is visible to the naked eye margulis  . i am assuming that the main scientific debate between pro and me will occur over the issue of cellular life versus anatomical life visible life forms . consequently the fertilized egg must be classified as an anatomical form of life which represents the start of the human life cycle . each of these can distinctly be seen by week four of a woman s pregnancy therefore the developing fetus is not a mass of tissue ,0
357,let us look at the effects of an imbalanced sex ratio  reduction in poverty ummm you are assuming that the men will be okay with having no children . the population growth may decrease but the increase in illegitimate children is going to be a major problem . in fact this is going to worsen the situation since there will be an increase in female trafficking rape cases will increase . the forum against sex determination and sex pre selection fasdsp was formed in bombay in october  its members were from varied backgrounds feminists health and human rights activists persons involved in the peoples science movement etc . we can take the example of south korea south korea is the only country that equalized its male female ratio and it was a country that legalized ssa and enforced it vigorously .  the introduction of the bill added an entirely different dimension to the campaign and forced the state government to give serious consideration to the issue . the assumption in the argument reverberates the common mentality of demonizing those who opt for ssa . saying that it was for the people to change their attitude to female children . the state governments having realized that there was no legal provision to back such action also remained inactive . one copy of the handbill reached the centre for womens development studies cvids in the summer of  . the district medical officer amritsar interpreted this statement at its face value and threatened the management of the new bhandaris clinic with legal action . at least given the law the practice is under wraps and there is a certain taboo in the practice .  the rebuttal to your claim that skewed sex ratio is going to increase women s position has been addressed at the appropriate place .   stabilization of population extending the previous argument maybe the traditional families would decrease but we cannot ignore the desperation of poor male members unable to find themselves a bride . for women the deficit situation may not improve their status at all despite what a rudimentary economic model would have us believe . scarcity of women would not enhance their position in society due to the simultaneous increase in pressure to marry higher risk of gender based violence rising demand for sex work and the development of trafficking networks .  greater crimes legalising ssa will almost certainly lead to a skewed sex ratio which would lead to greater prostitution rackets kidnapping sexual violence as is seen in china and india already ,0
358,none of this actions in and of themselves are ethically justified it is wrong to kill and it is wrong to steal but in light of the reason why they were stealing or why they were killing we accept it as a necessary evil . it is not a house yet and following the logic presented here we treat it as a bunch of  nailed together and standing upright . at the least its not possible to say you are ethically justified in ignoring the negative thing which occurred just as you cannot say that a woman is ethically justified in having sex and then aborting the child because she has no moral obligation to keep it . i think here it is important to stop and define exactly what it means to be ethically justified . we do not treat peach seeds like peach trees and accordingly we should not treat a fetus like a fully gown human being . you had the ability to make the conscious choice to not go to sleep for one night just as we have the ability to choose to not engage in sex without protection or birth control . however i will go as far to say as an abortion is not ethically justified if you have the foreknowledge that having sex with someone could lead to a child . to be ethically justified an action must be drawn from the principles of basic human ethics i e it is wrong to kill etc . in the same manner we do not necessarily treat a fetus like a fully grown human being but we treat it in a certain manner because we have knowledge of what it has potential to be . you do not go to sleep with the prior knowledge that you may potentially wake up attached to a violinist in dire need of your kidneys . an ethically justifiable action is one with the property such that by taking the basic set of principles that define basic human ethics such as murder is wrong theft is wrong etc . after that period it seems to me that as the fetus gains fully human facilities it should gain increasing moral significance . i think i have clearly established a framework to view this debate clearly defined what it means to be ethically justified and shown that abortion cannot be ethically justified ,0
360,i can see you will not let a little thing like grammar or punctuation marks get in the way of making zero sense and i can admire that to an extent . not sure how we jumped from your lack of understanding on chickens and their eggs but you also have a lack of understanding on the concept of life and death . whether or not it has a young chicken inside of it or not is entirely up to whether it was fertilized or not . so i hope we answered your egg dilemma and gave you some clarification on vs . the babies cells start to divide at conception this means it is growing adapting to its environment and responding to stimuli around it . when a sperm and an ovum come together and into fertilization . this is why small baby chickens are not found in your skillet on mornings that you make eggs for breakfast ,0
361,i hope my opponent is more persistent and successful in his other pursuits ,1
362,you may use the first round to make your argument ,1
363,the dna that makes a person who they are is first mixed at conception upon the male sperm entering the female egg . the time restrictions on termination had to be changed once when it was discovered that feeling developed earlier than first thought so they are hardly impeccable safe guards behind which to hide in the uk the restriction was moved from  weeks to  weeks in  due to scientific discoveries . killing the fetus thus destroys a growing person and can be considered murder ,0
364,the answer is far from simple but one must consider when searching for it that abortion if practiced at all should only be seen as a last resort . you could argue that she has the best interest of it in mind due to the natural bonds she develops but again those bonds are not a human nurse with an objective best interest to both the child and mother . he claims that abortion can save a child from having to deal with isues like pain brain injuries and poverty . death is an easy way to avoid any problem but it should not be left up to another as to whether a solution this permanent is justified . meaning that the abortion is not only affecting her and her body it is a decision to decide whether to kill something or not . my opponent and i will be sharing the bop in this debate since this is a dual sided topic where both cases can build arguments . however when you consider the same effect can be achieved by simply slaughtering the child upon birth then you can see the error in this logic ,0
365,now she is forced to drop out of school ruin all chances she has at getting a job and is a mess . i srongly disagree with the topic as it is a hard decision to make and many people require more than  weeks . but the thing is it took you  weeks to decide and you only found out she was pregnant on the  week ,1
366,there is often a considerable amount of personal hypocrisy in pro life libertarians and i consider pro lifers to be fascist at least to some extent but i am not going to say that you are not a libertarian as i do not really care about labels ,0
367,now i agree that some abortions are not handled correctly but that does not mean we should take that option away from women altogether . i believe a  year old should have the right to get an abortion but with an id . and i want to know why the fetus would be considered a living breathing full human being and no different from a baby or child or even adult . if you listen to these people and know their ideology you would know they are against them . it is not like the women wants to have an abortion either . i know it will end up being a child but if you take away someones brain they die so i do not know if a fetus is a human being when it does not have a brain . it is a tough choice she has to make and there is definitely no joy involved when it happens ,1
368, if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy would exist because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy there are many cases where abortions happen after viability . perhaps i could have made it more clear but in any case this debate is pretty much over . it is just not true that the child can not live without the mother ,0
369,since my opponent forfeited his last round i would ask that everyone vote for me ,1
370, again it now feeds on the nutrients in her blood more like a parasite or symbiote some studies have found that an incubating child can even donate white blood cells to the mother for fighting off viruses .  sadly two thirds of abortions reported in the united states occurs  weeks after conception granted the science claims that fetuses only begin to develop pain responses  weeks into gestation and only about  of women are able to get an abortion at this stage .  perhaps life does in the sense of a new journey but does that mean it was not alive before being born ,0
371,am i not right when i say something has to have a heart beat for it to be alive  . what would happen if you had been aborted    . you can get an abortion if it is not  mounths heart beat age  ,0
372,if the living dog already existed as a separate entity from myself and my opponent we would both have rights and therefore i would not have the right to kill the dog without pros permission . as I have pointed out a dog is already a living thing separate from both myself and my opponent i e the mother and the father . in order for his analogy to work he would have to prove that the people in question mother and father had sex solely for the purpose of pregnancy . pro says that if two consenting adults choose to have sex when the goal is not for reproduction that they are engaging in this activity for the reasons . since he cannot prove that people always have sex for the purpose of getting pregnant then he cannot say that we I am using this pronoun for the purpose of the analogy entered an agreement mutually to buy a pet . while pro might wish to dismiss my premise regarding what is required of the father by law he has failed to combat the very notion that abortion is about a womans choice and not mans property . this agreement is all fine and dandy unless my dog does not produce the puppies at all for whatever reason . second assuming that i would actually accept the analogy that the dog represents the fetus in this case the analogy still fails on the basis that a dog is a living entity outside of myself or my opponent . in other words people do not solely engage in sex just to have children so the reproductive correlation of sex is not the only aspect to be taken into consideration for this debate in terms of analysis or definitions . instead sex is more like a mutual agreement to have intercourse with each other usually with the aim of reaching climax and that is it . to conclude his say in this debate pro asks the question if this dog is both truly ours and just happens to be residing in your home at the moment what gives you the right to kill it without by permission ,1
373,the fundamental respect to sentient life must always be intact in order to preserve all of the other values our society holds today . i will not use the term of human life necessarily but instead talk about the value in which life is placed in society at the current time . rebuttal  again i have postulated that the greatest overall value that is held by our society as a whole today is the fundamental respect to sentient life . i am postulating that the fundamental respect to sentient life is the overall most imperative value our society has today . what good would economic values and personal liberties be if our society lost its fundamental value holding it together .  if our government wanted to protect life then it should ban the use of automobiles . as mentioned a good national policy should deal with what our collective society in the united states can deduce is more important and therefore values more . i am arguing that the fundamental value that is holding our society together is the essential respect to sentient life . but if i told everyone we should ban automobiles to preserve the lives of innocent pedestrians you would call me insane ,0
374, there are many more bible verses that prove that abortion is the shedding of innocent blood violation of the golden rule attempts to destroy the work of god encourages sin degrades human life disannuls the plan of god and shows lack of faith which i will gladly present in the next round if the circumstances are favorable . and then in  the you s supreme court finished roe v wade and initially made abortion legal throughout america .  and the baby that is eight weeks old or more than endures real physical pain .  my argument completely states that the law sees the baby as a human being and therefore avoid killing the mother until she completes giving nourishment to it p  p s   . it also has an impact to young people where they would know that there is no severe effect for that primary doing .  to think the fetus heart starts beating at  days and began to send brainwaves from his brain in  days these factors are used by the law to verify death brain and heartbeat . if men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart from her and yet no mischief follow he shall be surely punished according as the womans husband will lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine . by damaging the simplest human bond of all a mother and a child abortion breaks down the valued glue that unites america .  for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mother s womb . in the old testament god required death penalty to mothers who gave birth to a child prematurely and dies . and there is a possibility that the baby has a better life than anybody else refer to my statement in round  . psalm    elaborates it clearly that he was there personally and not as a blotch of tissue that later developed into his human figure . there is a possibility that your baby would be incomplete and a less chance of delivering a normal birth . it started with an intercourse and then the sperm penetrates with the ovum fertilizes and a new human life has begin no need for source .  how did abortion become legal in the you s ,0
375,i am looking for someone to debate that abortion should be illegal ,1
376,i thank philocat for accepting my challenge to this topic ,1
377,i accept this debate ,1
378,no it would not be considered murder if he she it had no rights . if you abort a baby in the late stages of pregnancy you are killing it . not only but since you are the instigator in this debate then it could said that you have an even heavier burden . it had a beating heart functioning brain skeletal respiratory digestive and other bodily systems . obviously in this scenario the fetus posses the right to life for which the criminal will be punished for having infringed upon that right . the burden is on you to prove that abortion is correct in every situation . if you kill a pregnant woman you are charged with two murders ,0
379,abortion is murder because scientifically these unborn babies are every bit alive they would be alive if they were prematurely born ,0
380,you are promoting the child as a consequence for the woman rather than a son or daughter that the woman would love unconditionally you want to force it upon the mother and that is unfair on the child because the mother will be unlikely to offer any sincere affection . you are answer to this is adoption which i have already rejected as a viable option although this would be great news to thousands of adoptive parents i can not see it being a straight forward procedure . i have already stated that the life of the child would be a horrible experience in the care of a mother that never wanted them but i refuse to accept your point as anything more than a bad attempt at a counter argument because you mentioned in round one that abortions are fine in the event of rape ,1
381,i never said it would be right to kill an orphan and that being an orphan is worse off than being dead ,1
382,tay sachs is a prebirth testable disease that is when the child is incapable of breaking down fats in his her brain causing death before the child is  and retardation earlier  ,1
383,as he has not posted actual arguments but rather summarized his overall position on the issue i will respond in kind abortion should not be banned on the basis that its ban would harm womens rights remove it as a method of medical intervention and lead to child abuse and neglect ,1
384,my argument is this  the moral position of one does not necessarily negate the moral position of another in a just society . pro states my argument is this  the government should not try to impose morality onto people but should instead let them  banning abortion imposes morality onto women . it does not ask should a just society bend to the morals of one group over another s . it may not be a complete rewrite but enough to allow slack to pro when rebutting my points .  a just society balances rightness in some part on utility and greatest happiness obtainable ,1
385,number  was a good point that is definitely brutal to me and as i said i would not want to have anyone i know ever do this because as i do believe it is a terrible thing to do it should still be someones choice to do that and because it is not ruled as homicide until the fetus is born then although this pains me to say the woman still does have the right to do that . i will take for an example that i saw on this website someone wrote that i am holding a baby and a fetus you need to choose one of them to drop the one that you choose will die if it is dropped the drop symbolizes killing one of them . i will also continue to do research also what do you think of trumps wall do you agree if you do then i could create another debate if not i will think of something else ,1
386,i also know keeping the baby from the attacker is a crazy idea but i think the baby deserves the right to live like i said you could either have the baby and give it up for adoption or let someone else carry the baby and raise it up as their own . i know what rape is like I have been raped it is hard to get over but if i had a child from the attacker i would keep it . if i had an baby from my attacker and had an abortion i would not be able to live with myself after that ,0
387,when you talk about the possibility of an adoptive parent and that chance being taken away i turn you towards the fact that there are many more possible children to adopt than there are people adopting for if the numbers were the same if not more parents than kids then there would be no more children who are looking for adoptive parents ,1
388,the problem here is the fact that you are missing the point of my previous argument although you might ask for help in raising that child the mother and child may have already died in childbirth due to the fact that the mother was so young also because she is young there is an increased chance of birth defects the child may have to bear for the rest of their lives why should a child have to bear that kind of suffering for something that is not their fault and may not even be the mothers fault .  the circumstances i listed above are things that this child might encounter and have problems with so why should a child have to live with themselves in the state they are in simply because their mother did not have a chance to end their pain and suffering before it even began . and sometimes their are women who do not have adoption agencies in their area or their families do not care about their situations so once again i submit to you that the points you make are far to generalised and do not encompass the entire spectrum of this issue and the many different circumstances that come with it ,1
390,so take a side with me and say no to abortion ,0
391,there are plenty of reasons i disagree with your stance but since this is your debate topic and your rules you go first ,0
392,this debate is not about demon possessed unborn babies ,0
393,opening statements in round two i am going to argue that abortion should be permitted in cases where the mothers life is at risk where the baby will undoubtedly have major physical and or mental handicaps and before the fetus develops consciousness and the capacity to feel pain . in all honesty i was reluctant to accept this debate as i seem to only debate big issues which can get a tad boring after a certain amount however i have not debated in rougly two months so i figure it is about time i get back into the game yes . another key argument i will make is that the fetus cannot make rational choices so it is up to the mother who can make rational choices to decide the babys fate before consciousness and brain activity sets into the fetus ,1
394,things happen for a reason and babys can have good lives coming from good or bad situations but it is there life and if we stop them from living it then what are we . if they catch it in the first month then so be it but beyond that to me it should not be there choice to abort a human being with a heart beat and brain waves . people can choose to do as they please we will all have to talk to the big guy one day but for me it is pro life because it is not our choice once a baby has any sign of life . that being said those are my only pros . thank you for accepting my request snd thank you to your parents for choosing to keep you so that we can have this debate ,0
397,quality of life after birth although abortion itself is not very pleasant we have to take into account the state of the parents are they financially stable . when the baby has been developing for  weeks it is no longer applicable for abortion now although this is quite away into the development of the child it is highly unlikely that abortions will be carried out as they become unsafe and usually if someone has left the baby this long they intend to keep it . if the parent are not able to give the child a good life then the child should not have to face the hardships of a life where its parents might not even want them ,1
398,i do not think god approves of abortion and i disagree with the pastor ,0
399,reasons to provide  ,0
400,could not it be said that the wrong doer should be forced to give that person blood and maybe even a kidney at least as long as the wrong doer would not die . and the last reason it should be illegal in principal is because the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy . also while this does not apply at first as the pregnancy continues the mother assumes the fact that the pregnancy continues to exist and she is not aborting when it is morally grayer . but on the other hand the earliest cell does meet the requirements for what would constitute an organism albeit it could probably be viewed as more like a parasitic organism given it must live off of the mother . the common arguments in favor of abortion should be used here as holistic approach to why she should be able to decide given the various moral considerations involved . i would take that same reasoning though and argue that it is such a strong consideration that it should at least be illegal albeit with no legal consequences . why should mothers liberty continue to be hindered due to someone who came as a burglar to begin with . the pro and con about human life here are enough to say in principle we should defer to human life but not clear enough to make any meaningful punishments for it . it is unclear there as it could be said to be with personhood . the person who caused the crash should not be able to evict the victim by tossing them to sea or killing them . you could replace planes and islands with cars and the wrong doers home . they are sustained by your kidneys and need them for awihle to live . hardly no one would say the person who caused the accident should be able to kill the victim ,0
401,i am advocating a right to life specifically for unborn embryonic humans and i have no requirement to extend that out to drone strikes war dropping the a bomb . pro assumes that i would save the  year old because i would instinctively identify the  year old as a person and the embryos as non persons . the problem is i never used a fundamental right to life argument so I am not sure why pro is attacking this . i have already demonstrated why these  criteria do not survive scrutiny which forces us to embrace a definition more in line with the uvaa a homo sapien at any stage of development which provides valid justification for making abortion illegal . if this is an acceptable rebuttal then allow me to use it on pros entire position the abortion laws could be wrong . of course anyone has the right to withhold consent before or even during sex but that is not at all what we are talking about . so saving the  year old does not prove the embryos lack personhood there could be many reasons for making that choice . this is a more formal presentation of the argument that an embryo is just with no consciousness or self awareness suggesting it is not human . again i never presented an absolute right to life argument so hopefully this is the last we hear of it . my point with this rebuttal is to show that pros personhood criteria are insufficient and would qualify other groups of people for death in addition to embryos which is not reasonable . if pro chose to save their child is it because their spouse was a non person . the right to life as an absolute is untenable pro phrased this argument in round  as a rebuttal .  year old if anyone has failed to engage this argument it is pro . as such my entire argument is in a sense a response to this . pro has not disputed my claim that a genetically unique homo sapien is created upon conception other than saying a human person must exhibit  additional criteria . pro misses the larger point here the uvva legally defines an unborn child at any stage of development as a full human with rights equal to those of the mother . nor have i advocated for an ex post facto law that criminalizes all past and present abortion ,0
402,abortion is the exercise of the property rights you mentioned but exercising those rights violates the superior right to life of another . if we are to assume that we all have equal rights acting to violate the right to life of another in the process of exercising property rights would forfeit your own right to life . therefore a mother exercising her property rights is a rights violation in and of itself ,0
403,i believe my opponent has forfeited this debate ,1
404,therefore if states do not allow for teenagers to be seen at an appointment without a parent or guardian present it is illogical for someone to allow the decision of an appointment for an abortion for a child to be there by themselves or make the decision by themselves . i believe that teenagers are not able to process what comes emotionally and or socially after they make the decision of having unprotected sex due to various cases of pregnant teenage girls that go to the school counselor just to speak of bullying or other critics that they may receive once made that decision . many parents would agree that a majority of teenagers are incapable to make decisions that affect another individuals life ,0
405,thus our implementation of human rights prevents these cases allowed increased stability at the cost of not maximising happiness which contradicts pro s value assertion . people must otherwise have sex as often as humanly possible and birth as many children as  . this strongly implies utility per person i e how happy each person is in society however he affirms his arguments for abortion in a sense that he is maximising total or net utility . counter rebuttalsliberty of foetusall of pro s defences to my arguments assumes that the foetus is equivalent to an adult human in its rights and liberties to which i have already provided reason why this is not the case . these are two completely different measures and hence he cannot hold on to his argument that we lose a total of  years of happiness if we abort with his current arguments for his value of utilitarianism as it is a fallacy as it stands . memoryi do not intend to demonstrate the connection of the permissibility of killing i intended to demonstrate that the lack of memories means that the foetus is for the purposes of liberty dead as a person . as a result political devices such as human rights of which i affirmed liberty is one of the most fundamental are required which does not entail maximising happiness on a case by case basis . moreover pro does not object to any of my facts regarding what foetus is a cluster of cells with no ability to feel pain or experience anything especially in the first few weeks . furthermore my argument is not about being aware of one s value of identity only that we do as a society value our identity hence why we prohibit actions that affect it such as murder thus we cannot value the foetus in the same way since it clearly does not have an identity in that regards . it is only by subjective assessment that one party is deemed to be happier than another thus it is useless as a device for separating out the preference of one act over another especially if it strips away the context . if a person was both comatose and amnesic a far superior analogy then pro would have to provide very good reason why the government should not kill that person . for example in the transplant surgeon objection we have a healthy person in a hospital who happens to be a match for five people needing different organs to survive . identitypro appeals to comatose people however ignores that identity is four dimensional and the continuity is provided by one s memory ,1
406,i as a human being do not in that my physical body changes you will not see me develop a skin tone better suited for absorbing solar nutrients so if pro is referring to physical adaptations then i as a human being am not alive either . finally pro said that the removal of the embryo or fetus to end a pregnancy . the only reason anyone would contest an abortion is because it is fatal to the fetus so if the fetus can survive the abortion i will not argue that it should be illegal . pro hinted at the argument that life for an unwanted child would be worse than no life at all so i will briefly address this point . i do not deny that home abortions might be a current problem although i would ask pro how common they are but i propose a different solution do not get pregnant or go through with the pregnancy ,0
407,i am pro abortion because i do not look at the specific action i look at everything as a whole ,1
409,thank you and no worries ,1
410,it would imply that if we had a machine which could transfer then any time someone died everyone would have a responsibility to transfer some of their to ensure that person lived on . in an act of charity a local apartment owner allows a few homeless people to seek shelter inside his building because he has a few unused rooms . if i have a right to not have my cellphone stolen that is to say i am the legitimate owner of the cellphone then you and everyone else have a responsibility to not steal it from me . that would mean that everyone has a responsibility an obligation to make sure i stay alive . finally it seems the main objection my opponent has is that as a result of evicting the child from the mothers property her body the child dies ,1
411,i still however support abortion but concede the fact ,1
412,therefore a that carries no penalties for its violators would be just a demonstration of holier than thou attitude . in a free country people in the minority are required to follow the laws set by the majority or face the penalties . even assuming that this resolution would accurately reflect their views in pluralistic society those who disagree with the majority are still entitled to their own opinions ,1
413,poor mothers would have to see their child hungry and living a life in poor conditions simply because the mother wanted to keep the child .   other situations as many agree on rape is a case where abortion should be allowed especially since the child could grow up knowing that she was never intended and was the result of a crime . death from childbirth is more common than one would expect . also adoption also has its own problems with bad families and even poor facilities at the adoption home another place where the child would suffer . in those cases would it not be better to let the child go or rather have the child suffer living a life of confusion regret and feelings of unwantedness ,1
414,also it is a human being the moment when the fertilized egg is implanted in the womb . the coment i just read did give me some insight and they are right the fetus is not the mothers body but an organisim inside it . and all abortions are done after they are able to tell they are pregnet and if they are able to tell they are pregnet that means there is a heartbeat ,0
415,it is true that pro abortion activists feel the fetus is not ahuman and does not have rights . it is almost a given that the mothers consent should be given before any drug enters her body or any abortion occurs . however the fetus has the dna used to develop a human body and organs ,0
416,i would not want either to die but given the choice between taking the life of  or  i would chose only the  .  this is a claim or something similar i hear all to often in the abortion debate . if you ever wondered why some regard the pro life as anti woman it is because of things like this ,0
417,the only way to get their immoral behavior accepted would be to change the definition of commonly understood words . of course there would be no chance for any harm to the mother if the baby were allowed to be born and then be put up for adoption . iv although marx says nothing about a struggle between men and women the feminists adapted his revolutionary rhetoric to their own because . anyone can see that this is only a very cynical attempt by the abortionist to kill the baby collect his fee and not be charged with murder . you see it is widely believed in this country that individuals should be free to make their own choices . v feminists believe that for women to win their struggle they must have total control over child bearing and be able to kill their unborn babies on demand . they have been convinced by endless propaganda that the practice of unrestricted abortion is good and that it must be protected at all costs . this extreme view comes from the radical feminists who argue foolishly that women should be free to choose to kill their unborn babies . the supporters of the final solution in hitler s germany made similar arguments when they advocated exterminating the mentally I will and others . they were deprived of the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness written about by our founding fathers in the declaration of independence . karl marx whose writings led to the disaster of communism believed that society was dominated by a struggle between the bourgeoisie owners of production and the proletariat workers . the name pro choice gives the evil abortion movement an aura of american liberty and apple pie . iii the feminists have cast this principle aside by allowing women to kill their unborn babies . the pro abortion activists have foisted on us this same semantic game . they refer to the unborn child as a fetus . since the supreme court handed down the roe v wade decision in  some  million abortions have been committed in this nation . let us further say that the evilness of drinking milk was obvious to everyone including children ,0
418,babys form in wombs not egg shells like a chicken . whether it is fully formed or not does not make the baby less human . either way chicken or human a baby is forming ,0
419,but what about rape ,1
420,thus everything he said is meaningless because i attack the idea that a fetus in the first trimester is a human . first off i want voters to notice that my opponent is trying to argue that all abortion should be illegal because if not then he would have clarified so . therefore if i provide him with one case where abortion should be legal i win this debate ,1
421,i can say for all his cases let us allow an emergency abortion but that still does not meet the criterion for his b o p that is abortion ,0
422,i was not referring to the possibility which you pointed out is incredibly vague but the fact that it is there . I am not saying we need more people beingborn just that they should not be killed unless it will  . my problem is that people will constantly say abortion is not murder but what is it then ,0
423,as far as abortion goes i think we stand on the same platform as far as the execution of the act goes only the law remains in speculation . if we fail to execute murderers and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims . and i agree there is always much more than a check in a box to describe your beliefs . do not confuse in believing the death penalty for every crime with that of when it is necessary . the average inmate on death row has an  grade education  have been convicted of prior homicide and  prior felonies . finally if a murderer is kept in a medium security prison it would be easily achievable for them to kill another inmate . sometimes it is a harsh reality but killing is necessary . it is a terrible thing to say but is the driving force of civilization since the dawn of society . the average death row inmate is held in a medium security prison . we are talking about guilty criminals being convicted by a jury of their peers who find them too dangerous and unfit for life .  again every rogue who severely attacks social rights becomes by his wrong a rebel and a traitor to his homeland ,0
424,if pro disagrees they may say so in their next speech and this point will be abolished ,0
425,as for my mother she was a black slave for a magian as for my name he has named me jual beetle and he has not taught me even one letter from the quran . so you have made mistakes against him before he has made mistakes against you bible children obey your parents in the lord for this is right . however making the decision to marry join the army have or not have a child to vote on your governmental leaders these are lifes biggest decisions and a  yr old is just not wise nor educated enough to have the freedoms to make these decisions on their own . there is a moral foundation for the laws as they exist and that is to protect minors from themselves .  children have the right to be treated equally vis a vis their siblings in terms of financial gifts . then umar turned round to the man and said you came to me complaining disobedience on the part of your son whereas you have not given him his rights . honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with a promise that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth ephesians    ,0
426,what does the specific location inside of or outside of the womb matter . what signnificance is a few inches . there was merely a technical malfunction ,1
427,the anti abortion position is usually a religious belief and threatens the vital separation of church and state . the reason society seems to believe that aborting a is to abort a human being but this belief is almost indefinitely nothing but a religious misconception . those in which are non religious do not see the vital importance of saving something that is not human in terms of abortion . many women perform this action because they do not that motherhood should be a for sexual intercourse which leads to my next sub point b motherhood must never be a punishment for having sexual intercourse . the world health organization estimated in  that abortions because   maternal deaths each year in countries where abortion is not legal ,1
428,but not only you also if other people had abortions we might not even have the abortion or microsoft and other technologies . third i do not feel that abortion should be completely wiped out i just feel that it should have more restrictions . in the form of a disability for if it will kill the mother for these yes and for just regular old reasons such as you were not responsible no that is just using an excuse to get out of what you did wrong ,0
429,but it is rare that one has the mind to concede when he has lost ,0
430,if we define bodily autonomy as the liberty to control ones body then clearly we recognise that this is a right . for example bringing up a toddler can because stress anxiety and other health issues yet it does not follow that the mother is justified in killing her toddler in order to improve her health . clearly in the latter scenario someone has the liberty to withhold the use of their organs and hence the government ought to not enforce it even in cases where it would be life saving . from this graph you can observe that the safety of abortions was increasing due to better medical technology with legalisation having little effect . women are not forced to have an illegal abortion if they are those who are forcing them ought to be arrested and hence they accept the risks of abortion by choosing to have one . but the other health risks of pregnancy do not justify abortion either since we are not justified in killing others in order to improve our health . the fallacy within the bodily autonomy argument is that it wrongly presumes that pro lifers appeal to the foetuss right to be sustained by the mother whereas in reality we appeal to the foetuss right not to be killed . this is essentially j s mills harm principle the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community against his will is to prevent harm to others . furthermore con makes the false assumption that having an abortion in these cases would increase the welfare of the woman . therefore abortion is not justified in cases of rape because there is no reason to suppose that it actually helps the rape victim and it even suggests that it negatively affects them . for example this criterion would mean that comatose unconscious people have no liberty including the freedom not to be killed . however it is not demonstrated that one can only have liberty if they value it . for example i have the bodily autonomy to control my fists but not to the extent where i can punch someone since this causes harm . in a stable civilised society the mother has obligations to ensure the welfare of her offspring whereas she may not have these obligations to those who are not her offspring . since abortion is the direct killing of the foetus this infringes upon this latter right not the former because the former is not a genuine right . therefore one does not have to value their liberty in order to have liberty therefore a foetus can still qualify as a being that has human liberties .  both of cons attempts to remove a foetuss liberty are invalid and hence the foetus retains basic liberties namely the liberty not to be killed ,0
431,slavery and the holocaust were once legal and i think we can both agree that that does not justify them in any way shape or form . all humans deserve to be protected under the law if you are going to exclude an entire section of the human race because they are dependant on others or biologically immature or temporarily incapable of certain high level biological functions that is a legal form of discrimination and discrimination of the highest order . she has cancer and is pregnant and needs the chemo to save her life but a bi product of that is that the baby will be aborted . a reason for this is because the child in the womb is a human being and that is inarguable as regards scientific fact . however as i have said before there is a line that needs to be drawn when the mother just finds it inconvenient to have the child or dislikes the gender race or the fact that a child had a disability etc ,0
432,but i think we could raise this baby my mother and father offered to help us with any financial difficulties and my grandparents would be able to take care of him her while we are at school . my girlfriend and i wanted to make a life together some day to get married and to have kids but now she is carrying life inside of her as a result of rape . conscious or not there is still life growing inside of you and to abort the baby would still be considered murder ,0
433,the woman actually does have every right to abort a child that she did not consent to .  of all you can not say that you won the  round because that is the peoples decision not yours . you said that i failed to counter any of your arguments but its kind of the other way around you have not answered all of my questions yet i have answered all of yours . also the child would be upset that he or she is a raped baby child because they know that its wrong . i do not think she is been raped four times ,1
434,every human being obtains the rights granted to the human race under natural law as soon as the human life cycle starts . this debate forced me to think in ways that i never thought before because i have never discussed abortion without involving the moral code laid out in my religion . under this natural precedence a womans right to life . as i pointed out in   the first things that develop from a fertilized brain are the heart the brain and the spinal cord . his her conduct was a lot better than anyone else who i have had this discussion before with and i really appreciate that ,0
435,it takes away from the debate and if you have to go with semantics you should not be debating ,0
436,the government should not force women to carry the product of their attack to term unless they want too which a completely different story . i appluad the women who are strong enough to keep the child but i do not frown upon those who make their choice of abortion when the pain and suffering is too great . imagine every shred of your safety and security being torn to shreds behind a dumpster in the middle of the night ,1
437,vote for con to protect of the little human organism trying to make it into the world . at the third trimester virginia state says now we think abortions at this juncture should not be legal anymore for some reason .  consciousness  reasoning  self motivated activity  the capacity to communicate  the presence of self concepts and self awareness if we use pros criteria to terminate living human organisms there will be no restrictions in abortions there will be living human organisms outside the womb that can be terminated . i know the appearance is not pretty during the embryotic period but it still a whole human trying to make it to the next stage in maturity .  therefore i submit that pro does not have a clear point when a human organism should be protected . there is no clear point for pros side with only statements of . my argument is that protecting the potentiality of human life is at a clear point human life begins at fertilization . doctors have test urine or blood to indicate presence of hcg to confirm a woman is pregnant . I am not sure why pro uses in the claim if you do not really mean restricted ,0
438,i will argue why abortion is okay and why this justification should make it legal ,1
439,also if a person even a fetus or an embryo has a name than it they would probably be considered to important to be killed . abortion is the reason that there are not enough women in china . abortion also affects many different countries in the same way ,0
440,a fetus is not an egg ,0
442,i do not believe that an abortion can be justified in any circumstance because an abortion is a murder of an innocent and i do not believe that this can be justified in any way ,0
443,this is a real wide problem that you have not taken the time to argue at all except by saying that you do not or it is moral . respectfully your personal feelings just are not relevant to the truth that abortion is a sure way of population control . the problem is not that i do not believe in human rights . the problem is you failed in your definition of human rights based in nature . how many times have you seen a child share without the prompting of a parent or teacher . but as discussed in my earlier argument hitler sought out what was best for himself . you obviously do not deny that there is a population problem or else you would have stated it . i will return to the population control argument that i offered in round  . or a toddler in the grocery store throwing a huge fit because the child does not get what he wants . i would argue for both i give you credit for that addition that helps my argument . you obviously do not deny that this population problem is causing a depletion of our resources . more natural to humans is selfishness . to control population i would say abort and have safe sex ,1
445,i do not check the profiles of instigators when i accept debates something i should learn to do . second abortions will not stop if they are banned . all the effort i spent on my case was wasted thanks to this ,1
446,since I am not going to re state everything i did earlier i will only focus on the point i have not addressed yet . as i said earlier that the unborn are healthy and in no way need to die unless you deliberately rip them apart limb by limb and kill them . someone dying who needs your organ is not killed by you if you say no they just die because of natural causes . third the womans uterus and body is made to support the life of the unborn . on the other hand sex has a natural order that puts someones life in your hands ,0
447,pro never address when it is too late to have an abortion why women should not be allowed to have abortions later in their pregnancies and under what circumstances a woman should or should not have the right to a late abortion . second an abortion after  weeks becomes a late termination and the child usually survives outside of the mothers womb on life support . your statement that this is a philosophical argument and therefore you do not have to provide facts only argue logic is not valid for this debate . this alone should be a good enough reason to keep later abortions . restricting womans abortion rights is what is called an a posteriori issue it exists in the real world and needs to be addressed by empirical information ,1
448,abortion is completely fine when you have the abortion the baby practically is not even alive so who cares also its the mums choice is it not and it is extremely scary and painful to have a bay personally if i got pregnant i would have the baby ,1
449,if my opponent had her way children would be forced to carry a child and put themselves and the baby at risk . my opponent was disrespectful throughout this debate not just to me but to commentators as well . i have debated my point and i thank you for your time ,1
450,i assume he is arguing about later in the pregnancy since that was my focus . the only distinctions i see that you could draw are the hindrance of the mother . if it is okay to kill right in the womb can not we just say we do not want this baby to have adoption issues so we will terminate the newborn ,0
451,the sharia law example was just to show that there could be an immoral state some may argue syria or iraq in  and that therefore laws should come from a more objective maybe utilitarian standpoint rather than merely a social contract . i advocate utilitarianism and i hold that if we all have these rights we feel a lot happier and safer and that is essential to happiness . there is a sanctity of life and that s why i would not want the mother risking her life to have a baby and abortion should be legal in these cases the vast majority of abortions are not for this reason . your whole argument seems to rely on the view that only those in the social contract are protected so there is only an ethical system protecting a few people . however it would not be an act they were responsible for and i think that ultimately people born in such circumstances would appreciate life even at the cost of knowing the truth ,0
452,a women should be able to commit a crime because she was irresponsible and wants to kill an innocent human . you said that the world is overpopulated but then stated that death is a natural thing therefore if people are dying everyday then we would need to continue populating the world . i disagree because if a women cannot a child then she should not participate in such activities that can result in becoming pregnant ,0
453,healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother or trivial reasons when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed .  to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do . in cases where mother wants abortion or to be free from the baby but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted ,0
454,there is a a child inside your body and you should give birth then get rid of it ,0
455,thank you for your rebuttals coding source and i applaud you for taking this debate in a direction that i have not seen before which made it incredibly hard to write a conventional argument and i had to completely scrap my pre made rebuttals and my constructive speech . this i would state is a completely different argument then abortion because it would not be saving the womens life or have any of the merits of abortion . the same study found that women unable to obtain abortions were more likely to stay in a relationship with an abusive partner than women who had an abortion and were more than twice as likely to become victims of domestic violence . a university of california at san francisco study found that women who were turned away from abortion clinics because they had passed the gestational limit imposed by the clinic were three times more likely to be below the poverty level two years later than women who were able to obtain abortions . according to a study co written by freakonomics co author steven d levitt phd and published in the peer reviewed quarterly journal of economics .   john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that .  it is for the reasons that i have stated above and in my previous speech that i would encourage a vote against the resolution . if the unborn child were not seen as a person in the eyes of the law there would be no need for this prohibition . in addition to the whole thing many women particularly teens are shunned and shamed for their pregnancies not only by friends families employers and classmates but also by advertisements in the subway . before i move on to my constructive speech i would first like to rebut a number of point that you made in your beginning argument .  susan a cohen s risk of mental health problems turnaway study ansirh org accessed april. because and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion .  the mortality rate of a colonoscopy is more than  times greater than that of an abortion . i look forward to my opponents rebuttals and speech in the next round . in short there are a lot of reasons a woman might seek an abortion ,1
457,i understand that we gave the child a chance to live but there are bad mothers out there that can make a child feel like crap especially when a certain mother wanted to get rid of a certain child in the first place . if a government is permitted to force a woman to bear a child where will the government stop . abortion is a very personal decision made by a women that she feels is correct a majority of the time ,1
458,preventing a life from forming is not the same as murder just like deciding to wear a condom is not murder ,1
459,thus i think under my opponents moral framework it would also be rather permissible to end the life of a fetus considering that it exists in a vegetated state . for starters my opponent says that his argument does not hinge on potential life but i honestly do not think that that is necessarily the case . for instance my opponent says that the act of destroying a fetus is immoral but apparently wearing a condom is completely fine . on top of that i do not think it counts as life anymore than a sperm does especially considering that a fetus has no free will and cannot sustain itself . finally on this subject I would like to point out that even a fetus of  months does not have a guarantee of being born ,1
460,I would like to recognize that our own exchange was more similar to my example than yours . you make person b call it in a way that violates the law of exclamation while simultaneously making sure that person a is innocent under quirks exception . godwins law refers to all internet conversations and it is awesome if you are on the right side of it ,1
461,women should be able to have abortions ,1
462,well yes it is because your ending it is life but you are responsible for that life and if you can not support that child or you are to immature then most likely you do not want that responsibility because its a big one . life and death a large part of our debate has been on how mean life or death is so i want to go into it a bit more . adoption now although that was a lovely example of the benefits of adoption like anything that is not always the case adoption can be hard how would you like to find out that these are not your real parents and that your own abandoned you ,1
463,and you dropped my point in regards to the  amendment just because it grants protections to a group of people does not mean that all other groups are excluded and as i stated before the  amendment insures this right to all persons . either way a chinese person is still a person . a person is a human being some thing with a complete human genome as well as a functioning system of organs ,0
464, of abortions late term . the bigger problem is the difficulty of objectively inquiring into the reasons women decide on abortion .  of abortions were late term    ,1
465,the fact of the matter is i think its wrong to force any woman that you will never meet to do or not do anything ,1
466,i do not deny that an abortion is the snuffing of a human life however i think it should be legal under circumstances where we can prevent suffering and be merciful to those who would otherwise experience a lifetime of pain . it is an act of mercy to allow young women a second chance without being shackled to take care of their mistake for the rest of their lives . so in order of your arguments i will respond thusly the destruction of human life is indeed wrong . it is an act of mercy for children who are in the womb of an alcoholic and will be born with deformities and deficiencies that could quite possibly damn them . the argument could be made for the fact that their fate is not set in stone however i would argue further that the margin of exceptions is very thin ,1
467,i would say in that case you would be setting the baby free into the kingdom of heaven not arguing this but this is just food for thought in looking at it from a pro choice religious aspect and this is irrelevant beside the part that most pro life people are believers of god but since the debate has not gone to this topic and would be too late now I am going to rebuttal your points from your post and address the questions that you asked . even then if we are going to do a study on this from all abortion cases the rape ones might be the ones in first place compared to the others so it is worth looking centering around for this debate . as a law abiding citizen of the us and the state you reside you have the legal rights to have an abortion even if those are against it and it would seem to me that most would be understanding of rape cases . again i agree it is stupid for mothers who get unexpectedly pregnant and discard the baby like trash after but it is a choice it is the law and the mother has that right . now it would be better to string up a poll on but heres the thing although that would be a better agreeable ground for most and resolve the issues the thing is you can almost never know if someone is telling the truth about rape or lying therefore abortions sadly have to be open to all those who want to have one . i feel that i addressed the other cases of abortion that does not deal with rape victims well it is something they can control for the most part sure a rubber can break but the chances of getting pregnant from safe sex are very low compared to unsafe sex . yes it is often said that one does bury their own grave and this is true just for about most choices in life but one that should stand at from this is whole ordeal is that there is no clear win situation for the mother ,1
468,i now ask you how any one person could take away that chance from someone so innocent and incapable of deciding for themselves this to me is disgusting . going into the discussion of womens rights as a female i do understand what women had to go through to obtain and hold these rights that we have today however many women act impulsively when deciding on abortion and this is not a subject that should be taken lightly . if a woman did not want to get pregnant she should have taken the right precautions to secure that she would not end up pregnant . in an il hospital in  it was discovered that the hospital was shelving babies in a dirty utility room to wait for death because the abortion did not work and the baby was born alive . this means that a baby can feel the pain it is forced through when it is aborted . this is sick shoving an innocent little baby into a dirty small room so the baby can die alone without even trying to save it is inhumane and indecent . do not get me wrong I am not saying that we should women for bad decisions using their child but at least give the child a chance by putting it up for adoption or finding a couple who would be willing to adopt the baby ,0
470,everybody is put on this earth to bring good how will that happen if someone is killed before it is even born . yeah i do admit that i would not want to keep a child if i ever got raped . why would you want to kill a baby when there are spouses who are unable to have kids and want to adopt ,0
471,before that it is a fetus with no rights civil or otherwise . according to common law and tradition in the western world life begins when a baby takes it is first breath . does a human life begin at birth ,1
472,my opponents final argument is completely irrelevant ,1
473,healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed .  to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do . in cases where mothers life is at risk but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted ,0
474,what sort of morality is this which declares the purpose of man is to be a slave not to something greater but to whoever comes along who is less then themself . he may be forced out of the home if he refuses the home is not his entering it on any but the owners terms is trespassing but he cannot be rightfully forced to go a specific place for any reason but to put a stop to such trespass . what corruption of standards allows you to declare as another beings claim upon my actions not their good qualities what they will trade for it but the fact that they are an incompetent . second if they are wise enough you are wrong and if they are not you are still wrong because you are impeding justice you are attempting to shield them from the consequences of their actions .   fight disbelievers who are near you and let them see the harshness in you .  because children do not respect their parents advice they grow up missing the significance of much they encounter and so wisdom comes to them very slowly . now is it possible you could maybe make some arguments based on this world rather than the imaginary world the authors of the bible and the qu ran wrote about . the I will conceived decision to rob a human being of several years of their life can never be undone . and a disgusting ad authoritatem the qu ran kill disbelievers wherever you find them .   if the unbelievers do not offer you peace kill them wherever you find them . but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves ,1
475,how can you deprive another life of something that you enjoy and still consider yourself to be a good person . my second argument is that if the mother truly does not want the baby she does not have to kill it but should rather put it up for adoption . while the argument of abortion is a serious issue in this country many people overlook the fact that the choice that the woman makes does not affect her life but also the life of another . and although our adoption system in america is currently failing if i were put in the situation of that baby i would much rather live in a foster care system then not live at all . no matter what the baby looks like if she just then she should seek mental help and just put the baby up for adoption rather than killing it ,0
476,it is true that if someone kills a woman intending to have a child then it is counted as a double homicide or in your description vehicular manslaughter . there are some religions that claim a soul enters the embryo at conception a claim of which is unprovable and untestable . i give the floor back to pro who will now bring new arguments to defend his point and may counter my arguments as well . that means even if my heart lungs and liver could each save one person no one could touch my body . killing the unborn child of a woman who had every intention of giving birth is considered murder because of the autonomous rights of the mother . if we are going to use the law to influence our decisions i suppose i d claim that this supreme court case will trump any other law that might be used to counter my arguments . up until a few decades ago women didn t have the right to vote or serve in the military ,1
477,if we consider these cells to be human beings then sperm cells must also be considered to be human beings and so whenever a man goes four days without having sex he has committed murder . human life begins after twenty four weeks of conception so before that time the fetus does not have a right to a life because we cannot give human rights to non human entities . statistics show that only  to  of women are actually depressed and guilt ridden after an abortion . I have just been raped I have been deprived of my right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness and I have been emotionally scarred to re experience that moment over and over again in my head for the rest of my life . on top of that the family usually does not support the mother after she gets her abortion and the loneliness does not help her cope ,1
478,moreover even if a fetus is not a person yet I am saying yet since the fetus will become and has the full potential to become a person does that mean that it does not have the right and chance to become a fully grown human person and have a life and future like us .  since fetuses have the same kind of future that we do and will become fully grown humans like us and since it is wrong to kill innocent humans and to deprive them of their futures it follows that it is wrong to kill fetuses and thereby rob them of what is of the greatest value to them their own life and future . i will however argue that even if a fetus is not a human yet it has the full potential to become one . therefore i will only refute the  most common objections to this argument . however the right to self ownership cannot justify killing a fetus which will become a human being and have a future and life like us . the fetus will become a human so by killing it you are not even allowing it the right to become a human and have a life . thus if you do not allow women to take abortion you are denying womens rights on their freedom of choice . don marquis probably the founder of this argument says the effect of the loss of my biological life is the loss to me of all those activities projects experiences and enjoyments which would otherwise have constituted my future personal life . moreover even if the fetus does not feel pain when it is being killed that does not justify killing it and depriving it is right to a life and a future . thus even if a fetus is not a person or a human yet it should still not be killed and deprived of it is chance and right to become a person and a human being . after that i will refute some of the objections to this argument . in fact if you had killed me when i was a fetus i would not even have the chance to be here right now and talk to you . you are basically taken ones right to even have a chance to live have a life and a future . if someone kills a human being he or she will get in prison their whole life or at least in a very long time . that however does not mean anything more than that it puts the womans personal interests and comfort above the value of a unborn babys life ,0
479,no it should not be legal ,0
480,this portion alone warrents a victory but i shall continue for the sake of the debate . my opponent brings up these sources urls but they do not really take you to the exact source of where these things are said . john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that . in this debate my opponent has yet to prove that the fetus is alive or that it is murder to begin with . with that we can see that abortion is an issue of privacy for the women my opponent has dropped this argument ,1
481,ok what if the child was around wat if she gave him away to a foster home or if she actually did keep him he might keep reminding her about the whole session by looking like the rapist in ways also what if the rapist experienced many disabilities like psychotic abnormalities also for the child he might become very angry with the world for what he has heard and decided to end it all or start his own raping rampage yet for a girl offspring what if she wants to get back at societe by shooting up a mall or taking drugs to forget about this horrible thing on what she heard also do not forget not every child is normal the one thing that happens is the mother usually gets an abortion or sends him away ,1
483,thereby it is essentially as dictated by a free tolerant society legal to have abortions by those medical practitioners who agree to perform them ,1
484,scotus decided in roe v wade that a right to privacy under the due process clause of the  amendment extended to a womans decision to have an abortion but that this right must be balanced against the states two legitimate interests in regulating abortions protecting womens health and protecting the potentiality of human life . there is no other circumstance in which any persons body is forcibly used to keep another human being alive against their will . for example if someone needs me to donate organs blood or plasma i cannot be legally forced to use my body to save their life even if it is my fault they need help say my drunk driving caused a car accident and their lives are now in danger because of my choices . pro writes that females waive their right to bodily autonomy by consenting to sex . it is the ability to feel think perceive and be self aware amongst other things that makes this important moral and legal distinction . however the push to criminalize abortion and not those who need fertility treatment proves the contention is less about protecting human lives and more about controlling womens bodies . however compare this to euthanasia which is the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering . however pros standard of the right to life means women who are in specific danger due to restricted medical care or resources especially in africa and south east asia will be forced to birth children even if it means that they are likely to die and that there babies will die or be uncared for . while adoption may be a viable option for some particularly in the you s in other parts of the world that is not necessarily the case . abortion should be a legal choice for women because it is risky and directly involves their body and health . fetuses arguably do not have the right to life specifically as it pertains to mandating the use of the mothers body to survive . we do not give  year olds the legal right to drink just because they have the potential to turn  . this can be useful at treating disease and saving other human lives the lives of those already sentient . even if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant . indeed most people who are do not support legal measures to protect life when it comes to caring for the sick and impoverished who need care in order to survive . the constitution has been amended  times since its inception and interpreted innumerable times by the supreme court meaning the law as written is not necessarily the way the law has ought to remain . embryonic stem cells are of great interest to medicine and science because of their ability to develop into virtually any other cell made by the human body ,1
485,this is passing into the realm of morality slightly with the question con has asked me and as a person who subscribes to secular humanism for morality i will try my best to answer cons question . it is only going to add suffering due to the financial burden on their part as well as on the child for it may be neglected due to its parents having to work day and night to support it . so aborting the baby is the equivalent of that as it relieves the mother and child of future stress and suffering and in both cases the baby would not be born anyway . having the baby born would be punishing both the mother and the child as the mother has to spend time and money to raise the child while the child may not have a good childhood due to the mothers inability to take care of it sufficiently or as a single parent . the main answer i would provide is that it causes pain and suffering to the babys family ,1
486,likewise no one should say the baby should be at the mercy of the mother at least later in pregnancy . you merely state that two seconds outside of the womb is insufficient to kill the child because it no longer is attached to the mother . no one would say the victim in the analogy should be at the mercy of the person who caused the accident . if a mother or parents cannot handle a child why force them to have it simply to satisfy the people who do not believe in abortion . i do not understand why you took this debate if you do not think the mother should be able to abort a week before her due date for fleeting reasons ,0
487,to support that statement i just mentioned rising birthrate is slowly crawling its way up and to prevent that parents should be wise whether to have another child or not . very well it depends on what danger the child or mother is in . second  people die everyday it is normal for a baby to take their place in this world ,0
488,same thing goes if the father wants an abortion but the mother does not . you want to keep the child but your girlfriend wants an abortion . the father has no rights until the second his child is born . in many countries if a woman wants an abortion there will be an abortion even if the father wants to keep the child . a fetus having rights is a door for men having rights over abortions ,0
489,I am strongly for making abortion illegal but i will play devils advocate ,1
490,those people are just dumb and are a slave to their desires and have no self control . if you are talking about those people who have a baby at  then the should absuolutely have to carry the pregnancy to term . my mother has been in a coma once and believe me that is not okay to just kill people in comas ,0
491,the bat lewis carroll twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what you are at ,0
492,thanks for reading this far ,1
493,as much as i despise hitler for many reasons hitler only became involved in what would be the nazi party in  .  is that it would bring peace to the world the  is that it would only be used on children of extreme naughtiness . I will stop here and elaborate further on later if i must but here are some points of why retrospective abortion should not be allowed it might not protect the world from future tyrannical people who act like normal children in their early years this process could put to death thousands of children whose lives would not have caused the misery of millions childhood behavior does not foretell how they will act in the future many of the people who are infamous in history did not develop into who they became until adulthood the age limit of such a law could allow people who do act evil to escape the system parents may try to exploit the system to have their children aborted because they could not get an abortion before ,0
494,using this conception of the law and justice i will argue that abortion should not be illegal in the sense that abortion does not infringe upon a fetus rights if they indeed have any in such a manner that it constitutes law to prevent it . i feel like there was not any formalized argumentation from my opponent to start this debate so i fee like this is a chance for me to present an opening statement of sorts that explains where my argumentation in this debate is going to go . in negating this resolution i will argue specifically that the legality of an action comes form the idea that ones rights end where anothers begin ,1
496,i accept good luck ,1
497,abortion promotes a culture in witch human life is disposable  . the original hippocratic oath traditionally taken by doctors when swearing to practice medicine ethically forbids abortions  . women should not use abortion as a form of contraception ,1
498,it would reflect that we see it as wrong but that we also recognize the difficulties involved so we do not wish to punish it . the cost to make that sort of law would be de minimus in the bigger picture . that could be argued to include money we could spend on something else ,0
500,okay this has to be at least one hundred characters so i am just going to ramble so she can have a chance to respond ,0
501,even if it were accepted that it is unjust to destroy a fertilized egg which i do not grant it is greater injustice to violate the rights of the woman to govern her own body . neither pro nor anyone else would allow a child to be killed at age three on the grounds of the child being the product of a rape . from the viewpoint of society this is a substantially greater injustice than terminating a fertilized egg . if human worth can be degraded then morality has lost meaning . for example there is a clear distinction between a person being struck by lightning compared to a person shot in the face . when pro grants the exception to allow abortion over concern for the health of the woman pro grants that the woman has a greater right to live than the unborn . pro illustrates by claiming that there is a right against that exists independent of human rights . since i have proven that a a fetus is a human he concedes to the dna argument b a fetus is a being proven by definition you can now extend this and use it as a drop to his case that the fetus is indeed a human being . a fertilized egg is both within the woman and cannot survive independently of the woman therefore it part of the woman . i e only social abortions second yes dna does make up a human third the clash comes down to the idea of . thus if rights are in conflict the rights of the woman supersede .  basically my opponents logic means that it would be justified to kill a child even after he she was born because he she could not be properly cared for . pro implicitly acknowledges that fertilized eggs are not human beings by providing the exception for rape in his assertion ,0
502,the point of that story is that yes she could of got an abortion from the begging because the condition was obvious in ultrasound but she stuck by her baby and let it pass away when it was ready to she wanted god to take it on his time not at a scheduled time so i feel it should not be a popular as it is because people get an abortion because oh I am not to mature for a baby well you were old enough to have sex trust me your not going to tell me about hard I am  and got pregnant at  ,0
503,the rest of the rebuttals were simply rebutting my points that did not really matter and in fact i will be the first to admit that they were not strong . the reason that i do not need to prove that abortion is immoral in some circumstances is because we are both trying to argue that at least there are times in which abortion is immoral or more specifically should not be allowed . however i do not agree with it as even if a zygote is considered human since it has cells that only belong to homo sapiens it is still as unconscious as a skin cell . rebuttals and pray tell in what way does a zygote have a rational nature without even having a brain . this does not have to do with it having rights or not or that its life is not worth living it is simply stating that it will not have a life and will instead either be aborted sooner or die in more pain later . the only time that it lives outside the womb will be in more pain than abortions in early stages because . therefore masturbating or having a period is infanticide as well as cutting yourself even though that is not good swabbing your mouth for dna spitting and a plethora of other things because you are detaching cells from your body to die ,1
504,they should not feel guilty considering the fetal brain does not begin to develop until   weeks into the pregnancy at which point it is little more than a hollow tube filled with dividing neurons ,1
505,if the fetus is sentient life it is required to be held to such regulations therefore permitting abortion despite it is sentience and right to life for it has no inherent right to the mothers body it would violate her bodily sovereignty . i agree with your claims that sentience is important to understanding bodily sovereignty but you are flawed in saying it is above such sovereignty . if the fetus were indeed sentient life it would have no such right to the mothers body . the problem with your proposition is that much like how being born into a country means you are to be subjected to it is laws being sentient requires you to follow certain rules . one of those being that it has no inherent right to the mothers body because of her bodily sovereignty ,0
506, now i myself am against the death penalty but i do understand the argument and i would love to get into that a different time . p s if you have never seen pictures of an aborted baby i would advise you to although it is graphic and gruesome you can clearly see developed hands and feet . putting a scientific term helps make the situation easier because your not ending a babies life you are terminating a fetus which has no value . in the same way most pro choice liberals are against the choice of being able to own a gun and all that entails . to say they are against is a bit ignorant because they are not specifically against all those things . I am sure you have heard about the gosnell case and the details are disgusting . i think that we celebrate birthdays on the day of birth because you can not always know for sure the date of conception well a doctor can approximately and also that the day of birth is just as much a celebration for the mother as it is the child ,0
507,and the uvva prevents abortion of fetuses as it defines them as a a child in utero and the term child in utero or child who is in utero means a member of the species homo sapiens at any stage of development who is carried in the womb . this is not a sanitized procedure it is not humane and it is not always performed on a fetus who can feel no pain many of the babies on whom this procedure is performed are capable of a viable birth . the  supreme court considered that they went above their borderline as the us constitution has no warranties in the concerns of privacy and abortion and that abortion is a subject for the legislators not the judges themselves . as a result many providers now stop the baby s heart with a lethal injection prior to dismembering the fetus in utero . and truly the mothers of celine dion cher justine bieber and tim tebow among others are told to undertake the procedure of abortion but just denied it and instead gave birth to them . due to upsurge of the possibility of miscarriage and placenta previa it can because mental stress to those who have done it too .  the guttmacher institute addressed that  of women having abortions every year had at least one under their belt and  . if the unborn child were not seen as a person in the eyes of the law there would be no need for this prohibition . v botsford explained the purpose of the common law doctrine to guard against the taking of the life of an unborn child for the crime of the mother . the decision says that women have any right to abort a child in early weeks of pregnancy but inhibits their ability to miscarry a child in later weeks . and if the   reported abortions in  are taken individually then it means that   women died from doing this practice . during abortion a  week old fetus wanes and opens their mouths to scream . roe v wade a landmark decision by the united states supreme court on the issue of abortion ,0
508,well  million means more diapers food and formula ,0
509,not become homeless or something stupid like what you said . if a law passes where there is no abortion if you do get one you will go to prision for murdering a baby . that is enough for a whole state ,0
510,what about if they do not have enough money ,1
511,just as a bungee jumper may die after his cord snaps he inadvertently consents to the possibility of death when he consents to act dangerously . if we recognise that an action is immoral then we ought to criminalise it simply because it is immoral just because it will not stop the action happening altogether it does not mean we ought to legalise it . often abortion actually harms womens mental health  so it would be not necessarily help to have an abortion after being raped . my opponent mentions that to force a woman to keep the child of the rapist is incredibly immoral but he does not justify this assertion . to summarise women who die in illegal abortions bring it upon themselves nobody forced them to have an abortion . this is because there is currently less of a stigma towards single parenthood so less social pressure to abort and medical hygiene has improved on a general scale  . rebuttal of argument  the next argument in favour of the morality of abortion is that it should be allowed in cases where the child has extreme birth defects . therefore as foetuses are in a temporary state of unconsciousness we ought not to kill them . rebuttal of argument  my opponents first argument roughly states that the value of a human life is its consciousness and therefore a foetuss lack of consciousness is the moral justification for killing it . if we are to make a correct ethical decision then we ought not to be influenced by pity . he does not voice his opinion on whether patients in temporary comas should be kept alive but i will assume that he agrees they should be ,0
512,now having it after the  trimester is bad due to the fact it not only purges a human life it also leaves not only physical scaring but emotional scaring as well for the woman . i believe abortion should not be illegal for the simple fact that her body is hers alone no one can tell her to or not to have an abortion . if a female choses to have an abortion it is her right as a female ,1
513,i personally say abortion should be legal but not punished before the point of fetal pain ,0
514,instead they think that the fetus is under a certain category of existence where the organism is acceptable to be killed ,0
515,definitions explanations early abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy . the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age . medical non surgical abortions using medications such as mifepristone  are available in some clinics ,1
516, i concede that repetitive abortions over and over would feel wrong on a moral level but i direct you back to my original argument if any woman had the ability to sleep around without protection and solve it with an abortion every time she does not have the right to care for a child at all . adoption is the last resort I have already explained the downfalls of this but i still feel that a forced pregnancy will do no good for anyone sure the child will experience life but life only appears to be good to us because we are alive an embryo a sperm or an egg has no desire to be born . what then is the issue of aborting an early embryo ,1
517,hillary clinton during the  presidential debate stated that we cannot be forcing women to give birth to children . it is proven science that fetuses have beating hearts and are human which means killing them is called . so know we are killing innocent children and the government is wasting peoples hard earned money on it ,0
518,if the people seeing this are going to vote according to technicality you win by far but if their judging on who actually cares and who is morally sound . about infanticide i said that it would be only logical to assume harmless little   and  trimester abortions would lead to that . i do not think our founding fathers would if ever possible look into the future and enjoy seeing the fetal products of their hardwork sucked out and utterly destroyed ,0
519,the medical termination of pregnancy act  permits abortion to be performed only when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health or when there is a substantial risk of the child being born with physical or mental abnormalities so as to be seriously handicapped . so you are standing with this statement south korea is the only country that equalized its male female ratio and it was a country that legalized ssa and enforced it vigorously . in conclusion i have successfully defended  safeguarding health of women  ending female  proper care to the girl child  ethical perspective sex ratio  reduction in poverty  stabilization of  improvement in status of women there seems to be some ambiguity here . it will reinforce the gender prejudices and people would cash in on these and there would be no way for the government to check these because they would not breaking any law . keep in mind that the government has not passed this law due to moral reasons but because they anticipate a social imbalance .  any law which legalizes ssa must take care to ensure that there is explicit consent of the woman . wars yes the mating prospects would increase but that would not lead to an increase in status instead it will result in declining status alright better mating prospects will only result in an increased status if women utilize better mating prospects to demand an increased status . i do not see a drastic change in the amount of respect given to a wife no matter the ratio of males to females . my opponent believes that i do not see a drastic change in the amount of respect given to a wife no matter the ratio of males to females . uprooting a tree and killing a chicken are both examples of the humans taking the life of organisms . do you seriously believe that there will be so many successful rapes women who will get pregnant choose to give birth to the child fathers and mothers who will not look after the child to the point that there will be an increase in poor people . so what you are saying is  we some women do not want to perform ssa and we want to discourage  we same women will reward people who perform ssa by marrying them i do not see why the children need to be illegitimate no no no . they may voluntarily choose not to do so because they have gained a cushy life by marrying up . if they can find a mate it will be in their interest the principle is similar to respecting other people s right to life to not perform rapes . i e it does not allow the parent to discard the child as long as it does not infringe on the personal health of the mother or the child . the argument pointed out that the social structure of india is not favourable for legalizing ssa . increased pressure to marry while females would be essentially devoid of these things would not actively pursue these things since a better life good rich er husband . caste considerations would become irrelevant when compared to not getting a mate at all . however i pointed out that the burden cannot be placed on the people who opt for ssa ,1
520,i suppose if my opponent wishes to dispute it that is his her its perogative but it will not jive with my nihilist argument for me to be simultaneously arguing against rights yet claiming that certain things are objectively morally wrong . conclusion i have blatantly wasted the time of both the reader s and of my honoured opponent . it is a distinct individual from the mother and being a seperate individual life that is human the most logical view is that it is a human being .  the conclusion follows from the premise and the axiom if babbies are indeed good and a fetus is a babby then it is logical to conclude that fetii r good . arguments the argument from lack of an argument as con i am able to assume a ridiculously sceptical position as my opponent has the burden of proof . direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law since this does not appear to reserve first round for acceptance alone i will attempt to counter my opponents arguments .  arguments based on moral grounds are acceptable when it comes to this topic . the first statement is axiomatic in it is veracity there are few who would claim that babbies r not good . since you need to affirm the claim that a woman has a right to an abortion . any and all arguments based on moral grounds are unacceptable when it comes to this topic . voting for a sexist is prima facie immoral thus you must vote for me if my opponent contends this ,0
521,abortion should be illegal and i can give a few reasons . doctors every day who do not believe in abortion have to kill innocent babies and often suffer from ptsd . abortion is a harm to babies with absolutely no benefits ,0
522,ummmm that is not even a rebuttal that is just saying what we all already knew excluding of course the inaccuracy that this argument is not central to the debate . finally i request that you make an argument next round so here are a few pre rebuttals  the woman could get hurt in an abortion this is literally a maternal health thing if you do not use this argument in your final round i am not saying you think this . i never said you were against abortion because of painful death no claim was made . no it is not a reward but if there will be an extremely poor quality of life making them be born would be a punishment . would you like a drawn out ten year life of pain only then ending in death or would you rather not go through that ,1
523,major diformities and if a young girl is raped who has a body too young to produce children and it is much too emotionally difficult for a young girl to give birth to a child anyway please note by young child i mean under  abortion can stop her from dying in birth and the child from having to carry with him that his mom is a dead  year old . i believe that a women should be allowed to do what she pleases with her body and it should not be in the goverments control . extreme cases of brain damage  ,1
524,hill recognized is that believing the unborn to be fully human from the moment of conception requires an acknowledgement that they also are entitled to the same actions one would take to defend any other human being . while most would be abortive women are understandably reluctant to come forward and state that violent action saved their childs life there is at least one notable exception . if we knew that we or our loved ones were about to be killed as thousands of unborn children are each day we would defend one another with the means necessary . if questioned we would assert the moral necessity of taking this action . we would not limit ourselves to legal and educational remedies that might possibly stop the bloodshed in the future rather we would take the immediate action necessary to save one another ,0
525,for the record i will not be citing philosophers professors or any other person unless i take an idea directly from them ,0
526,the only reason i mentioend it hte way i did is because in that last post i responded to con ended with comparing it to a blob . at  weeks the baby is viable can live on its own . con seems to say if it is late in the pregnancy do not abort ,0
528,i certainly am not treating children like animals assuming that means how animals more likely to be treated cruelly quite the opposite i am asking you and others to consider that it is fundamental we consider actions to prevent greater harm and suffering and always striving to reduce the need for any extremities to accomplish such goals . and i must say i think your prognoses are ignorant of a vast amount of information on the subject this to me makes some of your positions seem very rude in considering all the aspects of these topics and how people deal with the agenda of abortion .  no females do not always have a choice in getting pregnant and based on your arguments against abortion you attempt to take chooses away from women by dismantling their basic right to choose to become a mother . the issue is usually to what degree of suffering can be determined though it certainly is an open subject but abortion is not entirely depended on it such a proposition . you are possibly i assume unconsciously trying to arouse certain emotions with terminology that signals to the reader s brain the association of a toddle or a born baby . it is very rare for women in the us to die as a result of pregnancy or childbirth that is a good thing and of those few many did not receive medical care during pregnancy . i did not ignore the choice of adoption i supported it i also briefly explained and gave you sources to review the consequences of the amount of children already put up for adoption in america and worldwide . i am under the impression you are not even researching anything on the subject as your response are not well balanced to the data on reality . i explain my reasons here i am arguing that suffering is a good thing to reduce which i stated at the beginning of my elaboration on the conclusion . the reasoning you are conveying is skewed and it is misleading you to believe you are not responsible for the outcomes of tomorrow because you did not act today . mothers who have had one or more children comprise over  of all abortions and women who do not have protected birth control accounts for only  of abortions i really did not expect you to reason people should only have sex for procreation ,1
529,partial birth abortion is murder even on the pro choice understanding of personhood ,0
530,given these criteria it logically follows that a human fetus cannot possess the same right to life that a grown adult has since it does not qualify as a person . since a fetus does not possess any of the above qualities it can rightfully not be considered a person . my reasons as to why it is not murder a fetus a fetus is not a rational or conscious agent and therefore does not hold a serious right to life ,1
531,picture this image for me a fetus or baby whatever word you would like to use with fingers toes fingernails toenails limbs etcf eatures me and you have and then the d x abortion procedure itself is rather gruesome . the abortion practitioner instrumentally reaches into the uterus grasps the fetus feet and pulls the feet down into the cervix .  protecting human life it is the core of the argument . since no premature infants were younger than  weeks it did not determine the earliest age at which the fetus would feel pain .  feeling pain yes o oa recent study examined the question of fetal pain through the direct measurement of cortical brain responses in premature infants . once the fetus has been delivered except for the head surgical scissors are forced into the base of the fetal skull and the its brains are sucked out . acog org more credible than your wikipedia sources you go on saying that my points are irrelevant although they defend my case and go against your points ,0
532,to win the debate con would need to prove that the law of hindered birth is not a law and he would need to prove that a woman cannot under any circumstances plan to have a child and then have that child . he has not made one single valid argument to challenge the or to prove that it does not the impact that abortion has on society . the fact is that all arguments about abortion are impacted in one sense or another by this law . con has made a normal pro life argument that is of no value to this debate . as stated above in the first round this debate will test a newly revealed natural scientific law that partially governs the impact that abortion has on society . it is indisputable that the egg and sperm of the wanted child are simply a wish away from conception . i have proved that the wanted child is more likely to be born than the unwanted child . his invalid arguments are  which has no impact because the situation of some women will change . the law says that forcing one life denies the possibility of another for  months . it does not matter to the law if the forced fetus is a human and it does not impact the birth of a wanted child . it says that if one life is forced then another is impossible . it does not matter if they are in fact the same as adults because any impact on the falls equally on the wanted and unwanted unborn . saving the unwanted destroys the possibility of the . the odds of birth for a planned child are nearly  percent and the odds of the unplanned about  percent . if a person forces the birth of an unwanted fetus then each  conceptions will yield  live children . the abstract child is not alive this is not part of the debate . the debate relates to the fact that the wanted child cannot be alive if the unwanted life is forced to birth . cons major error is that he fails to distinguish between law and theory . i have proved the unwanted unborn has a  percent chance of life and the wanted unborn has a nearly  percent chance of life ,1
533,it sounds like we have a concession ,1
534,thus for those reasons as well as the fact that there has been no response to any of my arguments i would ask for a vote in favour of the con . both form a philosophical and a scientific perspective there really is no doubt about whether a fetus at any stage of pregnancy is a living human person . i would argue that their right to choose stops short of taking the life of another human being ,0
536,for women who demand complete control of their body control should include preventing the risk of unwanted pregnancy through the responsible use of contraception or if that is not possible through abstinence . since life begins at conception abortion is akin to murder as it is the act of taking human life . abortion is in direct defiance of the commonly accepted idea of the sanctity of human life no civilized society permits one human to intentionally harm or take the life of another human without punishment and abortion is no different . in the instance of rape and incest proper medical care can ensure that a woman will not get pregnant . abortion should not be used as another form of contraception ,1
537,i did not mean that individual cases have separate consequences requirements only that the woman involved should be able at any time in the pregnancy to get an abortion with the advisory of a medical professional i only include them here for circumstances where the womans health might be at risk with it still being a morally just thing to do . a child is a significant investment on behalf of the parents and therefore it is immoral to force women who do not want a child to take on that heavy burden . if the potential parent feels they are not going to be a good parent for this child then why is it immoral to make sure they are not the parent to this child . secondly the opposition claim that getting an abortion is bad for the mother because of emotional stress again this is something she will consent to and provides no reason why abortion should not be allowed . if the parents want to have the child and give it away for adoption that is fine however if the mother thinks she will find it emotionally stressful and would rather an abortion she should be free to do just that . this argument seeks to define what a human is and once we have a definition it can fuel further discussion over the ethics of abortions . now of course all these will not apply to all women and of course people who want children take on these things voluntarily but think about someone who does not want to take on these extra challenges or someone who cannot afford it . now stick with me for this one because it is the most controversial part of this debate and involves philosophy . if my definition and analysis stands then we can conclude that it is moral to have an abortion as the foetus do not fulfill the requirements to be considered a human . the opposition wishes to use the fact that abortions because emotional stress to mothers and doctors . some pre rebuttal in the form as a point is that also the potential parent may not be okay with giving their child away . having a child is not right for everyone and by taking this option to prioritise the potential parent over the child you can ruin lives of the parents and the the children . to have dreams and ambitions is seen as something exclusively human and again it cannot be argued that a foetus posses this ability ,1
538,no one would doubt that the second killing was a but whatever else they might call it an accident a tragedy a misfortune no one would label the first scenario a precisely because it was not done intentionally . in one scenario you fail to notice that your elderly neighbor has just walked behind your car . that poses no ethical problems unless criterion  is met and the fetus turns out to be a . granted that no one can ever really know the intentions which motivate other individuals actions i would nevertheless argue that the burden of proving such a dastardly charge falls on those who would so impugn the medical profession especially in light of the cases in which physicians and nurses have fought hard to preserve the lives of viable post abortion fetuses . meeting this criterion alone is insufficient reason to label something a however because we often kill things in situations where no one would ever think of uttering the term . ok this will be my opening argument but let me first touch briefly on what con said . number three to be an action must involve the killing of life . all my work cited above is in this following link readressing your last statment if the abortion is done in an early stage it is not murder . english versions of the old testament may say but the meaning really is thou shalt not because killings in war in capital punishment and in self defense were long ago recognized as ethically justifiable forms of killing . if the life you kill is porcine bovine feline canine or anything other than then your action cannot ethically be described as . the answer is yes in  of all abortions the living content of the womb is killed . viruses bacteria rabid dogs drunk drivers sportsmen out hunting none of these really to harm or kill anyone and yet all of us have the right to try and protect ourselves from them . they claim that the intention to terminate a pregnancy also involves a determined effort to kill a person . as for criterion  is the human life killed in abortions . again the answer is yes because it is genetically human and belongs to no other species ,1
539,i am  I am not even graduated from high school my life is in so much chaos and uncertainty and i know i do not have the capability to be a mother nor should i have to carry the burden of someone elses decision within my womb . i do not want to put him or her up for adoption either because then that baby would know me as the mother that did not love them at all or was irresponsible and i can not live with that idea either . my life was invaded under false pretenses and thus i should not have to hold the burden of carrying this child . the life form is not technically human yet it has not developed to that point where it can be considered human . these conditions that have been placed onto me by forces outside of my own control is not fair . i am pro choice i support the decision made by the woman and her right to do with her body what she chooses and believe that the choice can only be made by the one with the life within them not by outside influences . i can not love something that only reminds me of the face and eyes of the man who raped me . if not i hear that god if he exists takes all the aborted children and takes care of them in heaven . i know my boyfriend sincerely believes that there is a way to get through this without aborting the child but i simply disagree with him ,1
540,definitions explanations restricted abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy . round  is for acceptance only no arguments to be presented in round  . the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age ,1
541,i might argue that this concession already cedes the entire debate if any instance of abortion can be considered appropriate then abortion should be considered legal . when we describe abortion as do we attach any qualification . however i will attempt a more thorough address of the instigators points ,1
542,i do not anticipate that i will be forfeiting this one so i think the debate will be uninterrupted . if a bundle of flesh can make no rational choices then it the duty of the mother universally agreed upon governing body to make that decision for it . definitions abortion a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy and because the death of the fetus . debate rules  pro will write his case in round  .  pro will abstain from posting any arguments or rebuttals in round  in order to ensure an equal number of rounds for both sides to debate ,0
543,nor is there any pre existing dormant consciousness as there would be in the case of a sleeping or comatose person ,1
544,i believe that abortion should not be legal one bit i do not believe that murder is right at all but if abortion is legal why do not they legalize killing people ,0
546,murder killing something living pro conceded that it is not living therefore it is not murder ,1
547,i however do not think abortion should be illegal if  the womans life is in danger  if the woman was raped and  if the fetus is very bad and I will meaning that it will probably die anyway ,0
549,if you take theology out of the argument there is simply no need for any govt involvement in the process beyond quality assurance ,1
550,again in response to the justification of animals being slaughtered i will save my response for another debate that is only dealing with proof that god does or does not exist which can then lead to a discussion of the factuality of the bible . i understand that for this debate we should only be focusing on the two issues i initially brought up so i will refrain as much as possible from my faith onto your arguments as i have complete respect for the many other beliefs people have and obviously yours to be specific . at first glance i thought you were trying to say that absolutely no other form of punishment existed but i now realize that you were trying to justify the death penalty in a society where absolutely no other form of punishment existed . my whole argument does not depend on the morality or immorality of the topic but rather depends on how i believe god would handle the situation . bible i personally will never try to push my faith on anyone that does not accept it but i will continue to use my faith as the foundation of my arguments . i will also go on to say that I am guessing this debate has no further meaning amongst either of us because my beliefs on abortion come from what i believe is in the bible . even if you were a vegetarian why would the issue of abortion be more pressing than these animals when the amount of animals slaughtered for consumption is notably greater than the fetuses being aborted in addition to the fact that the animals consumed are fully formed . and yes we do agree that the issue of adoption does become a lot more complicated but that has nothing to do with the proposition being a solution or not . it results in whether or not you think it is absolutely necessary for the woman to have an abortion . it is hard to take in the viewpoint of someone who says i do not believe in abortion but i would opt to have one under a certain circumstance . i am running out of characters to use for this argument and this would take me quite a while to show you the dozens of ways you are taking biblical text out of context but i will refrain and again encourage you to start up a debate dealing with this particular topic if you so choose to further my biblical arguments i have made ,0
551,before you argue that a child can not think research the facts first because according to www . etc a can have brain activity as early as three months after contraception . instead they should give the child to a family who is capable of caring for the child ,0
552,conclusion abortion has kept the crime rates lower and has saved womens lives from the dangers of home abortion . coat hangers as unpleasant as it sounds it is a method and most likely the most dangerous if the women missed the fetus and hit an internal organ that would mean the loss of the fetus and internal bleeding and injury or death of the woman . a women could induce the abortion of the pregnancy in many ways such as coat hangers bleach alcohol and pills all of which are very dangerous to the womens health and life ,1
555,now let me appeal to ypu better nature take a mental picture of a child who has been born and the mother wants and abortion that young human being could have grown up to e an amazing person .    little children at least   of those children could have presented something amazing and helpful toward our economy . when you stated that in some circumstances the mothers life is in danger the percentage is about  of the time that happens ,0
556,all of these points prove that women should be allowed to receive an abortion under the constitution and that women who receive abortion gain numerous benefits from it along with lowering the crime rates among other things . i would strongly encourage a vote for con in this debate . abortion reduces crime because and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion . i look forward to your conclusion and hope we can be friends hereafter . i thank my opponent for this wonderful debate and look forward to debating with him in the near future ,1
558,yet the american psychological association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion and that there was no evidence of post abortion syndrome . adoption is not an alternative to abortion because it remains the womans choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption .  risk of serious complications and do not affect a womans health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth . in the case of rape or incest forcing a woman made pregnant by this violent act would because further psychological harm to the victim . human life occurs at conception but fertilized eggs used for in vitro fertilization are also human lives and those not implanted are routinely thrown away . as it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord its health is dependent on her health and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb . this is definatley geting interseting however you did not have a direct link to your information your rebuttal but i managed to find it and would like to counter argue using the same source to even the playing field ,1
559,neither had a job and they knew that they could not afford to buy food and provided medical care for their baby . having a child who reminds you of such a horrible experience is not a nice thing . in pre pregnancy diabetes raises risk of birth defects donya  report that women diagnosed with diabetes before they become pregnant are three times to four times more likely to give birth to a child with one or even multiple birth defects than a non diabetic mother according to a study in the august. my friend got an abortion even though it was the hardest decision of her life . therefore no one has the right to tell a woman what she can or can not do with her body . another reason that women should be able to have abortions is in case the mothers are too young and unable to take care their babies . first women have the right to control their own bodies . if a woman gets pregnant and she has a history of heart disease then continuing the pregnancy would put both her and her baby at risk . therefore it is right if a woman chooses to get abortion in this case . however when a womans health is at risk or they will give birth to a child with defects then abortion would be better for the mother and for the baby . if we know the child will be born with defects then there is no point in having have the mother keep the baby if she chooses not to ,1
560,most women are older than  when they are pregnant and a  decrease in the quality of life is simply absurd . so if my opponent says that they should simply travel to each other then that would not work because either the man would not be in canada or the woman not in new zealand . i will address these in a moment but first i will support my claim about the balance of utility between a mother and her child . although it may seem that a mother should have the right to choose for those who cannot this is what is called virtual representation and is recognized as illegitimate in most systems . although good statistics are difficult to find it is safe to say that as nearly  percent of births are unintended  living conditions for those born by accident are not by necessity lower than those of their parents . my opponents only argument against this is that the quality of life for the child will be worse . while rape and the possibility of death are certainly things we would rather avoid it is selfish to value the possibility of worsening part of ones life over the certainty of completely losing all of it ,0
561,i know that if those mothers can give their babies in adoption instead of killing them because they will find someone that adopts them and loves them . as abortion is illegal in some places we have to take into account that . however we are not discussing the moral implications of abortion just the selfish aspect ,1
562,the parent is imprisoned and the child starves to death wow great solution instead of one person suffering now that is assuming abortion is murder we have two . there are many cases and many instances where a child can ruin ones life or even the whole families life . sources were provided and did you honestly think that abortion would stop if it were illegal ,1
563,and even if that is your true motive why should one woman get to force another woman to have a baby for her .  most women that cannot conceive are looking to adopt a newborn if we passed a law such as this they are would be more babies for those women . we can not assume that those women could have abortions no more than we can assume that your proposed victims can give their kids up for adoption . I am pro abortion but there is absolutely no reason to assume the victims of those scientists were pro abortion .  abortions should only be allowed before the end of the womens first trimester the first  months after the first three months the only option for the unborn child should be adoption . i doubt that your belief is based on the thousands of women who can not conceive . would you change your mind about abortion if new fertility treatments fixed them .  this is my belief because there are thousands of women who cannot conceive and some are grief stricken for that reason . the embryo is not a person there is nobody to punish ,1
565,so i think the abortion should be legalize because for example if there is a mother with a lesser earning and have got a devorse from his husband how can she give a birth suppose there are no good relatives also so how can she give a birth to a child ,1
566,I am ready when you are ,0
567,also if con had actually read my argument instead of skimming it they would see that the beginning of my argument was addressing this i will now point out that con has contradicted him herself .  it is funny that you even made this into a contention oh what ever shall i do i misspelled the word . do really i need to mention that you have not used any sources of any kind whatsoever in your past two pathetic excuses for rebuttals . however we are not discussing the moral implications of abortion just the selfish aspect . con is saying that it is nonsense to bring a child into the world if they are unloved . most rich middle class women who get abortions are doing so cheifly for their own benifit most of the time at the overall expense of the child . this is the definition of selfish that is used in this debate s own personal profit or pleasure . i know that if those mothers can give their babies in adoption instead of killing them because they will find someone that adopts them and loves them . i would like to point out this part of cons statement specifically one of the worst thing that could happen to someone is having parents who do not love him .   lastly i want to emphasise the generalising nature of the resolution . con states that one of the worst thing that could happen to someone is having parents who do not love him ,0
568,and the last reason it should be illegal in principal is because the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy . the pro and con about human life here are enough to say in principle we should defer to human life but not clear enough to make any meaningful punishments for it . the common arguments in favor of abortion should be used here as holistic approach to why she should be able to decide given the various moral considerations involved . but on the other hand the earliest cell does meet the requirements for what would constitute an organism albeit it would probably be viewed as more like a parasitic organism given it must live off of the mother . i would take that same reasoning though and argue that it is such a strong consideration that it should at least be illegal albeit with no legal consequences . while the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy she may have tried her best not to get pregnant and got pregnant anyways . aside from rape abortion should be illegal in the first trimester but not investigated nor punished ,0
569,the thing with abortion after the nervous system is pretty much fully finished developing is that at that point it really is a human being as in they can feel they have a working brain they can move . i believe that females have a right as a human being to not go through the birth process and abort the fetus because there is not enough reason to take this right from them in a secular nation where you have a right to do anything that does not take away the rights of anyone else . abortion does not actively take away the rights of any people ,1
570,as for the assumption that i can not have science alongside my argument and still have morality this is false . the only organs that would not be touched are those organs which are absolutely necessary for the life of an individual . since a mom v fetus scenario does not exist than we can safely rule that this is an irrelevant point . my criteria is the superior criteria because it actually shows that not everything is a person it is based on a rational empirical view of the world rather than the vague science denying notions of my opponent and it actually includes people who are sleeping as people people sleeping do not tick off any boxes in that   checklist . my opponent says that i am wrong because usage of science which cares not for morality means that i can not prove that i am moral but i can prove that abortion is the act of a human killing a human . in fact i can say that the two are intertwined but that is a discussion of personal philosophy that is inappropriate for this debate venue . bodily autonomy when i said that the flood gates were not open i meant that was a hyperbole that did not truly apply . i said that there are situations in which abortion will end in less death and that those situations are acceptable nothing else . from what i understood from their first argument i can conclude that this is when a zygote dies on its own and is than removed . secondarily my definition of people is directly contrasting to this so much that i need not expressly deny it .  mom v fetus my opponent failed to address the fact that a scenario where it is mom vs a fetus does not really exist today . when you say that science points out that your criteria has problems in practice which is self admitted you point out a fatal flaw . it is even worse to kill somebody who can not say no and can not stand up for themselves . though in this last round i will likely come off as a little annoyed i promise that this is not the case . if they are killed by another human than it is murder . cons neg util  bodily autonomy previously covered  prevention of suffering and risks death stopping death does justify anything and everything except causing more death to do so . it may not be as capable of using that knowledge as humans are but it still has that knowledge . now to the rest of my rebuttal . also considering recent advancements in technology it will not be too long before organ donation will be less necessary than before I am not going to provide a source otherwise this crosses the line from rebuttal to new point ,0
571,jesse jackson you s civil rights activist now in favor of legal abortion in national right to life news january  there are those who argue that the right to privacy is of higher order than the right to life . the woman may ordinarily have a reasonable right to control her own body but this does not confer on her the entirely separate and insupportable right to decide whether another human lives or dies . all other rights including the mother s right to choice surely stem from a prior right to life if you have no right to any life then how do you have a right to an autonomous one ,1
572,abortion should be banned because abortion is murder and taking away an unborn childs chance at life ,0
573,until we can say that you will not get a baby is you use this super condem or any other form of  effective birth control we should not take abortions away . we shou d be attempting as a society to produce children that are wholesome and grow up in a happy and healthy household with both parents who care for them as that will produce the best results for a society to grow . i would like to now point out that by requesting an abortion the mother is stating that she cannot care for does not want or cannot have the child inside her body . i will go more in depth into this later on in the debate . well it is because we need to offer the women a foolproof option of getting rid of a child that will not be loved cared for and was a stake weather by not having it made in the first place or by cutting it off before it is born . coupled with the html  error and the bell internet crash in canada i have not had ddo for around  hours . so with  minutes left till i forfeit the round and most probably the debate i will post my argument ,1
574,the only scenario where grammar or puncuation is used as a voting factor is if the arguement is so illegible that the voter has a hard time following . if a woman does not realize she is pregnant until the second trimester than she should woman up and have the baby like a non egotistical sociopath killer of a mother . i can make an argument that you broke all of them and that is all i need to win this debate anyways . voters please look at his sources and tell me if they are credible in any way shape or form . both of these sources are sketchy as hell and they are both fvcking blog posts written by people who have no evidence of any kind to back up their bullshlt opinions . on top of this you made three errors just in your last statement . but seriously kid are you in fvcking elementary school ,0
575,while it is true that the spinal cord is important to the nervous system it is not an end in and of itself .  weeks which is the standard almost globally is well short of that meaning that according to our current science the fetus does not feel pain thus refuting a common argument that of the fetus feeling pain  my body my choice the fetus is completely dependent upon the mother while in the womb for its nutrition etc .  while you are reading this a child is dying because of an adults ignorance . let us start with some definitions . however it goes on to say that the pain receptors are not connected to the brain until   weeks . this means that the fetus can be considered a part of a mothers body . nathans an early proponent became a pro life campaigner after he saw a  week old fetus scream during an abortion . i fail to see how this is relevant to your case and these figures should they actually be true are actively harmful as they suggest a very small minority of abortions are after  weeks . anyhow for those who are too lazy to read it it says in essence that at  weeks pain receptors are widespread and therefore the fetus feels pain possibly at that point .  by  weeks a fetus has formed a spine which means the fetus can feel pain . we give freedom in our society for people to do what they want with their body generally ,0
576,i will try to cover as many points as i can first of all stating that it was murder for the sake of convience is simply too patronizing to what i was trying to convey abortion is an essential requirement for those who cannot afford to bring up their children as i mentioned with the poverty issue and women themselves do not ask to be raped and they are forced to concieve a child that they were probably aware that from the start they could not bring up . b if anything prostitution and drug laws should complement abortion as there is little chance a child can be brought up properly if a prostitute gets pregnant . however my points do link together  of abortions are made because the womans life would have been changed too much this also includes cases of rape ,1
577,just like an acorn has the potential to become an oak tree ,1
578,now about you saying if a condom breaks there can be consequences like pregnancy and stds and how i would not wish for someone to have to keep an std if they did not have to your right i would not wish that on someone yet a child is not a disease it lives it breathes it has a heartbeat and if the parents are too poor or young or old or sick there are answers for all of those too young they should not be sleeping together too sick they should not be pregnant be because they should not be having sex and too poor or old adoption . plus with abortion being only wrong if you are not blessed enough to be set up in a good environment to raise it in that is wrong I am a bastard child my self and i mean that in the since of my parents were not married when they had me but my mom was  and my dad was  and had just got out of the service neither had a job and they both came from a long line of alcoholics who made very little money most doing hard labor . i have two friends that are twins that were adopted there parents had them young but went to the group and found a nice family to take them in that did not have kids and now they own one of the biggest swimming holes in the area make tons of money every summer they have a great life and are normal kids ,0
579,none of this evidence follows or aligns with almost any other scientific research done on this subject while a fetus may be a life it does not start to develop characters that humans share until around   weeks . in fact  of all abortions in the united states are obtained within the first   weeks . the next logical question one may ask is whether or not it is a human life . and what about abortion in cases where it could danger a mother s life what happens in a situation where the mother could die from the pregnancy . these are just a few facts on how many pregnancies can be fatal . i would argue for the fact that the fetus would have to exhibit pain feelings emotion and conscious . this varies from state to state and is also a huge reason that late term abortion is banned ,1
580,i would prefer to win the battle of ideas not the battle of government force as this is both more moral according to me and would lead to a much longer enduring outcome . here are some basic reasons why i support the legalisation of abortion while not supporting the practice in any way i want to avoid back ally abortions which are considerably more likely to because serious harm or death to the mother . post script i should add that it is somewhat strange to see a so called libertarian proposing fascist regulations on what women can or cannot do with their own bodies ,0
581,but the mother should just deliver the baby and raise him her just like any normal human being . based on the word and are living organisms . i think they should because abortion can because mental disruption ,0
582,my opponent does not define moral rights and provides no grounds on which to assert why natural rights which are themselves arbitrarily defined by a few men some centuries ago must be obeyed at all times . for example i could decree from now on that any person who drinks water must not collect their pay check next month i could similarly argue that any person not responsible enough to obey this decree is unfit to drink water . i explained my utilitarian views in  and i welcome him to rebut it here or in another debate although i may not do another debate in a long time . the counter balance is if someone else who is intelligent cared about the inepts rights for them brutally put this is called property ownership having custody of a child or otherwise inept people is a cross between owning the person and giving them rights . my opponent states that abortion must involve killing the fetus and sites the merriam webster dictionary . i say that abortion should not be illegal at any stage because the mother is the sole person who understands rights who is affected at any time before birth . the full definition states that abortion is the termination of a pregnancy after accompanied by resulting in or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus . we observe the definition of a sycamore a tree of the eastern and central you s that has light brown bark that peels off in thin flakes . i answer that because it is already known that the fetus will very likely to be a burden on society . i do not believe that everything should be placed on rights and i explained practically why not . my opponent uses an unfitting analogy by comparing the result of abortion as solely the death of the fetus . con then states that abortion is not successful unless the fetus dies but i showed why this is not true in the definitions paragraph . the reason i do not think society should actively seek out the burdens is because of the energy involved in seeking them which are in general much better spent doing actually useful things ,1
585,even though sex feels good it does not justify killing the unborn child that comes as a result of it . read argument  and the reasons that i believe i should add here . if they are not ready for a child then they do not have sex ,0
586,the order that the rights are listed in is important because they go in progression from the most fundamental . this is a prejudice based solely on a single characteristic of the other person that attempts to dehumanize them in one fashion or another . our system of law is also based on the existence of fundamental human rights . the us founding fathers described these fundamental rights in the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness . this is not to be confused with privileges granted by the state such as the right to drive vote etc . one has no liberty if they do not have the right to life . my final argument will be that the law already recognizes the responsibility of parents to provide for the needs of their children failure to provide the necessities of life everyone is under a legal duty as a parent foster parent guardian or head of a family to provide necessaries of life for a child under the age of sixteen years ,0
587,the impact of the argument with respect to the resolution pertains to whether or not a fertilized egg is a human being . pro did not rebut the argument that the fact of illegal abortions constitutes greater injustice than making them illegal therefore it stands . the argument shows that since none of the ceremonies and traditions applied to human beings are applied to fertilized eggs it is therefore clear that society does not consider a fertilized egg to be a human being . if a fetus and child were human beings of equal status then pro could not possible grant an exception that allowed a fetus to be aborted in the case of rape . i plainly reasserted human rights as additional value criteria in the evaluation of whether justice is done . precisely what i asked for was an example of the that has occurred as a traceable consequence of abortion having been legalized for the past fifty years ago . it is the course of making the argument that pro implicitly acknowledges that there is critical difference between a fetus and a child . i do however point out that a reasonable interpretation of pros offer is that under those circumstances reason would be allowed to prevail . pro made the argument that this is not about rights but that argument was rebutted on the grounds that justice cannot be evaluated without general consideration of rights as well as . no asserting that the standard of human worth applies does not of itself tell us whether the application of the standard to the fertilized egg supersedes its application to the woman .  the correct definition of is obtained by looking up the phrase which yields ,1
588,by killing a child you are taking away his or her chance to benefit or contribute to society in any way . my opponent said that abortion is not murder because the child does not know it . it does not make sense to say that murdering a child is not murder because the child does not know it . i would like to thank my opponent for a great debate about this topic and i urge the judges to vote against abortion . and given the fact that   of women have an abortion the number of breast cancer cases is a lot . in this situation if i used an appeal to emotion i would have made the person i was trying to persuade feel an emotion in order to convince them . if a person truly does not want their baby then they can send it to adoption . i want to take a step back a minute and look at the argument of abortion as a whole . even if abortion was the reason crime rate went down and abortion became illegal we can still keep the crime rate down by sending these kids to the adoption center and get a good family and live a good life . my last argument is that babies are alive and are technically us citizens by law . if you go to the websites they both say that if doctors are in utter refusal to do an abortion then they will lose their job . irish times org they both say that the reason abortion rates do not plummet is because doctors jobs are on the line . rather than not care for them and have them grow up and be on drugs and commit crimes . a child even if not born has a right to live no matter what . according to fafsa org if you are alive even before birth and you are in the us then you are a us citizen ,0
589,i do want to close with this abortion is legal murder the baby has the right to live also i want to add that there are more people that apply for adoption than the amount of babies in the hospital . a side note abortion is never necessary to save a womans life and pro choice always use the argument about rape and incest . the unborn baby will only be there for nine months which is a short time in comparability to a lifetime marred with shame guilt and sorrow ,0
590, it is speciesism humans declaring their own in the biological sense gives them personhood and thus excludes others who are not of that particular dna set . as such the first argument here is to impose such a liability in the case of the violinist or cpr is bad law to begin with thus the legal consistency argument is rejected on those grounds . we could grant that the burden imposed on the person doing cpr is minimal compared to interest of saving a self aware intelligent human .  if god exists god or any non material entity that is self aware and intelligent not only is excluded because it has no human dna but is excluded regardless of what material criteria you use for personhood . but as far as this argument goes con does not dispute that billionaires can not be forced to give up most of their wealth to save self aware intelligent suffering humans as such i maintain how dis proportional it is to demand that women give up more to save less . accepting this does not get you to forced continuation of pregnancy because as alluded to before the burden imposed on the woman is much higher and the interest in the early stages of pregnancy of a non self aware non intelligent human organism is much lower . if abortion is murder reducto argument con puts forth the idea that abortion be illegal but not on the grounds of murder something much less something that one would pay a fine for like a speeding ticket perhaps . the argument is that you would make your decision based on various criteria such as self awareness intelligence ability to feel pain ergo  year old child over   day human embryos .  if con just claims okey self aware aliens and gods are persons too then it just becomes ad hoc making it up as you go along and frankly denying the obvious your only including those things based on a capacity mental criteria yet will not admit as such because your using a materialist human dna criteria for personhood to deny abortion rights . there are all sorts of counters to this well you went out late at night wearing that you know that rapists exists ergo you consented to rape . cons law consistency arguments self defeatingthe reasoning that con has used for their arguments and counter arguments is to invoke some prior legal law then argue that allowing abortion is inconsistent with that law and thus to make it consistent abortion should be illegal in the name of said legal consistency . cons law consistency argumentcon makes the point that allowing abortion laws could be wrong yes which is why i present argument more than just abortion is legal so argument is over . either con agrees abortion is murder is a false premise or con still wants to leave open the option that abortion is murder in which case his remarks are all one big distraction ,1
591,the irony is I will probably lose this debate due to vote bombing ,1
592,advocating that the government remove legal restrictions on a medical procedure is the very thing that prevents the unfortunate back alley and home abortions . younger women are encourage to seek counself from their parents but should not be quired to inform them or thave them to consent to a procedure . i do not need to win all six points in my constructive to win this speech this is completely abusive and was not agreed upon before the debate . my opponent fails to answer my argument that spouses can be abusive or hard to contact and can have undue influence over their womans right to an abortion . this procedure is called intact dilation and extraction is rarely necessary to preserve the life of a woman in later term . women who resort to these unfortunate choices often due so because of legal restrictions placed upon them . the womans level of mental development is irrelevant in determining her right to an abortion ,1
593,i know that abortion is the womans right to kill the baby but they are just giving away lives that have just been born and i think that those lives deserve to live in this world no matter the case ,0
594,i meant this to mean it could live without the mother ,0
595,my detractor will say that what made it murder and immoral is that he did not gain her consent since consent seems to be the grand arbiter these days . after the libation was handed to her she noticed a powdery residue on the rim of her cup . to confirm her suspicions she took the drink to a laboratory for chemical analysis which determined that mifepristone was mixed in to her drink ,1
596,however i do not need to defend late term abortions rather my opponent needs to prove to us why abortion is categorically wrong in all cases and why the rights of the fetus supplant the rights of the moher . what if the fetus has a severe abnormality and will not survive the course of the pregnancy . however she needs to back up this claim and demonstrate to us why this must be the case bearing in mind that appeals to religion and ensolument cannot establish a universal framework since of course not everyone follows her brand of religion or even any religion . this certainly would not extend to the entirety of the pregnancy that is most people would agree that there is a good argument for restricting late term abortions . i accept this debate and will be arguing con for the following resolution it is wrong to have an abortiondefinitions abortion the termination of a pregnancy after accompanied by resulting in or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus  wrong  obviously pro in affirming this resolution and instigating this debate will possess the sole burden of proof to demonstrate to us that abortion is categorically wrong . to uphold her own bop she must demonstrate that objective morality exists and that abortion is objectively wrong in all cases . my opponent could make the case that this occurs at conception though legal rights are not conferred until viability per roe v wade .  extreme casesfor my opponent to prove to us that abortion is categorically wrong she must prove that it its therefore wrong in every case without exception . however this does not impact that right at all if a fetus is aborted the fetus is by definition not born ,1
597,would aborting the baby change history and totally erase the rape in every way shape and form . even when i debate my liberal friends about abortion they shut off when i ask those questions i eagerly await my opps rebuttals  . in order to defend this position further my opp would have to answer the following questions  . yes there is pain involved i can attest to that more on that in a bit but not every moment is pain as i can attest why or how can i attest to this . there is no reason why someone should abort a baby due to a deformation . i am by all intents and purposes a productive memeber of society as are several other people with spina bifida even the ones who do not walk google gabriel gigout . is it the unborn babys fault the woman got raped ,0
598,on the right to life it is undeniable that before  weeks after fertilisation the foetus cannot be said to be conscious or sentient . even if we accept pros studies and we ought not to there are a number of things which correlate to a higher chance of depression and cancers drinking alcohol being a prime example . assuming pros stat of  weeks is valid and frankly I am not qualified to say whether it is or not then  of abortions occur when the foetus does not have a central nervous sytem of any kind and therefore is not conscious and therefore is incapable of suffering in any meaningful way . we should also consider the health effects of someone not having an abortion . asterisks nb the statistics on source  are listed in terms of weeks after gestation not fertilization . if we were to take that claim to its logical progression we would have to observe that sperm and egg cells are also capable of becoming a living human . pregnancies also correlate with a risk of cancers due to forcing the body to rapidly to accomodate the foetus ,1
599,are yu for it or against it ,0
601,a full school year is tough without a pregnancy but with it the teen may have symptoms of depression . the student will have to walk around with all the extra weight that she did not even want in the first place . they may also have to cope with people at school talking about her ,1
602,it is not by definition killing by that logic eating eggs is abortion and so is eating any form of seeds but noone blinks an eye at those thing so what is a big deal ,1
603,just as the liberal creed goes a human life by how far along down the road of life he is on and we should not judge a human by whether he is conscious or not . let me propose my pro life argument in the form of a question if you pro abortionists could be convinced beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever that an embryo was a human life would you recant your abortion stance . using this argument is it ethical to kill a newborn solely based on the fact that it is not by our standards . there is a dichotomy in this debate and if you are you essentially condone the act of abortion since you do not condemn it . how then do you justify killing something that has no awareness of itself on the sole basis that it does not have awareness of itself ,0
604,you have done this deed in secret but i will bring it about in the presence of all israel and with the sun looking down . as we can see he orders abortion and murder all the time  its widely accepted if not by all chirstians that aborted children souls go to heaven . you can not punch someone in the face while telling them not punch people in the face because its wrong  chirstians are not being taught the bible correctly or they would have to believe god ordered women to have an abortion . samuel    killing more children wrong hosea   every pregnant woman here gets a divine abortion those are just a few examples of god going crazy with murder and abortion . to further my point god has no regard for life he consistently has people killed or killed them himself but for some reason chirstians are being taught humans are special and god values all life .  wrong next we headed for the land of bashan where king og and his army attacked us at edrei . the fact he has ordered the death of unborn children its reasonable to say god ordered the woman to have the abortion as part of his divine plan ,1
605,i say no it should not be legal i only see it able to be legal is if it is rape other then that it was their choice to have sex and they know the consequences of that action s ,0
606,sure you might see some on the news media on tv saying how they are glad to be alive and progressing but that is on tv . that is an opinion but I am sure if you talk to just about anyone with a deadly disease anyone like a quad or someone who can not function they will will tell you that they rather be dead than to go through what they do . it is always pro life or pro choice and arguments from both sides the parent is left out in the dark with no consideration about their well being at all more so than the baby in fact which is sad . i know this because I have spoken to many online and they are miserable and the way they express themselves also shows that they are without even needing to say a single word . last i checked I am in the usa last i checked we got something most other countries do not and you know what that is . so to me it would seem the majority would rather be non existent . with an abortion there is several factors as I have listed that could potentially be wrong with the baby ,1
607,abortion can also be dangerous for mothers because there is a chance the doctor will mess it up and the mother would be harmed ,0
608,i thank  for a good debate and hope to debate again sometime in the near future ,1
609,however the odds are still in favour of it being correct in general so i will provide an example of a situation in which abortion would be best for both mother and child in my arguments section .  sorry for the late response i just got a spike of homework so i did not have much time to do debating as con has taken the pro life side i will assume that i no longer need to argue that there are cases in which abortion is not ethical as we are in agreement on that so i will not rebut any of your rebuttals to my statements saying that abortion can be unethical . to avoid any guessing over the time i will assume that the baby is conscious at a little past  weeks since the parts of the brain for thought and emotion are more complex than the parts for motor control . in a case where an embryo or fetus has a lethal birth defect it only makes sense to abort it rather than forcing it to be carried for  months with this and then be born only to have their brain painfully destroyed . therefore even though we can not read minds and so do not know the exact time that a baby is conscious we do know that a baby definitely has no consciousness until it has a brain that is at least partially developed . however i am arguing that there are cases in which abortion should be allowed and cases in which it should not so the fact that i did not disprove some of your points does not cost me the debate . to do so to an unborn child for the same reason these entire premise of these two paragraphs is that a zygote is already a human as i have proven above is potentially false and i will prove later that it is actually false ,1
610,maybe i should have just said abortion is similar instead of identical to nazi ideologies ,0
611,pro also states if you think that these questions do not matter and that all that matters to you is your life than you clearly have not yet matured enough to develop enough empathy to be able to truly understand the decision your mother has to make . pro proceeds to say the government doesns past present or future or what may happen if the baby is born for all they know the mother was raped the mother has a deadly illness the baby could have a horribly painful life ending in a painful death or the mother and the baby could both die if the baby is born . i have further proof that fetuses are human naral a pro abortion organization has even admitted that a fetus is a human being there is simply no doubt that even the early embryo is a human being . as to being there is no doubt that it exists is alive is self directed and is not the same being as the mother and is therefore a unified whole . he later states if judy nicastro hadn t had her abortion the baby would have had a miserable life that probably would have ended in a painful death as hard as it was for the mother she had to make the right decision to let her baby die in very little to no pain in a warm and loving place . scientists say in order for something to be alive it has to be capable of growth reproduction and metabolism . as I have said before it is completely immoral to take a human being s life to save your own . however i do not agree with abortion because the fetus is not part of the woman . pro also states see that it says and scientifically in order to be alive you must be able to eat breath and defecate . the possibility of dying is no excuse for murder . in order it win this debate i must prove that a fetus is a human being . once again abortion kills a fetus a fetus is human and therefore abortion is murder . this is because she believes that abortion does not fit the definition of murder . as stated earlier in my rebuttal see rebuttal  a fetus is the same as a human . case i will explain this again this whole argument is based on whether or not a fetus is in fact living and human . pro mentioned a story about a woman who aborted one of her twins because it had a hernia .  pro also said that fetuses cannot eat breathe or defecate . i am absolutely for women s rights and i respect your opinion . pro states i think that the definition you wrote is quite incorrect and i think you purposefully wrote one that would justify your argument . to begin pro seems to disagree with the fact that abortion is murder . also a fetus has no such concept of empathy and like you said it does not grasp the whole situation ,0
612,by not allowing women to have an abortion we are harming the economy womens health and individual rights . a person and their doctor should be allowed to make the decision that they think will be right for their health and their future . it is that persons individual choice to do what is morally right or wrong as long as they do not break the law ,1
613,i would turn the question around to my opponent if the child will experience no suffering due to an early abortion why make the rape victim suffer . thus in regards to the other two cases namely in cases of severe genetic or developmental deformities to save the child from sufferingexample a child who is developing in the womb with organs on the outside of its body and its prognosis were it to live would be an excruciating child birth followed by no more than a day or two of life consisting of constant pain and suffering . you are then forced into a lengthy and expensive court battle to try and get the child into adoption . i invite my opponent to fill in the argument with additional premises in order to make the argument valid . my opponent has adamantly held to the following argument premise  the unborn child is not at fault for the rapepremise  an abortion does not change history and because the rape to have not occurredpremise  an unborn child morally deserves the chance to liveconclusion in cases of rape aborting an unborn child is completely immoralthis argument is not valid as the conclusion does not logically follow from the truth of the premises .  i would like to now focus attention onto my opponents arguments against the third case i presented in cases of rape .  my opponent seems to have a misunderstanding of how often rapists actually stand trial . specifically premise  an unborn child morally deserves the chance to livepremise  a rape victim morally deserves to be freed of being retraumatized by the rapepremise  being forced to carry the rapists child results in daily retraumatizing the rape victimthereforepremise  a rape victim morally deserves not to be forced to carry the rapists childpremise  the only way for the unborn child to live is for the mother to carry the child to termpremise  for a rape victim to not be forced to carry the rapists child she must have the choice to abort the childtherefore premise  premise  and premise  are incompatible and it is impossible for both moral requirements to be metpremise  in the case of conflicting moral requirements the moral choice is the one which results in the least human sufferingpremise  aborting a child before it has developed a nervous system a brain any consciousness or means of experiencing existence results in no human sufferingpremise  forcing a mother to carry the rapists child can result in daily and extreme human sufferingtherefore from    and  conclusion the moral choice is to allow the mother the option of aborting the child while still undeveloped which would result in zero suffering by the child and would prevent great suffering by the motherthis argument is valid as the conclusion logically follows from the premises . in comparison a child aborted before it gains any nervous system brain or means of experience would not suffer at all ,1
614,neither pro nor anyone else would allow a child to be killed at age three on the grounds of the child being the product of a rape . if there is an independent which is separate from human rights we must still resolve the conflict between this alleged new right or whatever it is and the rights of the woman and of others in society . from the viewpoint of society this is a substantially greater injustice than terminating a fertilized egg . unfertilized eggs sperm and a surgically removed appendix are all because they are all the products of human dna and of nothing else . pro seeks to have all abortion made illegal including situations in which the fertilized egg is a microscopic undifferentiated sphere of a few hundred cells . the question then arises as to what is due to a fertilized egg versus what is due to the woman and to others potentially impacted by legislation making abortion illegal . even if it were accepted that it is unjust to destroy a fertilized egg which i do not grant it is greater injustice to violate the rights of the woman to govern her own body . a just society should honor the rights of woman above any supposed injustice to fertilized eggs . that is because there is implicit recognition that fertilized eggs are not human beings and therefore does not give a fertilized egg what is due to a human being . pro implicitly acknowledges that fertilized eggs are not human beings by providing the exception for rape in his assertion . there are no movements to develop heroic technologies to save them nor to afford the burial traditions of religions . when pro grants the exception to allow abortion over concern for the health of the woman pro grants that the woman has a greater right to live than the unborn . pro illustrates by claiming that there is a right against that exists independent of human rights ,1
615,what i believe my opponent was trying to say though was that the forced termination of human life is . her third point is that some women will feel sad for having an abortion . she maintains that because killing is therefore abortion is also . who are we to expect pregnant women to voluntarily donate their body and life support systems to something else . this is supported by the national center for health statistics own statistics . if we can assume that preventing life to become life is in fact killing then every moment you are not engaging in the act of reproduction you are killing potential life . but even if a fetus were a human being its still would not trump the rights of the mother ,1
616,i am glad that you agree ,0
617,third my opponent claims that since the woman is capable of terminating the pregnancy it is just to do so that is the same thing as saying that because i could rob a bank or kill a kindergarten class it is justified to for me to do so . at the moment of conception i e creation the child has a right to life abortion violates this right thus it is wrong . one because we cannot know that the fetus is not sentient two because saying it is alright to kill those who are not capable of making decisions is the same thing as saying it is okay to kill children the mentally handicapped elderly and sick because they are not capable of making decisions . secondly my opponents defense here is completely and utterly semantic the fact that he pulls attention to my definition and indicates that where it a wider range definition it would be wrong . fourth my opponent claims that since the fetus is not sentient there is nothing wrong with killing it this is a multiple causation fallacy ,0
618,most abortions are performed entirely voluntarily by women that have the means to raise a child but simply do not want to . for example in  only  of women in the us cited health risk as the reason for abortion . most had social reasons i e were not ready did not want a baby a baby would interfere with their career etc ,0
619,would you rather a mother get an abortion by a doctor in an office with all the right equipment or in some old apartment from a shady guy on the street with a pair of tongs . it takes a physical toll on a person to carry a baby inside of them for nine months then give birth to that baby and then give the baby to another family . most people argue that adoption is always better than abortion . if abortion is banned people would not simply change their views on having children . a child is simply an extension of it is mother ,1
621,well i mean what are your other objections to abortion ,1
622,now let us consider the woman that is carrying the fetus ,0
623,because I have never had the opportunity of being a pregnant lady nor do i have the privilege of remembering my fetus days i do not consider myself fit to actually judge as to whether abortion is ok or not . in other words i will be debating that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient while con will do something along the lines that the morality of abortion should be determined by deciding whether a fetus is a person or not . this is not your typical abortion debate ,1
624,your lack of a response does not display that you are committed to this debate ,1
625,to assume that every couple or single woman are incapable of error or other issues avoided with easy access to birth control is to live in a fantasy world where all these unwanted children are adopted and loved . but i must point out that as repulsive as i find it i believe the war and mass euthanasia of animals regularly practiced by this country is necessary . as far as most abortions being harmful to the mother this statement is simply untrue . if a woman does not want a baby there are many contraceptive methods out there . i would assume this is because our society tends to agree with capital punishment euthanasia for terminally I will and war . you are again making a point based on personal belief that is not collectively held by all people hence why the courts have ruled the way they have . there are not enough people to take care of the children in need as it is i can not imagine adding more ,1
626, weeks which is the standard almost globally is well short of that meaning that according to our current science the fetus does not feel pain thus refuting a common argument that of the fetus feeling  my body my choice the fetus is completely dependent upon the mother while in the womb for its nutrition etc . anyhow for those who are too lazy to read it it says in essence that at  weeks pain receptors are widespread and therefore the fetus feels pain possibly at that point . however it goes on to say that the pain receptors are not connected to the brain until   weeks . we give freedom in our society for people to do what they want with their body generally . this means that the fetus can be considered a part of a mothers body ,1
627,first the resolution implies an obligation we must evaluate the resolution based from that standpoint . however it is not unjsut to incarcerate that rapist because it does not violate any human worth . the affirmatives advocacy is not that abortion is a violation of rights rather the advocacy is that killing any type of human without due because is dehumanization . this definition can only apply because justice is based on human worth itself and what is due to a specific person . this is an appropriate evaluative standard because justice is what giving each their due is ,0
628,these studies prove that women who were denied an abortion were clearly not ready to take on the challenge of becoming a mother . if you begin to make it more difficult or impossible for unwed teenage mothers and other women who are not ready to become a mother to receive an abortion the government will be forced to put all of these women on welfare food stamps etc . just to think that all of this psychological damage to the child stress on the mother and excessive government spending could have been easily prevented with an abortion . they will likely become yet another lazy person on welfare sitting on their couch and watching tv . by age  the unwanted children were reluctant to go to school at all and wanted to leave home as soon as possible . one study that was done back in   in sweden compared  unwanted children to  planned children of the same sex as they grew up . they were likely in psychiatric treatment and had a tougher time coping with stress ,1
629,the first round will be for short introductions and acceptance i can not wait to see what you have to say ,0
630,i would like to note that i am only for early term abortions ,1
632,sources for the whole debate common sense induced abortion in the united states  guttmacher institute re thinking abortion psychology gender and the law  mary boyle three essays on the theory of sexuality  sigmund freud the ego and the id  sigmund freud good luck for my opponent . however we are not discussing the moral implications of abortion just the selfish aspect . but you did not so i have to assume you are talking about all the category of middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester . con is saying that it is nonsense to bring a child into the world if they are unloved . so on balance middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester are not selfish . anyway i conceded that the mothers line of reasoning was flawed but to show that is not what we are talking about . i know that if those mothers can give their babies in adoption instead of killing them because they will find someone that adopts them and loves them . i would like to point out this part of cons statement specifically one of the worst thing that could happen to someone is having parents who do not love him . as well as this i always wrote in a polite fashion while pro was insulting and rude breaking the rules of the site . so basically the resolution is that you conclude middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish . this is the definition of selfish that is used in this debate s own personal profit or pleasure . this is a flagrant violation of the rules and should be taken into account by the judges . if a mother is conscious that she will not love that baby that will born nearly it is nonsense to bring him to the world . if a mother is conscious that she will not love that baby that will born nearly it is nonsense to bring him to the world . if a mother is conscious that she will not love that baby that will born nearly it is nonsense to bring him to the world ,1
633,I am not sure pro even read my round  argument and if they did they failed to respond to it ,0
634, merriam webster now as my first point i will start out in saying that i think the biggest issue that and believers have is when life begins . I am sorry that this is not traditional debating style my thoughts tend to get scattered i look forward to your reply and feel free to bring up any points you would like me to comment on . life begins when the sperm and the egg are joined to form a potential child ,0
637,if the mother does not want the child she can always give it up for adoption or give it to someone who can care for the baby but the mother can have easy access to see the baby ,0
639,but that is not what the resolution is about and as such is irrelevant to this debate . to humour you however i respond with this those death numbers are justifiable in that the death is caused by self defence . should you like to debate the morality of abortion i would be more than happy to ,1
640,abortion an operation or other procedure including ingestion of abortifacient pills such as ru  conducted with the primary intention being the death of the zygote embryo or fetus . as per the rules i will make one clarification of position here in the form of a definition of abortion . this concludes the my opening round and i pass the debate back to pro to provide the opening arguments ,0
641,who wants to debate me up in here ,1
642,who ever got an abortion or is for abortion should deserve to get killed the same way they kill the poor inocennt babies i have no regert saying what i just said ,0
643,so you did not provide any new arguments so i have to ask if abortion is murder and an embryo qualifies as a human that would make taking a morning after pill murder then right ,1
645,let us say for instance someone is very spirtualistic and they belive that by having an abortion they send that childs soul to a time where it can be better cared for and live a better life than the one that can be provided or that suffering due to the mother having a very bad disease such as aids can be  eliminated by allowing that childs soul to go somewhere else without having to suffer the pain and the illness or the torture of everyday life for that child . even judaism allows for birth control although they tend to not allow the use of condoms unless someone has an std the primary purpose of sex is to reinforce the loving marital bond between husband and wife .  plus sex is not made for enjoyment or to help with problems i would like to point out many things right here such as how the body is made for sexual plesure notably the female clitorus and breasts and how many people enjoy anal or oral sex far more than vaginal sex regardless of their sex or orientation which clearly shows that yes it is for pleasure every bit as much as a blueberry muffin is . the only exception really is cannabis which is for the most part illegal in the united states while sex is legal for everyone over the age of consent in that state . as for the health aspect it is noted that sex therapy has often been perscibed to people who suffer mental isses such as bi polar or depression as well as stress and for physical injuries as well .  as far as the points about helping the child later in life or how a short life is better than no life i disagree . sex is natural child birth is natural but children are by far not the only reason people have sex nor is it why the vast majority of people have it . while anecondal evidence may give in a factor it must also be presented with facts and statistics such as although i am lactose intolerant and cannot drink milk i understand that for the maority of people it is the way they obtain calcium . it may not be what you or i believe but it may be true and it may be someone elses belief and so long as it is not actually harming anyone what right do we have to tell them they are wrong ,1
646,yes i completely agree that its a gods creation and that god would not want you to destroy a beautiful creation but i mean really if abortion should be banned then all the girls who get raped would have to keep the baby whether they want to or not . relationships nowadays are not like the olden days where they would just hug and kiss on special occasions . now because of our generation so many of us have gone beyond that point ,1
647,if abortion is murder reducto argument if it is the case that abortion in the embryonic stage is equivalent to murder as some anti choicers assert then that means all women who have had an abortion in that period should all be in jail doing sentences for murder maybe even the death penalty as well as any future women who will have an abortion in the embryonic period . they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own . so here is the logical point if rights and freedoms are such that we can not force the billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few millions to save thinking feeling self aware humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily rights and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . like wise it is argued a pregnant women can unplug the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with her pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep them alive such is yours hers bodily rights freedom . all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus for my purposes in this debate the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person . the point is not even the pro life anti choicer believes in such a simplistic absolute right to life and if such a person was to selectively apply such an absolute right to life to justify denying an abortion would be a double standard hypocritical . or  reject such a conclusion based on the realization that abortion is murder in the embryonic stage is false premise to begin with . but as i argue they are not equal the  year old child not only trumps one  day human embryo it even trumps one hundred . i consider this claim to be so obvious that i think anyone who denied it and claimed that a being which satisfied none of   was a person all the same would thereby demonstrate that he had no notion at all of what a person is perhaps because he had confused the concept of a person with that of genetic humanity .  day human embryo is not morally equivalent to a human  year old childconsider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door are   day human embryos behind another a  year old child . pregnant women vs billionaires dis proportionality argument the pro life forced continuation of pregnancy advocates insist their because is just noble as they are out to save lives ,1
648,we are both anti abortion ,0
649,did you know that god had a plan for you before you were born that is being played out right now . anywhoo despite our differences i feel sad that you do not love yourself enough to assert your right to live before birth . do you honestly feel your mother had the right to kill you before you were born ,0
650,you have dismissed my argument regarding rape with only a few comments which i will respond to later . minorities still matter they should not be disregarded and ignored because of this . just because teenagers who get pregnant are a minority it does not mean that they should be ignored . or the reason that their mother cannot live the life she wants to live . do you think that it is okay to ban abortions just because most people who have an abortion are not raped ,1
651,it it is a womens choice if they want to have their baby or not ,1
652,i think so because machines can make a person function when they are clearly dead this creeps out family of the dead if they see it they do it for saving organs etc sometimes and if you start using machines one by one on a person their heart and brainwaives the things that make them clinically alive or not can be usurped by machines and later they are vital signs would be working again . and if all the person is is machines and a beating heart are theyu alive . could there be a point when it is unclear like when machines start taking over a body . and in a way the machine argument goes beyond the idea that the early cells are in questionable form and shows that the mother cuold be like a machine on a lifeless body . and as a society set out to protects human rights it is not only the mother but also the child whose best interests need to be preserved .  chance of life value to mother child society infinite loss it is often the moral thing to do to defer to allowing others the freedom to do something heres it is unclar whether it is hurting another but the principle still is here and needs weighed . it does not seem like a person would die in this regard even though it is a natural phenomenon and not the same as abortion . such that we are only then considering the value of the childs life to the mother but for doing this we have no logical reason as the mother is not the only person involved .  understanding biology cells which fail to be implanted do so because the embryo itself is not sending off the right hormones to prepare the womb for implantation .  i think it is reasonable to think reasonably disputed life can be valued less than the freedom to choose . of coruse the government could decide a point it thinks it is a person cleary but that is not necessarily the early organism cell .  if you think there is any uncertainty about when life begins then it might be reasonable but it is certainly not rational as a complete and rational position has to take into account the risks that ones personal conclusion might be wrong . in terms of energy and plain ol spunk they are more than they ever will be again .  at a certain point it clearly is a human and it is unreasonable to think otheriwse . but i simply disagree and think it is a reasonable position to have ,0
653,i do not understand why christians are so against abortion when the soul of the aborted child widely accepted by the christians goes to heaven . therefore abortion is probably the single best thing any christian can to for their child if the ultimate goal is getting into heaven to be with god . having an abortion instead of delivering the child ensures your childs soul will end up in heaven ,1
654,many more ridiculous things have our taxpayers money been wasted on ,1
655,the resolution is negated and i affirm that a mother should always have the right to an abortion .  argument from defenseshe fails to address the issue at hand a baby is taking nutrients from the mother removal of nutrients and be conceived as harm since this is considered harm the mother has the right to abort the baby under us laws . i have shown this in a majority of waysmy adversary is claiming that by having an abortion in every possible situation you are essentially committing murder but she has failed to distinguish that a fetus is a human life and not just life or the potential of human life . if you are killing the potential of life or something that is not a human life you are not committing murder therefore she fails to address this point . my adversary would have needed to show that the baby is in fact a human and not a life . to defeat this syllogism and initial point she would have to show that taking nutrients is not considered harm . she actually agrees in a sense that the fetus is causing harm which clarifies my stance by saying the mother agrees to the harm ,1
657,he has still failed to produce evidence that abortions lead directly to a situation that deters basic human worth which can lead to the murder of millions of people or his assertion as set out in point  as far as i am aware hitler and stalin were not inspired to their respective genocides because of abortion .  of people believe abortion should be legal within the first three months of pregnancy lastly when specific scenarios are presented to people the favourable view of abortion legality is generally higher than resting beliefs mother is in medical danger  if a chance exists that the child will be mentally disabled  if a chance exists that the child will be born with a life threatening illness  if the pregnancy is a product of rape or incest  if a chance exists that the child will be born with down syndrome  i am reminded by the last statistics above that pro has neglected to feedback on the similar list of obvious reasons to admit abortions that i produced in the opening reproduced below if birth control was practiced but failed if the pregnancy is a product of rape if the pregnancy is a product of an incestuous relationship if the pregnancy is part of an arranged or child marriage if a significant risk exists of passing on a genetically transferable disease if pregnancy is a result of mis or under education if the wom a n was not in a culpable state of mind at the time of conception this includes acute and chronic psychological states of mind affected by neurophysiology or external factors alcohol or drug addicted mothers not included in the original opening is it because to admit one would in fact invalidate my opponent s entire premise repeated here for clarity the abortion of foetuses which do not endanger the mother should be outlawed . even if pro would force child birth as he declares in point  it would appear that nature does not recognise this authority completed weeks of gestation at birth using last menstrual period chance of survival  weeks and less   weeks    weeks   . if however he would seek to be consistent in his views and seek capital punishment then i would accuse him of being far from the moral authority in this argument .   the current spirit of law which seeks to limit abortions to foetal viability is approximately in line with the table above and clearly takes heed of these biological facts in weighing up the rights of the mother to not be forced to child birth agency over her body including dis allowing any type of life in potential to be incubated there against the rights of a life in potential .   i would like the pro to respond honestly if his mother aunt sister girlfriend or wife or even a female acquaintance would choose an abortion would he give her up for the gallows or to ride the lightning . furthermore for someone who would negate the rights of established human life in favour of life in potential and who would claim physical agency over a woman at the point of a gun and retributive justice is hardly apt to accuse anyone or anything of being tyrannical or as treating another as property .    one would think that in possession of the foundational ideas above the pro life conservatives would be the ones arguing for more abortions not less or none . the con has no problem in making this distinction which is why the con is at peace with a woman s right to agency over her own body and uncomfortable with claiming full agency over it before even the point of conception and then to be indefinitely poised to take control of her again should she fail to repress the sexual instinct pro has stated he is against contraception too . he does however assume the right to force a woman to a life of maternal incubation and financial and physical servitude and then absolve himself of all further responsibilities . it is clear that pro does not understand the reason why the constitution is the over ruling and overarching law of the land and that no law state or federally sponsored may be in dissonance with it . the truth is if pro is at all concerned with maternal safety he cannot turn a blind eye to the statistic that more women die in child birth than they do from abortions and still manage the hubris to force a woman to risk her life in such a manner against her will . what the pro finds evil is the execution of the most innocent part of our society for no reason besides the burden they pose ,1
658,physical damage to the mother argument summary it is too early in the debate for me to summarize just yet especially since my opponent has not had an opportunity to respond to my constructive arguments . the bulk of their content is in my attacks on the pro case as it is already and the topic does not give me a burden to provide an alternative but simply to disprove the pro . now for maximum clarity i will frame the round a bit then i will be going pro then con and finishing up with an argument summary frame i simply want to point out here that the burden of proof is on the pro as they are advocating a change to the current state of events . pregnancy is an emotionally and physically stressful time for women and they deserve to know about the procedure before under going it . again pregnancy is a stressful time for women they deserve time to think on such a huge decision i also want to extend my arguments on point  here . meaning they must over overwhelmingly win the clash first off and also win all six points they presented in their constructive . con for now i will just present the tags and expand on them as later ,0
659,why would people go out of their way to create such an important amendment if they know it would start heated debates like this very debate . i would like to start off by saying I have been searching for someone just as fun too debate as you and i could not . last debate i plagorized and i feel awful for it so now I am only going to use links and context to help me in a rebuttal . at this point your probably thinking fetuses are not babies well i would have to rebute you my good sir . i would like to thank my opponent for agreeing to debate me once again . hopefully this will be a good fun debate and may the best man win . if it has nerve cells then why should not it feel pain ,0
660,its not a gerbil and we can recognize that it is human life . development is false also as a  year old woman is more developed than a pre pubescent and yet they are both human environment does not change anything as going  inches down the birth canal does not make you more or less human where you are does not dictate your humanity .   finally this new human being the single cell human zygote is biologically an individual a living organism an individual member of the human species what makes the fetus so obviously biologically human is that from conception the fetus has human dna and the zygote is what every cell you are made from develops . so any pretense that abortion is not killing is a signal of our ambivalence a signal that we cannot say yes it kills a fetus . according to scientific planned parenthood argued as far back as  that everyone already knows that abortion kills .  the official senate report reached this conclusion physicians biologists and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being a being that is alive and is a member of the human species .  the fusion of the sperm with  chromosomes and the oocyte with  chromosomes at fertilization results in a live human being a single cell human zygote with   the number of chromosomes characteristic of an individual member of the human species . killing robs a being of a natural property which is of great if not the greatest value .  on the other side of the pond ann furedi the chief executive of the largest independent abortion provider in the uk said this in a  debate we can accept that the embryo is a living thing in the fact that it has a beating heart that it has its own genetic system within it ,0
661, health i stated in my first argument that women potentially can have huge side effects from abortions . we both agree on the fact that  weeks the fetus is capable of feeling pain i already won in that sense of every abortion at or after  weeks almost  million of them . i already weighed and proved to you the fundamentalist right of life for these babies . look by doing intercourse even with protection measures people should be aware there s still a risk of pregnancy and should be responsible for such . they ve already developed a unique dna and genetic code like to other and will grow to no other . as i talked about previously many women have repeated abortions almost all of them from unprotected intercourse .  right to life con says fetuses don t have protection no rights what so ever ,0
662,abortion is an issue because a whole kids fate is chosen by his mother . there are quite a bit of taxes actually though it may not have been as much as discussed earlier . you post a strong argument but the bills at the end of the month do not lie ,0
663,the one circumstance in which i think abortion is morally justified is in cases where the pregnancy puts the mothers life at risk . second it is justified because if a pregnant woman dies then so does her unborn and it is better to save one life than to lose two . but those do not exhaust the circumstances under which a person might get an abortion therefore they do not show that abortion ,1
664, is it more convenient to give birth even though the life of the mother is in danger and just because abortion is considered immoral .  women have been fighting for equal rights since  . i believe that a women should be allowed to make any decision regarding their body ,1
665,the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse . the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse . the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse ,0
666,i still maintain that such an abortion being murder is more plausibly false and contra con if anyone is a victim here its women who have being told and had to live under laws that presuppose this false premise . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . the zygote is endowed with genes from two parents and thus it is diploid carrying two sets of chromosomes they are human organisms once again demonstrating the point that not all human organisms are of equal moral value . or  reject such a conclusion based on the realization that abortion is murder in the embryonic stage is false premise to begin with . even if science can not prove others have self awareness this does not actually refute the criteria in theory only that it has problems in practice but this is often the case on many things . cons negative utilitarianism the least bad for the most people under cons own moral reasoning there are arguments that can be made in support of allowing early abortion . i maintain that the   personhood criteria is at least superior to cons criteria thus the argument still is the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person and thus does not have a right to life how ever that right is defined . bodily rights argument the violinist analogy recall how con had previously argued that you were not allowed to disconnect from the violinist in the name of saving another life as con had argued .  prevention of suffering of people born into the world with various diseases conditions eg tay sachs edwards syndrome huntingtons alymphocytosis .  mother vs fetus contra con in the later stages of pregnancy some fetuses can live outside the womb . contra con again by having an early abortion such people do not exist in the first place thus such people are not getting killed . so yes indeed cons reasoning does open the flood gates since under their reasoning peoples bodies can be used against their will in the name of saving other lives i showed were that justification gets you con is in denial here . this is especially important considering con has yet to make much of an argument for their own person hood criteria ,1
667,contrary to the opinion of anti abortion activists falsely called as they are against the right to life of the actual human being involved a woman is not a breeding pig owned by the state or church . a fetus does not have a right to be in the womb of any woman but is there by her permission . there is no such thing as the right to live inside the body of another i e there is no right to enslave ,1
668,if they choose to stay in school they get even more support in order to that . i agree that if the pregnancy is dangerous for either mother or child there should be no question as to whether or not she could have an abortion . they get more support if they move out of their parents house and live on their own ,0
669,but my point is you are not taking a childs life away because they never had one to begin with . they were never conscious of their self and by having an abortion it is as if they did not exist . we would not call a seed a tree so we should not consider an embryo a human . i think we can agree that no child should have to be brought up like this living their childhood in an orphanage without ever meeting their real parents . and if they do not kill the baby their alternative is to simply abandon it ,1
670,then there will be  rounds to argue or give rebuttals as you see fit ,1
671,in that case if i find some hobo that no one loves morally i could stab it blow it up anything i want right . if you were raped i think constitutionally you should be given the choice of abortion but i wish gov t would strongly advertise having the baby and giving it to families that are unable to have children . you do not know the limits of humanity and i think the value of a human life is worth so much more than you are making it in your argument ,0
672,i do understand what you are saying but the law can enforce this and make it strong against bad fathers ,0
673,it is barbaric and there is no way that you can change my mind or thousands of others on earth for that matter about that ,0
674,he will forgive you and welcome you into his kingdom i think the pastor is right .  pastor replied god does not believe you did anything wrong . while the question is asked does god approve of abortion the real question is does god approve of women making their own decisions ,1
675,pro is trying figure out in what sense iinnocent so what i mean is a is not responsible for or directly involved in the abortion yet suffers the abortion consequences .  I am not ignoring any contentions i think it is more appropriate for me to clarify before any further rebuttals and i will use my last round to finish any rebuttals and to finish my side of the debate . i talk about things like  day human embryos human organism human fetus embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization etc etc . i m simply saying abortions should be illegal during the embryonic period as well as with the rest of the pregnancy without stating any wording of the law or wording of the penalty or wording of any exceptions to the law . what exact point in a pregnancy event horizon if you will that you think abortion is no longer appropriate ,0
676,but thye destruction of anothers life is immoral and wrongwrong is very vauge ,1
677,the fetus is not a child yet abortion is not killing a child because the child is self reliant in respect to absorbing nutrients necessary for growth and development while the fetus is not . if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy existing because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy and this is true . as long as the fetus is relying on the mother for nutrients to grow and develop for birth the fetus cannot be removed safely from the protection of the mothers body without dying so there is no way for this to happen .  note for voters if you already read and understand my first arguments completely then skip these next paragraphs well the child could not live without the mother it needs all of those nutrients in order to live so removing the fetus would result in its death . if a mothers life can be saved because the fetus is draining her of too many nutrients inducing labor or removing the fetus would also because the fetus to die just as in abortion so you have contradictory points there . if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy would exist because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy . there is no way to safely remove a fetus when it is still growing and developing because if there was and trust me on this no one would ever get an abortion again unless they were raped ,1
678,i do not think abortion should be allowed in america because it is not the mothers life . i understand that it does not have a heart yet or fundamental organs but it is still a living breathing creature that is being murdered because of the mother . the act considers an unborn baby to be a human being and imposes penalties on those who inflict harm on a fetus otherwise than through an abortion ,0
679,i do not think abortion should be legal because no matter if it is unwanted you should give it up for adoption . I am sixteen years old and i believe abortion is bad and unfair to the new life that you are bringing to the world . you killing a baby is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life ,0
680,to transform a fetus into a baby and then send it out into a world where the parents can have no assurance that it will be well loved and cared for is for pro choice people the height of moral irresponsibility ,1
681,i would like to start off by quoting mother teresa by abortion the mother does not learn to love but kills her own child to solve her problems . abortion is defiantly murder of a fetus that has not even had the time to sin or make its own choice in this world . and by abortion that father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world ,0
682,while in as much as  countries abortion is legalized remaining countries have partial restrictions or complete ban on abortion unless life of the mother is at stake . adoption is not an alternative to abortion because it remains the womans choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption . yet the american psychological association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion and that there was no evidence of post abortion syndrome . as it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord its health is dependent on her health and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb .  risk of serious complications and do not affect a womans health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth . in the case of rape or incest forcing a woman made pregnant by this violent act would because further psychological harm to the victim . in the us itself more than  cases of abortion are reported on daily basis . others can t precisely gauge or understand the level of trauma that a woman may be experiencing in her personal life . you would be surprised to know that abortion caused due to rape and other health complications account to nearly  while the remaining cases of abortion are primarily a result of personal and social issues . in fact abortion has always been a heated subject amongst the masses as people have their own school of thoughts regarding it . abortion pros sometimes life can be really harsh on us . statistics show that very few women who give birth choose to give up their babies less than  of white unmarried women and less than  of black unmarried women . she is the only person who knows best if she would be able to take care of the unplanned child or not ,1
683,based on this alone pro has failed to meet his burden and a con vote is warranted . it merely assumes such an abortion effect exists when it is clear it does not . my opponents reason for the hypothetical is this  evidence is flawed  it is simpler .  the increased pre marital births increases the amount of unwanted and abused children leading to more crimes and at best no effect . and that the actual data shows abortions many societal effects fit example increased out of wedlock births increases the crime rate murder rises  and most areas of crime remain non effected . to be clear here are some abortion effects increase in pre marital sex sharp rises in out of wedlock births drop of number for adoption decline in marriages amongst previously pregnant woman the hypothesis is abortion lowers unwanted children . although more of them get aborted pre marital sex is more common as the risk of pregnancy is perceived as lower ,0
684,it is not fair as i have had greater education experience than you and have lived through social issues that you have not experienced yet ,1
685,so take a side with me and say no to abortion ,0
686,i am sure my opponent and i can agree on the term abortion as given below . abortion a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy and because the death of the fetus . so botched abortion is a fallacy as it does not mean the baby was born during the abortion ,0
687,as this is a morally abhorrent and absurd conclusion the initial premise that we can justify killing in order to improve the genepool must be false . abortion whether therapeutic or illegal is in the main no longer dangerous because it is being done well by physicians  finally it is not as if women are forced to have abortions if they do then the problem to be solved is the fact that they are being coerced the vast majority are seeking an abortion out of their own free choice . if abortion is justified in order to improve the human genepool the justifications are not logically limited to the unborn . whether someone is conscious at present does not affect whether they will go on to live a future life which is the reason why killing is wrong in the first place explained in round  . yet even if we do know for certain that the childs life will be made miserable because of its parentage which we definitely do not the proposition that we are justified in killing rape children to prevent them from suffering has absurd conclusions namely that we would be morally and legally obliged to kill anyone if we perceived that their life would contain suffering . the latter is an actual human being that will go on to live a future life the former has the potential to form a human being and as such will not go on to live a future life the sperm ceases to exist at fertilisation . hence the killing of a foetus is not permissible whereas the killing of a sperm is permissible as the latter is not being denied the opportunity to live a future human life . even if a woman is raped there is no reason why this should render the killing of a foetus as morally permissible . a sperm is fundamentally different to a foetus in such a way that killing the former is permissible whereas killing the latter is not . nobody denies that having to carry the child of your rapist will be probably be mentally unsettling but in order for this to be shown to be a justification for abortion it must be demonstrated that this is a less preferable event than the killing of the foetus . a sperm does not have a potential future human life all it has the potential to do is fertilise an egg nothing more . therefore the argument fails because  millions more die if abortion is legal and  banning abortion would not have a significant effect on womens health .   furthermore the legality of abortion has no immediate affect on their safety as the medical director of planned parenthood wrote ninety percent of illegal abortions are being done by physicians . moreover the fact that the majority of rape children are living ordinary lives and are not suicidal is testament to the fact that they prefer the chance to live their life as opposed to being killed in order to spare them potential suffering . if someone is killed then they have their whole future life eliminated whereas undergoing nine months of unwanted pregnancy is a temporary period of physical discomfort ,0
688, russian children killed by adoptors is certainly a tragedy but it pales in comparison to the  babies killed by abortionists each day just in the us alone according to concernedwomen org which also states abortion increases breast cancer risks other health risks and leads to serious emotional consequences . do we step on adult spiders and cut down mature trees . also  women have died as a result of legal abortion ,0
689,to put it simply having an abortion will not change the fact she was raped . also your concluding argument has nothing to do the debate which was thus commenting on it would be pointless for both sides . the women has an option to put the child up for adoption or foster care to avoid that problem or the women is strong enough to get over such a gruesome attack ,0
690,well the debate has ended with no effort to argue in favour of abortion by pro ,0
691,first of all when con says but provides no source defining how he was led to this conclusion nor does he back up this statement therefore it is a baseless opinion statement irrelevant as no evidence has been presented by my opposition that i can really accept as valid as there is not much i can rebutt from that statement which proves that its not really a valid argument . con also states another one of his beliefs but does not provide any reasoning as to how this statement has anything to do with this argument over whether abortion should be legal or not . not once are we told that a fetus which is used to define the baby in the state where they have the abortion is defined as a child and of course we can not kill children ,1
692,thank you for posting i look forward to it ,1
693,to start abortion are good for young women in there teen years who are dirty birdies and are not using birth control or condoms ,1
694,so to choose to terminate the life a possibly viable human is wrong indeed . therefore if the mother is conscious during the first  weeks she should be well aware of her condition and should have by this point accepted her destiny to become a mother otherwise she would have abort the child in the earlier stages . the baby should be delivered via c section and given the medical care needed to offer the best chance for survival the quality of medical care will always very based on the current conditions and my in fact may include no care if none is available ,0
696,either the state takes the draconian measure of restricting freedom of movement or it must admit that its law is unworkable in practice and abolish it ,1
697,the pro has clarified how people who are suspected of being future tyrannical leaders would be examined on an annual basis which may give his argument more believable but what if a subject is examined multiple times and only once is considered for retrospective abortion . as for the con attacking my position over the death penalty to nullify my argument there is a very outstanding difference between retrospective abortion and the death penalty death penalty the subject has already committed a terrible crime been found guilty of committing it and the state he was prosecuted in has decided to sentence him to death . they are being killed because of fear they will commit a crime based on their early childhood behavior and nothing else ,0
698,if the mother is under  and raped we should not allow the baby to die for it . if the baby is healthy there is no reason the baby would have to die in this situation . do you mean the forced birth of the baby ,0
699, whistles aimlessly still no argument from con ,0
700,full resolution the usfg should ban abortion except in cases where the mothers life is in danger ,0
701,the very fact that there is a age restriction is why people abort ilegally ,1
702,he does not get to simply spam random words and then expect my to piece together his argument like a jigsaw . i have written more than he has about this on this debate . his argument is just singular words with no context ,0
703,it cannot even feed itself or breathe it can only leach oxygen and nutrients out of its mothers bloodstream making it more of a parasite than a person and not on its own like a person which must be independent not connected with another separate colour oxford english dictionary if an embryo or a fetus has never been alive how can it be killed . also at the point where many mothers use abortion pills to abort a few days after conception there is only a  chance that the baby will even attach itself to the uterus and even after that a  chance of miscarriage if the mother is below  or so . as neither of these categories apply to a fetus one could safely venture that killing a fetus is not killing a person as a fetus is indeed not a person . so you like many other faceless millions are saying that abortion is and that is why it is wrong . well if murder is one person killing another person and a fetus or an embryo is not a person then the police are not allowing murder ,1
704,also pro s objection does not work because i have already defined scenario  to have more happiness than scenario  so simply stating that scenario  would lead to less happiness is outright false .  rule utilitarianism upholds them because it recognises that a society will generally be happier if we establish certain rights if rule utilitarian compromises on happiness because establishing rights increases it then none of pro s arguments for maximising utility in the case of abortion are sound . pro has made no other rebuttals to liberty as a value and also pro drops my human development index defence of liberty thus on framework alone pro has already lost this debate since he has not successfully rebutted my value and his value has at worst been heavily mitigated it not outright refuted . because pro must first assume the conclusion before justifying the premise his position explicitly begs the question and hence is unsound since stability of government is exactly what we are trying to affirm here it is the conclusion we are trying to achieve . according to pro s logic then it would be acceptable to just snip the umbilical cord or wherever else is necessary perhaps even remove the entire uterus itself which is clearly part of the mother and wait for the foetus to die on its own accord such as is performed in some hyserosomy abortions . because pro s entire defence of value is predicated on a strawman then his objections to liberty and rights are also a strawman . frameworklibertyi did not advocate for the harm principle nor did i even cite it hence large swaths of pro s rebuttal to my positive case is a blatant strawman .  the only reason why indirect death is preferable is due to diffusion of responsibility perhaps the patient could have obtained an organ donation elsewhere etc .  in short they take responsibility for their own welfare so it is no longer the governments concern if we are assuming utility as a value then pro cannot make this defence without undermining his own case . thus while  of pro s dichotomy is correct liberty ought only be impeded if it impedes on the liberty of others these parameters do not apply in the same way to bodily autonomy . pro is running with the assumption that laws are there to maximise happiness but does not make any attempt to prove this or rebut my liberty value which contradicts it . also this assumes an extremely wealthy environment which is not the case for an extremely large minority of the world see the following chart pro also drops that it causes other complications including reduced quality of life mental health issues etc . just where is pro s argument that the right and freedom to abortion does not increase total happiness via . absolute selective bodily autonomywe have already established that bodily autonomy ought to be upheld for a stable society even if it restricts the rights or harms other people such as is the case with the organ transplant scenario . also pro is conflating a consequence of a stable society increased utility from the norm with the requisite of a stable society . also pro s defence here presupposes that the foetus is a being who has rights to begin with question begging organ donationgiven that pro accepts the premise that someone ought to have the right and liberty to withhold use of their organs even if it maximises utility then pro s defence here is already dubious . virtually all of pro s case can be dismissed on these grounds ,1
705, one is either for human life as a right or thinks human life is a privilege granted by law or society since pro life refers to abortion this stance is based on protecting the life of the innocent not the guilty which capital punishment addresses . pro seems to be the one trying to change that . no that is why we have dictionaries to ensure that we are all speaking the same language ,0
706,pro con pro because the burden is on the affirmative ,1
707,one being that there is no constitutional legal or scientific basis for the fetus to obtain the unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness . this is also an incorrect use of the  amendment as the original intent was to abolish slavery as a practice as established in butler vs . however under this same logic one could also question the legitimacy of the right to privacy for the mother in question too . if con agrees to waive his her fourth round i ask the voters to not penalize danielle for not initially following the structure of the debate . debate structure here is what has happened in this debate both pro and con presented their cases both pro and con refuted each others cases both pro and con offered counter rebuttals as of the posting of this argument as of now the debate is balanced in terms of who did what .  meanwhile con has not disputed the legal authority of the declaration of independence or the authority of the undhr . in cases of rape a person who is unable to give consent who had sex with a partner would be defined as rape ,0
708,if abortion is murder reducto argument if it is the case that abortion in the embryonic stage is equivalent to murder as some anti choicers assert then that means all women who have had an abortion in that period should all be in jail doing sentences for murder maybe even the death penalty as well as any future women who will have an abortion in the embryonic period . they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own . so here is the logical point if rights and freedoms are such that we can not force the billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few millions to save thinking feeling self aware humans then it would be laughable to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily rights and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . like wise it is argued a pregnant women can unplugged the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with her pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep them alive such is yours hers bodily rights . all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus for my purposes in this debate the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person . or  reject such a conclusion based on the realization that abortion is murder in the embryonic stage is false premise to begin with . the point is not even the pro life anti choicer believes in such a simplistic absolute right to life and to selectively apply it in the case of women abortion is a double standard and hypocritical . i consider this claim to be so obvious that i think anyone who denied it and claimed that a being which satisfied none of   was a person all the same would thereby demonstrate that he had no notion at all of what a person is perhaps because he had confused the concept of a person with that of genetic humanity . but as i argue they are not equal the  year old child not only trumps one  day human embryo it even trumps one hundred .  day human embryo is not morally equivalent to a human  year old childconsider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door are   day human embryos behind another a  year old child . think about it the likes of charles manson ted bundy and next to them endless row cells of women who had an abortion in the embryonic stage ,1
709,here is some data on why women get abortions percentage of women reporting that specified reasons contributed to their decision to have an abortion reason  n   having a baby would dramatically change my life  would interfere with education  would interfere with job employment career  have other children or dependents  can not afford a baby now  unmarried  student or planning to study  can not afford a baby and child care  can not afford the basic needs of life  unemployed  can not leave job to take care of a baby  would have to find a new place to live  do not want to be a single mother or having relationship problems  not enough support from husband or partner  husband or partner is unemployed  husband or partner is abusive to me or my children  have completed my childbearing  not ready for a nother child  do not want people to know i had sex or got pregnant  do not feel mature enough to raise a nother child  husband or partner wants me to have an abortion  possible problems affecting the health of the fetus  physical problem with my health  parents want me to have an abortion  was a victim of rape  became pregnant as a result of incest  . until then i argue that since fetuses can not feel pain nor are the conscious abortion is a way to prevent pain in the lives of mothers and children . this is the definition of a man woman or child of the species homo sapiens distinguished from other animals by superior mental development power of articulate speech and upright stance . and even if some of these women can the baby is likely going to be neglected as the women who would keep it are likely to be innmature and will not have time to properly care for their child . thesis abortion the lawful termination of a fetus is moral and should be legal in certain scenarios and times . the stereotypical hormonal stress response of adults or older infants of about  months onwards reporting pain is observable in fetuses at  weeks gestation . so our options are either to have millions of babies born into poor or irresponsible homes or we can have the pregnancy terminated early so that no harm is caused to either the mom or the fetus . fetuses can not think or feel pain in fact their brains hardly exist at all . as discussed neuroanatomical pathways necessary for processing pain similar to those observed in adults and older children could be in place by  weeks gestation . for example  of women or around   women yearly based on the fact that there are around  thousand abortions yearly get abortions because their partner is abusive . these and other observations are taken to suggest that the fetal mind can support an experience of pain from at least  weeks gestation ,1
710,for that reason if we see that politics and law are not working to stop the two year old killer we should engage in defense of others and shoot the man killing the children . how is it not her fault that she did not abort earlier when morally grayer even the law recognizes no absolute right and how not her fault that she is at least partially responsible for the childs existance etc . he did not comply with rules that determine how to determine viability etc ,0
711,i am strongly against abortion simply because man does not give life and therfore should not take life especially a life that innocent ,0
712,if your not even going to give the child a chance to live you can pre judge what his her life will be like .  first we have a mother who is dying of cancer and the only way to save her is to kill the child . he she is still a living being and has potential to life and denying them the privilige of life would be cruel just because they have an extra chromosome . so are you saying that all mentally hadicapped people on the earth do not have a right to live . first of all she has cancer and there is the likliness of her dying anyway ,0
713,in many cases womens lives are lost through abortion . a child did not decide that his parents would have unprotected sex . an unborn child is always innocent and should never be punished ,0
714,i would add to these reasons of course bodily autonomy women and girls own themselves and it would be categorically wrong to impose upon them the onus of not being able to control their own bodies or to impose a moral view on them when in reality morality is far more complex . in the process he provides several unique reasons as to why people should be allowed to have abortions a people make stupid decisions b they may not be able to take care of it c not allowing it may breed resentment amongst parents toward their children and d it may ruin a young girls life . con writes i think so most people make stupid decisions in their life especially in high school where they can not think about the future and if they do have children can they take care of it ,1
715,sorry if you took that comment the wrong way but i do believe studies are quite important in this context . i will admit in my previous response i deconstructed this poorly considering i as under heavy time constraints but now i can talk about this in more detail . next you talk about how i fair to support my claim to why i believe the childs life should not end because of the parents . considering i talked about your link to why a human and a person are not the same already i will supply an alternative definition . you dedicated the first paragraph too talking about the cost of raising a child and about the costs presented . so basically what i am trying to argue is that all human life is equal therefore a human should not have the choice too murder another human for their personal benefit . i have already established the fact in my previous response that proves the child is in fact human and since this was not addressed in this response i assume we can agree on that . i think morality is absolutely the overriding factor in this debate because it plays with life itself . you argue that this is because this debate is not completely based on morality where i would argue that it is ,0
716,you answer   dollars for this month i gave you this moneym and then you had a chance to survive and now you are alive but second month comes and you still need money you come to me and ask artur you are a rich man without your help i have no chance to survive please give me   which supplies all the money i need for the treatment of this month if you do not provide me with the money i need then i can not survive .  you have a right to leave baby has a right to live on but the woman has also right not to destroy her life so that the baby can live on as i stated on the first round . she does not say that kill my baby if you can make the baby living in a diffrent way but she can not be required to provide for others life how come can you think that she has to destroy her own life for that baby . i provide you with money so that you can survive and woman provides baby with the things that the baby needs in order to survive can you have a right to force me to give you money . and abortion does not mean if you want and can let the baby live the woman will not say my baby has to die she just does not want to carry her .  as americans we have established that the right to life is an unalienable right and is to never be taken away unless the rights of the individual is taken away due to actions they have committed against the society .  you may have a moral rules laws and maybe abortion is out of moral but you can not require or force somebody to live according to the rules set by society if it contradicts the liberty of person you have no choice ,1
717,i guess the question becomes is a fetus aware ,1
718,that will most likely end her education and because her to work at mc . i think so most people make stupid decisions in their life especially in high school where they can not think about the future and if they do have children can they take care of it . i think not and most parents will be angry with their children ,0
719,give me  reason why we should keep it ,0
720,this is not an argument it is not even properly written ,0
721, if you want to have a baby by all means proceed . you seem to be pretty much admitting that if you do not want to risk pregnancy you can not do it . almost no one goes to this degree but they could which shows some degree of culpability ,0
722,i believe abortion at anytime in a pregnancy is wrong and should be illegal ,0
723,if i am old enough to engage in sexual activity why should i not decide whether or not to abort ,1
724, and besides i already have a link proving that up to the third trimester a foes cannot feel pain . firstly i never advocated supporting any of the above groups and they are nto relevant to this debate so strawman . secondly it does not matter where the word foetus comes from today it means the precursor to a baby in the womb during pregnancy . instead of saying not to have sex because you are a minor they give out condemns and birth control . i thank my opponent for his response con the baby inside the mothers womb is a genetically different human being than the mother so the question is how is killing a baby inside the womb or one minute out of the womb any different . furthermore the brain does not begin to develop  weeks into pregnancy a neural groove future spinal cord forms over the notochord with a brain bulge at one end .  con sex under the age of  is statutory rape so the rapist is the guilty one . lastly the word fetus comes from latin roots meaning a child up to the age of eighteen . first of all you can always deliver the baby after  weeks giving the mother and the baby a chance to live .  pro firstly i put forward a scenario where delivering a baby would mean death for to the child and mother . the new protocol for partial birth abortions is giving a spinal epidural so that the baby will not feel the pain and move ,1
725,I am not saying that parents can deny an abortion if a doctor requests it I am just saying that parents should be involved in the process ,0
726,i hate forefeits urghh ,1
727,if we universalise that killing is right then we are more likely to develop into more virtuous people and create a better society you wound not think someone who kills your dog is as capable as you as being a moral member of society . as you have never agreed to the contract either tacitly or otherwise you have no rights and the explorers can kill you without being unjustified doing so . however what about if you were born on a dessert island and some american explorers came to the island . i think the social contract works best if we adopt a utilitarian law making system which encompasses all human life no matter its stage of development . i think it likely you would agree that freedom to kill another human say if you had a three year old child that depends on you to sustain its existence ,0
728,i that we should strive to bring up wholesome children but they cannot be wholesome if they can not exist . i have been very busy and have not had time to post much i will refute your arguments in the order you created them . you stated that a mother would request an abortion because she cannot just using one example have the baby inside her body please tell me how one would not be able to maintain a child in her womb ,0
729,in the case that the procedure kills the child in itself and unnecessarily as in partial birth abortion then it should be prohibited and certainly does violate the rights of the child . if the pilot does not would not the property owner be justified in physically removing him from the property by force . abortion is not necessarily an act of killing any more than the example with the apartment owner . take the following example of this let us assume that there is a property which exists on the top of a high plateau with cliffs which drop hundreds of feet to a valley surrounding it . but in any case the mother is just as much as the apartment owner ,1
730,i will now rebut my opponents rebuttals for lack of arguments just rebuttals rebuttal to my opponents rebuttal  constitutionality ok first of all i was wrong about the constitution thing though i do believe that part of the declaration of independence was the principals on which are nation was founded on ipso facto they are also in the constitution and the articles of confederation no longer in use . finally my opponent offers only a citation of my reason rebutted  to rebut reason rebutted  that is counterproductive to his winning the debate . argument  round two partial rebuttal to my opponents rebuttal  my opponent argues that a fetus is alive when it needs to develop to fill the biological requirements . rebuttal to my opponents rebuttal  poor quality of life so punishing them for a life mistake that could in turn ruin their lives . rebuttal to my opponents rebuttal  murder there was no rebuttal here just pointing that out rebuttal to my opponents rebuttal  biblical because true it may say what my opponent says but the majority of abortions are from accidental pre marital sex pregnancies pre marital sex is unforgivable in the bible contradiction much . a fetus can only feel pain after  weeks most abortions occur in the first  months  weeks . rebuttal to my opponents rebuttal  protect the innocent i agree that is a different argument rebuttal to my opponents rebuttal  biological life depends on your opinion duh but fetuses as fetuses are biologically not alive . argument  round two the world is getting close to overpopulation at least in respect to the water supply while abortion would help it would not help significantly every bit counts . our nation is religiously free and our policy should reflect as such amendments  and  ,1
731,whatever it is it is up to the mother if she wants to do it and no one can say otherwise ,0
732,i also reject his source pro life is two words and no definition may contain the term being defined in same . ergo discounting the ad populem as fallacious and my opponents inability to find as a mere statement of his work . those who support abortion because a fetus is not human take a position not connected to pro life ,1
733,i feel it is intellectually dishonest when people argue against the death penalty but are in favor of late term abortions ,0
734,because the woman has caused the fetus to need the use of her body and because pregnancy is an ordinary way we provide care to fetal persons unlike general organ donation then she is obligated to provide that care . after all if i presented an argument in defense of concentration camp victims right to life to an ss officer while imprisoned at auschwitz my argument would still be correct even though i have no real freedom to present it or have it rationally considered . we may not violate the property rights of other people if we hold discourse to be a rational means of normative inquiry . but i provided compelling evidence that a fetus is a person and therefore this person would have property rights over his own body that an abortionist may compromise . i believe con s argument fails to justify abortion rights because it requires us to assume the truth of premises that are even more controversial than the conclusion of the argument . bu this clearly seems to be false and i can provide several examples to show that property rights are routinely curtailed in the interest of more compelling rights . moral patients like animals fetuses infants the handicapped ecosystems or even future generations may not be able to act morally themselves but their nature may still require us to act morally towards them even if no contractual arrangement is arranged between either party . the existence of such a right would automatically violate the negative right of self ownership of someone else through binding him to act in a certain way and would therefore be unacceptable . when conducting an argument the parties only assume that laws of logic such as a a or a statement cannot be true and false at the same time in the same sense are true . point  freedom and arguments while premise one is obviously true it is not true that an argument itself depends on the freedom of the arguers premise two . if you believe that this baby has a positive right to be cared for because they were created by a moral agent then i cannot see how a fetus is not entitled to similar care .  i own my speech intellectual property and the body that utters it but the you s supreme court ruled in  that even a basic freedom like speech can be curtailed in the interest of public safety . these rights can never be violated if rational discourse is to be maintained ,0
735,a baby is a gift from god that does not decide when to enter a persons life ,0
736,i think abortion can help certian people out as many women in ledcs need to get an abortion to preserve their quality of life ,0
737,first round for opening position statement and acceptancesecond round for opinion and pointsthird round for rebuttali believe that the practive of abortion is murder and should be banned by the government ,0
738,if no health risk is presented by remaining pregnant and the pregnant woman is not heavily affected by tocophobia then giving the child to family you know that can afford it raise it want it and can be there for it is the better choice but not everybody knows someone like that . i know several more that constnatly work to provide for their family because of the bad socio economic situation and i even know someone whose mother sold her  year old sister as a prostiute to help provide for the family . abortion in either case would have been much more beneficial but now those six children need paid for and it will only be a vicious cycle especially since the mother got her daughters back after only  years of them being taken . i am aware of such things however sometimes it is not feasible and nor is it always the best choice . now it seems like my opponent is forgetting several points that i have made in my first round which i will point out later in this round first i will refute cons arguments . a child is not a disease it lives it breathes it has a heartbeat actually for the first three weeks of pregnancy there is no heartbeat they do not breathe until their face hits air which is how water birthing works it will not breathe until the face hits air and for the first several weeks it is no better than any other std . with all that said my personal experiences should not matter in coming up with a logical view based facts rather than personal history . he has nowhere to go really and in a town that size there are not a lot of options . keep in mind i said abortion can sometimes be the right choice not that is all of the time . my aunt has had  misscaraiges and each one sent her into a state of pure depression . and while we are talking about health what about a woman who becomes pregnant and during her pregnancy finds out she has aids and so her unborn child does too ,1
739,which is decided as many different times by different people as i am not sure on your opinion on the start of a life then i cannot yet inform you whether you are wrong or not on that yet but I am pretty sure your view will humour me ,1
740,at least then it would be loved and cared for not murdered ,0
741,i am against abortion because if a man is drunk and he drove and ran a stop light and hit a pregnant woman he would get charged for two murders but if a woman gets pregnant and chooses to not have that child she does not get charged with a murder and it is her fault if she gets pregnant but there is a flaw here is she gets raped then she could have the child but put it in a orphanage rather than not letting the kid have a chance to cure cancer or aids or other diseases like that . murder the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another . pregnant having a child or young developing in the uterus ,0
742,want to debate me on this ,1
743,a fertalized egg is not a person it is a sex cell and has no autonimy of it is own instead it is property of the mother just like my sperm is my own property ,1
744,even if we accpet your premise that the mother has an absolute right to evict them . you like almost everyone who takes ths debate is arguing against soemthing i do not even say . I am just arging they should be safely removed if healthy . healthy viable babies who can live outside the mother should not be aborted just removed . the police do not come and shoot trespassers on your property they come and tak them away ,0
745,simply saying over and over that personal belief that abortion is immoral justification of murdering someone is not a full enough substantiation especially since pro fails to properly show that any reasonable number of people agree with him outside of trying to say that their beliefs support him even though they themselves claim their beliefs to not . while it is true that most people are still in favour of death penalty the fact that a substantial percentage of people are against it throws doubt into the morality of killing anyone as a punishment . preface i will start this round by pointing out that pro has completely ignored every case I have made outside of my remarks about his sources . we cannot fall into the belief that simply because we think something is wrong that we can murder others for it . pro tries to insinuate that the  whom consider it taking a human life are to be include in those who consider it murder . the problem here is that books are not acceptable sources unless he presents a specific part of the book as you can not expect the voters to honestly read through two books to get the meaning . if they are against the death penalty why would they support murdering an abortionist especially without a trial . the half who do not consider abortion murder must be explained as wrong . lastly on this note I will remind pro that we cannot perform executive actions as we are not legally permitted enforcers such as police . if the courts do not provide sentencing then no punishment can be provided and any act of punishment would be a crime in and of itself and allowing such a crime would be a horrifying precedence that should not be allowed . therefore it is not an appropriate action for someone to act out as they perceive it without a trial ,1
746,I have done that ,1
747,what god requires of a woman is she obey the laws of caesar the laws which her community society and culture have made for her and she must abide by her conscience and what her relationship with the divine demands of her ,1
748,it fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life metabolism growth reaction to stimuli and reproduction finally is the human zygote merely a new kind of cell or is it a human organism that is a human being . the zygote is composed of human dna and other human molecules so its nature is undeniably human and not some other species . this dna includes a complete guiding not only early development but even hereditary attributes that will appear in childhood and adulthood from hair and eye color to personality traits .  is the name of the first cell formed at conception the earliest developmental stage of the human embryo followed by the and stages . at the moment when a human sperm penetrates a human ovum or egg generally in the upper portion of the fallopian tube a new entity comes into existence ,0
749,with these two points clarified i think it is justified to say that even though i am pro the burden of proof is on my opponent to prove that  the federal government provides significant funding of non medical non abuse abortions through tax payer dollars and  the amount of federal dollars used to fund non medical non abuse abortions is not justified . availability of these options vary from year to year but for the sake of semantics the hyde amendment bans federal funding of non medical abortions non rape incest abortions . the hyde amendment which is voted on every year currently allows for federal funding of abortions in cases of rape incest or if the mothers life is endangered by the pregnancy ,1
750,i do not really think i have anything to argue against yet ,1
751,in the argument that my opponent posted it lists a number of huge sums about how many people die each year from abortion and continues to provide a false baseless sum that says that every second more people die from abortion then from all the people who died in   but the fact is that this is a planet of around six billion people and that is a very small amount and plus the argument provides no sources or evidence so it is clearly invalid . to start i would like to rebutt the points in the article . multiply  by  and every minute  poor african children die ,1
752,why punish the baby for the mistakes of another ,0
753,should there be an amendment to ban abortion in my opinion yes there should ,0
754,the father does not have a say in abortion because abortion is about the womans right to choose not the mans right to property . we have already agreed that a fetus is not yet a child or person and therefore has no right to anything . requiring a woman to take unnecessary risks with her life and body and pregnancy always greatly increases medical risks just because the man who ejaculated into her says that she must is indicative of slavery and a blatant infringement upon her rights . pro is suggesting that a man can force biological impositions onto a woman just because they have had sex . I am glad to see that my opponent concedes to the fact that a person and not a fetus has rights ,1
755, yes or no conclusion abortion is favored conclusion is elaborated on to reduce the amount of suffering and needless death of those brought into the world only to suffer and die should constitute a good thing for it adds to the well being of the people capable of continuing existence . also included are the lack of professional support with access to accurate and up to date information about all the things involved in abortion i e history modern understanding of the process physiological analysis physical exams before and after the procedure . those rights include first this persons right to control their bodily functions in such a way that they can be considered to have aspirations to full participation equal membership and active involvement in society . to start my argument i would like to invoke what i will argue are important factors in deciding whether abortion is acceptable on the terms i agreed to above . thus we can conclude that it is always in our best interest to keep open options for the populations control in order to balance our sustainability . if no safe access to abortion is available the means to accomplish the abortion are dangerous and lead to unsafe choices . i would like to add the form of payment as it will be under the table and lacking any records of responsibility . a population can only sustain a certain amount of people based on the groups ability to also sustain to food water resources and space for the individuals to live . i will not assert or continue any debate about what one personally should feel about the act of abortion in and of itself . here an argument is made that the results of not acting to provide safe access to abortion only increases the harm done . conclusion abortion is favored conclusion is elaborated on it can be further demonstrated by historical standards of human relations that because of the person who bares the child they without abortion options are forced to be dependent on others for well being with but few exceptions . by the words of charlotte perkins gilman not only these but home and happiness reputation ease and pleasure her bread and butter all must come to her through a small gold ring . even worse is when abortion is railed against by those whom proclaim they are fighting for a possible life they themselves are not willing to take care of and will soon as possible turn a blind eye to the forthcoming real suffering of lives effected by ,1
756,i will be arguing against the resolution abortion is wrong ,1
757,but what wrong has a speechless baby done that it deserves execution similar to that of criminals here in the world outside of the womb . i would have to argue that all countries in the world have certain laws that defend an individual who takes a life through self defense or execution or war etc . we live in a world where there are state of the art technologies and medical facilities for just such situations and studies have shown that when given proper support most women who are pregnant because rape gradually change their attitudes about their unborn child from something repulsive such as abortion to someone who is innocent and uniquely worthwhile . but the life of a human is the product of the combination of human dna so whether it is developed facial features or not the second the sperm comes into contact with the egg that combination makes it human . since when do we kill those whose only was being brought into existence based on the choice of his or her parents . however since i do not know your religious affiliation i will leave religion out of this debate to avoid any comments that may be perceived as disrespectful . so to have an abortion would mean that the baby feels the cold steel knife cutting it up but has no voice to defend itself against such cruelty . if you have concluded that it is not the right time to have children then what is the point of even having intercourse in the first place . the argument of being assumes the stance that the unborn is not fully human however science clearly proves the contrary . the answer is simple it depends on the choice of those in power who carry the knife who redefine the meaning of life and those who decide which individual is worthy of life and who is not . there is no logic in executing someone that has broken no law and such actions are therefore deemed as murder ,0
758,are you willing to look a child of a rapist in the eyes everyday for the next  years of your life ,1
759,i will await your opening argument and am excited for this debate ,1
760,but we recognize the moral ambiguities and other considerations i gave in my first post and make the laws have no legal consequence . so as a matter of deference to not wanting to kill people we should ban abortion . I am not sure why con says i have not provided argumentation ,0
761,the swing states will be vital ,1
762,for one the child is by this point devoloped and fully a human life so why should we be allowed to kill an unborn baby but not another adult human being ,0
763,definitions explanations early abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy . the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age . medical non surgical abortions using medications such as mifepristone  are available in some clinics ,1
764,the us constitution prescribes a system of separation of powers and checks and balances for the smooth functioning of all the three branches of the federal government . the removal of an embryo or fetusfrom the uterus in order to end a pregnancy . i would like to thank harrytruman for accepting this debate . a violation of any of the above rules shall result in an automatic forfeiture of the person who violated the rules . the federal government has three branches i the legislature which is the us congress ii executive comprised of the president and vice president of the us and iii judiciary ,1
765,a sperm requires a specific set of circumstances to become a living human but then so does a foetus it has to remain inside a uterus and to be provided with nutrients and a bunch of other conditions . i think a case could be made in many cases after  weeks too but i see no need to pursue such a case as the wording of the motion is that we should ban all abortions I am happy to concede after  weeks . the foetus is no more capable of developing into a living human vy itself than the sperm is both require a female body to turn them into a living human . however the motion still fails as before  weeks the foetus is not capable of suffering in any meaningful way how can you justify giving something which is not conscious and is unable to suffer in any way that even superecede the rights of a live conscious woman . the crux of the argument so far seems to come down to this we agree that before  weeks a foetus is not capable of suffering in any meaningful way and is not conscious ,1
766,abortion is always wrong because it takes a life a life that no one has the right to take . adoption allows the mother to not have to raise a child and she would not have to carry the guilt of killing a baby for the rest of her life . pro believes the choice to carry the baby for  months is better than killing a innocent life which is evil and irresponsible . so con says that it is right to kill someone if they interfere with your life . the mother can always give the baby up for adoption after birth ,0
767,killing a devil is not murder ,1
768, percent of abortions are after  weeks so in the part of senstivity i will be using this  week thing not the  week thing according to the definitons as a really rare number only  . the fetus does not match all of them so the fetus does not have the right of life so we can kill it because it is not a living thing hence does not have any right or liberty so we should make abortion legal according to my framework . the resolution is negated and abortion should be legal because the fetus has no right and is not murder if we kill it . the  of your life is when you go to college and earn lots of money but these people need to care for the babies . the fetus does not have the right of life so we should ban abortion by saying that abortion is murder because it is not according to my arguments and my sourced evidence so as abortion is not murder and harms the mother who has rights abortion should not be illegal or should be legal . so there are no reasons why we should have an illegal abortion because women do produce abortions anyways and they are more dangerous so we should just have abortion legalized . the mother has the liberty to do what her body and she does not need to care for a fetus that is not even living . sensitivity the fetus can sense at  weeks in his earliest but as in average  weeks which is over a month before most abortions occur . the women are not doctors so they can not produce safe abortions and they are illegal abortions . there are  categories a living thing must have in order to be called living and if it does not even match one of the case it is not considered living . many mothers every year die because of not having an abortion because a baby costs money and gives you stress and the mothers do not bear the stress and in the end die because of these fetus who are not even living . argument  the right of lifethis will be my shortest argument because it is mostly explained in my previous argument but i will explain it a bit more . as in the framework and the  argument the fetus is not living so it has no rights to life or liberty ,1
769,i extend my arguments ,0
770,rape i think i have clearly stated multiple times that i am not against abortions for women that have been victims of rape . i do not know what to answer to the rest of your comment here since you spend most your effort on repeating what i said . medically speaking there are a lot of things we do that are only okay in some scenarios that does not make it okay to do in general ,0
772,i will be arguing that the use of physical force to defend the unborn is legitimate and morally justified ,0
773,with this significant scientific disagreement i believe that until more substantial proof supports the  week limit we should to be safe make the limit at  weeks . i believe it is wrong to kill an adult human because they are a being with interests . if pregnancy lasted only  weeks not enough time to make the decision you claim then would it be right to kill the newborn . i expect we also agree that a newborn baby has the same value as an adult human . at least until we have proof beyond reasonable doubt that fetuses feel pain we should set the abortion limit at  weeks . on with the debate right so a fetus at the moment of conception we agree is probably not worthy of having the same value as an adult human . it seems that the best place to draw the line is when the fetus goes from not having the same value as an adult human to having it ,0
774,unborn are humani have given a valid definition from an embryology book that attests to the fact that the zygote developmental stage is factually when a new human organism comes into being . i previously established that the unborn are humans and since humans have a rational nature humans are persons at every stages of life . since pro had no countering studies to the effect his only response was that the study was of a small sample size . defence of argumentpro has claimed that i have taken the pro life side and that is true but not exclusively so . it is merely an appeal to emotions and as such this argument has been disproven . once again this is contradictory to the premise of fundamental human rights and equality of people . since pro has failed to discredit the fact that the unborn are individual distinct human beings and did not disagree with the concept of fundamental human rights my argument stands in its entirety . the pro life refutation of this argument would counter that personhood is best described by the philosopher boethius a person is an individual substance that has a rational nature . additionally rationality and thus sentience is not something that is added to a human by the mother or some other agent but is rather an inherent attribute of humans that expresses itself to a greater degree over time . instead of refuting this claim with any scientific claim or knowledge to the contrary pro attempts to refute scientific fact with an imaginary blending of colours that represents the developmental stages of the unborn child . conclusioni have defended my original arguments and clearly shown why each of pros arguments fails to substantiate his argument . that is like arguing that because the plantation owner may have his finances adversely affected that he has a right to enslave some blacks . furthermore i have shown why pro arguing that the development of sentience is the dividing line between permissibility and impermissibility of abortion has actually caused him to lose the entire debate . argument  bad future for mother and child when rape involvedhere i went really soft on pro . thus by making the sentience argument pro has lost the debate because by using sentience as the dividing line one is forced to take the arguments to their conclusions ,0
775,what do you suggest should be done in the cases that occur where in the mothers life is at risk ,1
776,and if people only did what felt good then this planet would be corrupt and i do not support corruption nor do i support the reckless decision of murdering a baby that someone was irresponsible to make and not take care or even put up for adoption and yes i am serious about not having sex if you do not want to run the risk of getting pregnant . and sex is not a basic human need food water and shelter are basic human needs . so by disagreeing with me means that you condone murder and you stated ,0
777,another point he brings up is that abortion causes more fetal deaths than female deaths and thus criminalizing it is justified . yet no one thinks of abortion as a punishment for the fetus but rather it would seem like a punishment to the mother to be confined to raise this rapists child . the patient has no conscious experience or hope of cognitive functions as it has no brain what quality of life would there be to preserve . my opponent also argues that aborting such fetuses give credence to those who would want to kill those that have already been born . in the case of anencephaly i see no problem in terminating life support if it is the wishes of the parent but in cases where the baby is conscious then there is a difference as consciousness is what i noted as valuable . on the issue of rape or incest my opponent says that the child is not guilty of the fathers crime and thus not liable to punishment . i appealed to the fact that the fetus had no consciousness or hope of consciousness and would likely die soon after being born . there is clear harm in this in that the women would not have freedom over her own body but would be subjected to her fate once impregnated by the rapist to endure pregnancy and raising that undesired child . the person in the temporary coma can also communicate prior what their will would be for the situation while the fetus can only depend on the will of the mother in whom it inhabits . having a child is a huge potential burden and the harm of allowing a child into the world where it is unwanted or cannot be taken care of will only produce more harm . rebuttal  criminalizing abortions my opponent argues that because women choose to have abortions the harm they receive on account of that through illegal means should not be a justification . what he does claim is that no rational human being would freely consent to live in a society that permitted the killing of human beings yet every society on the planet does consent the killing of human beings . or that a women seeking abortion for the case of rape would be justly killed on account of her seeking out an abortion .  an abortion is also a way to remove one of the consequences of the rape nothing can undo the harm of that rape however it should be the choice of the woman whether or not to keep the rapists child .  this is of course and assumed point as it is not substantiated why moral assertions must be consistent or even that we should only treat others as we would consent to be treated ,1
778,the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime . a few centuries ago and of course in some countries up to this day women were viewed only as a reproduction tool to carry out their husbands genome . they were created to make sure our society functions orderly and to prevent as well as punish any act conducted by an individual or a group that may endanger the environment or society . does having an abortion will create an outbreak in crime or distort the order in the society . negative rebuttals then two points for his her argument . abortion is not a crime it is neither harmful to society nor the environment . round  affirmative give rebuttals to the four points that were made by the opposition ,0
779,in controlled conditions it is out of the egg ,1
780,us constitution  amendmenta lot of people site the constitution for the but the constiutional fact is that you have to be born in the united states in order for these rights to apply to you . john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that . unlike china the us is not able to simply harvest the organs of prisoners nor the dead without their consent . studies by university of california found that  of the women who are turned away from abortion are likely to become unemployed on welfare compared to the  that have abortions . a child that is not wanted and one that would because massive harm as well as dettremental effects to soceity should not have to be born into this world as it would simply just because everyone pain .  on top of this the cdc reports that  of all pregnancies are unintended . many people tend to site gun control or many other factors but the real solution was abortion . so even though it may or may not be alive it is not considered a us citizen hence have constitutional rights until they are born not at conception . they are also more likely to stay with their abusive partner leading to a higher amount of domestic violence . no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge theprivilegesorimmunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any statedeprive any person of life liberty or property withoutdueprocess of law nordeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . this is something that no one men women or children have to be forced to live through ,1
781,however i am religious so you did not convince me but your arguments certainly bested mine ,0
782,that autonomy disappears at the moment that society places a legal burden on you that prevents you from acting towards your own interests . pro is building his case entirely on the premise that a potential human can be murdered and he will have to support that by either proving that the early stages of development include the acquiring of personhood or that the supposition that the child will eventually obtain personhood is sufficient reason to call it murder . saying that abortion is murder implies that abortion is a unlawful b always premeditated and c that the fetus is by definition human . whether the woman got pregnant by mistake by rape or did so purposefully but now faces severe medical or financial pressures it is their body that has to bear that baby for  months and no external body should be able to require that of them . second we are talking about a lot of adoptions here . try adding all those children to an already overburdened underfunded adoption system that rarely finds homes for the children it has and basically all you get is a tremendous number of orphaned children who will be similarly neglected by society at large . i would say that abortion is most certainly lawful under the status quo and that pro has not really provided a reason why that is unreasonable ,1
783,if a woman does not want a baby she needs to close her legs or use birth control . it is truely an orwellian society when unborn babies are killed because the mother is too selfish to use birth control . the baby is a genetically different person with rights ,0
784,now I am not trying to offend anybody but i want to know where women got this so called right of abortion ,0
785, that is true but that same argument could apply to people in intensive care or more closely to comatose and hospitalized old people  well that fetus would be dead outside the mothers body anyway p but there is definitely a difference but in the long one not much since the fetus would eventually develop to be a baby  i don t really have much to say on this one just refer to   that is true this point is jut really    shelters are usually available or the government can intervene since its their job to make sure every citizen is safe trumps wall is not really realistic a fence is more likely if it actually happens ,0
786,i have either won this debate already or lost it already because i have no clue how to comprehend what the instigator just said ,1
787,and children in my opinion and i am a child cannot represent themselves adequately when it comes to such mature matters like abortion . i believe that all parents know what is in the best interest of their children no matter what the circumstances . and even if children are of making this decision that does not mean that the parents should be silenced . children are children they are naive ignorant and a lot of the time do not know their best interests . i do understand that abortion can be life threatening which is exactly why children should not be left to tend to it ,0
788,people can argue all they want about bettering the mother or the baby but what it comes down to is that abortion is the murdering an unborn fetus . i would like to inform you also of that fact that after having an abortion many times mothers become depressed and face relationship problems . you also argued quite a bit about how the well being of the mother is rarely taken into consent . the event of having an abortion almost always puts more of an emotional burden on the mother than they would have had if the baby was born . the top three reasons for having abortions would be can not afford the baby  of abortions unready for responsibility  and the mother is concerned with how the baby will change her life ,0
789,its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate . its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate ,0
790,obviously when the babys brain starts developing is important to you so allow me to share a fact a babys brain spinal cord and other vital organs begin forming at week  of the pregnancy . answering your question again the fetus begins forming it is brain at week  some facts norma mcorvey from the roe v wade trial is a pro life advocate . abortion is an easy way out it is by no means responsible to end a child life to make yours easier . if you do not think you can love and care for your child the way you should let another set of parents who desperately want a child . so do you think a  year old should have the right to get an abortion without parental consent ,0
791,of course there is a risk but even people who could not support a child still want to have sex and if she gets pregnant we cannot get mad at her for wanting to have sex . also in case you did not know there are many mothers who feel too much shame to want to give their child up for adoption so that is not always a viable options for other reasons i stated previously . if a mother or parents cannot handle a child why force them to have it simply to satisfy the people who do not believe in abortion . in addition killing a child outside of the womb is murder inside the womb is abortion . before that in the womb it does not show enough qualities of a full human being to regard it as such which is a reason why abortion is allowed . what i meant was financially poor woman as in not enough money or resources to support the child . what i understood from it was that an accident like a car crash happened and the person became attached to you . i assume he is arguing about later in the pregnancy since that was my focus . so are you implying that woman should not be having sex since they run the risk of getting pregnant ,1
792,for the purpose of debate by accepting this challenge the opponent agrees to the following definition abortion the intentional termination of a pregnancy by surgical procedure in which the death of the fetus is an intended result ,0
793,i would venture to say that what makes us human is our own conscience our volitional decisions a heart that beats and blood that flows . so whether or not a chickens baby is growing inside of an egg and you kill it to eat an egg has nothing to do with what is morally wrong because we are totally allowed to kill chickens and eat them . okay to clarify are we talking about the abortion of a chicken or the abortion of a human being . if one was to venture to say that you are not human if you are not fully formed then you would have to call a lot of handicapped people unhuman . if it does not make them any less human then that must mean that those things are never what made them human in the first place ,0
794,i include it however because any general account for the wrongness of killing will have something to say about case a the challenge this argument proposes for pro and myself is to provide a general account for the wrongness of killing with respect to b e that supports our view of case a in other words both pro and i must give an account of the wrongness of killing which can satisfy the  examples that i assume we would agree each has a right to life i e not to be killed and preserve our view of case a any view which fails this task simply cannot be a general account for the wrongness of killing . if pro wants to deny that she has to account for cases b e she will have to present an argument to defend such a view as killing in these cases is clearly prima facie morally wrong . in other words if killing can be wrong for numerous reasons pro has to exhaust avenues to show that none of these apply to case a any general account of b e which could then apply to case a provide a potential defeater for pro s view giving she seeks to exclude the unborn from the right to life . since the reason that is sufficient to explain why it is wrong to kill human beings after the time of birth is a reason that also applies to fetuses it follows that abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong . finally note that while i merely have to provide a sufficient condition for the wrongness of killing for cases a e pro must provide an account which is necessary . given that pro s only surviving justification is one of desiring to live or objecting to death and given that a teen in such a state would momentarily desire to die it seems that murder in this instance would be permissible on pro s account . plenty of victims do not experience this yet it is obviously wrong to kill them . in terms of desires it would seem that infants only exhibit them insofar as a foetus doe either implicitly or not at all . again a general account for the wrongness of killing can not be so precarious as to demand a third party be wronged so this point is easily swept aside .   given that flo account can address all the relevant examples and support my view in the contentious issue case a while pro s case is hugely defective it follows that abortion is generally morally impermissible . conclusion i want to close with the words of moral philosopher rosalind hursthouse who perfectly captures the profound nature of the issue to think of abortion as nothing but the killing of something that does not matter . it is obvious that this same reasoning would extend the right to life to my buddhist and alien example on similar grounds . I am not arguing that a foetus has the right to life because of its potential to become a person . given that this is my first debating round I will leave pro s affirmative argument for abortion the case of bodily rights to the next round . harm to loved ones of the victim it is trivially easy to undermine the first condition . however i will have to engage with his first argument regarding the morality of killing in this round as it directly challenges my case for the moral impermissibility of abortion . death robs the victim of their most basic desire to continue living in the most egregious way possible therefore it is prima facie wrong ,0
795,they make the woman feel guilty for wanting to abort the child and or having such sexual activities ultimately dismissing compassion where it is needed . when in actuality abortions can have a beneficial effect on the mother in numerous different scenarios lowering the risk of death to the mother during labor lowering the risk of having to use scarce finances to care for a child and it especially helps when the woman has been raped or was involved in unwanted incest . there is not a consensus to when a human life begins that argument is flimsy due to the fact that sperm and egg are living and it could be argued that they too have human life . yet most of the sperm is wasted and almost two thirds of human conception is spontaneously aborted by nature itself . i can only assume that is derogatory meaning that it is badly affecting the mother and the child ,1
796,the points i gave above only supported abortion when the womans or the childs life is in danger . and if not why are you arguing with me when I am merely arguing that the fetus should be prioritized . the limit i believe is that the mother if she does opt to have an abortion a practice i do not support should have the abortion early in the first trimester . in conclusion a mother sometimes has the right to have her wishes of an abortion supported rather than the life of the infant . i already stated in the comments which you seemed to either ignore or not understand that the word sometimes threw off the resolution and implied that any single argument from either side would fulfill the resolution ,1
797,the reason abortion is and always should be legal is a matter of the personal right too make a choice .   economics one of the reasons a mother has an abortion is because the father walks out on her or she simply can not afford to have a baby at the time . even if the answer of child support is there is no way she could ever get it what about in family adoption . i know you seem to think adoption is an easy option and in some circumstances it may be but certain places both in the us and around the world do not have adequate adoption facilities programs so they could be made similarly to an unheathy babies . if the father walks out on her she can get child support if they were married can she not ,0
798,the law says that your parents are responsible for your education health and well being .  legal aspects of healthcare administration george d pozgar the body of law as it applies to minors is based on the constitution however as a minor you are subject to the instructions and policies set forth by your parents . parental authority in operating an orderly household trumps all else if these conditions are met ,0
799,in response to me arguing that innocent human life is not to be terminated do to respect for human dignity and the right to life my opponent responds you may have a moral rules laws and maybe abortion is out of moral but you can not require or force somebody to live according to the rules set by society if it contradicts the liberty of person you have no choice . in response to me stressing the importance to the right to life my opponent says if your laws are wrong then it is time to change your law . the reason unalienable rights exist is because we need an objective foundation from which all rights may transcend in order to make the most efficient and morally sound society as possible . in response to my argument on the importance of the right to life my opponent says you have a right to leave baby has a right to live on but the woman has also right not to destroy her life so that the baby can live on i do not understand what my opponent is saying due to atrocious grammatical mistakes . my opponent finishes his arguments by providing stories that are supposed to be comparable to abortion but instead brings stories that are flawed due to the human not having absolute dependency on the provider . my opponent is in essence arguing that we cannot force anyone to go against their own personal liberty therefore the individual should have the right to do anything even if it means the termination of another s life . my opponent s arguments are also flawed because under his logic a parent can simply stop providing for a very young child that can not take care of itself because we apparently have the right to stop providing others . the unborn child has complete dependency on the mother therefore meaning that the woman has the moral obligation to carry this child and then when possible may either choose to continue caring for the child or give it up for adoption . the thing is the stories are extremely flawed and cannot be compared to abortion at all ,0
800,instead of trying to reign em all in and respond to em especially the ones that invovolve semantics I will just leave it to the voters ,1
801,what gives you the right to determine what anyone can and cannot do with their own selves ,1
802,con seems to be saying that forcing a pregnant woman to give birth a woman who wants an abortion because they do not want a baby or can not have a baby through financial problems age etc . to clarify i am not saying that the lives of all orphans are terrible but that is not the point . the point is that children should have a family who wants them and cares for them at the beginning and if the woman was forced to be a mother it is most likely that they do not desire the baby much less care for it ,1
803,well you could forfeit or make a stance i suppose ,1
804,she does not want to drop out of school when she did not even choose to be pregnant so obviously she would get an abortion . what if an innocent women gets raped but she happens to only be  years old . she does not want to drop out of school and have no future therefore she would get an abortion so her life would not be ruined ,1
805,because my opponent has not refuted the claims i made in my initial argument regarding abortion in cases of rape or medical necessity i have satisfied my burden . in not responding to those claims let alone refuting them my opponent has implicitly agreed thus violating the terms of his own burden . it is very difficult to continue this debate as my opponent has not responded to any of my arguments ,1
806,there is no reason why a mother would abort a baby for no reason without the fathers approval unless she was raped . pro is right when he says that unborn babies feel more pain than any of us would and that is exactly why doctors use anesthetics during abortions . the whole purpose of anesthetics is to minimise or prevent pain from being felt which it does a good job of . most abortions in the us are carried out are because the couple feel they cannot afford the baby the couple are concerned the baby will negatively affect their lives or that they are having trouble with their relationship and want to avoid single parenthood .  therefore my point stands that abortions can relieve couples of future suffering and problems if they think they cannot support the child ,1
807,so any pretense that abortion is not killing is a signal of our ambivalence a signal that we cannot say yes it kills a fetus faye wattelton planned parenthoods longest reigning president . i will be taking the position that abortion is wrong unethical immoral etc . i am not sure what my opponent will debate here to show abortion is wrong but i am sure it will be interesting .  i think we have deluded ourselves into believing that people do not know that abortion is killing . definition of abortion killing a fetus aborting a pregnancy to show the gravity of the situation here are some statistics in   ,0
808,with the economy as bad as it is and the population so high it will force an increase in need so they would fund more orphanages but less money ,1
809,anyone should be allowed to have an abortion if the do so wish as it is their body their choice . being told you have to have a child is just plain wrong . if you are not ready for a child and see all your friends having fun could you possibly grow to resent the baby stopping them from living ,1
810,on a side note i did not respond to your comment on sin because i believed it would bring us into a whole other argument off topic from this one ,0
811,elective abortion is any abortion done not for medical necessity ,0
812,the reason why i believe this is because it will develop into a human ,0
813,send me a challenge if you do I am up for it ,0
814,children are not capable of making any decisions for themselves without the input of their parents . since a minor is still being cared for by the parent then parents have to right to either grant or not grant an abortion without input from their daughter . minor someone under the age of  i believe that minors should be required to get permission from their parents to receive an abortion ,0
815,the pros position is that the abortion of fetuses which do not endanger the mother are immoral and should be outlawed by proper legislation . this belief is based on the idea that there is a set of natural processes which eventually leads to a human being outside of the womb . this is dangerous because it deters basic human worth which can lead to the murder of millions of people . now to begin the case for why abortion should be outlawed if the life of the mother is not endangered by the fetus . the pro would also like to ask the con if the con believes that abortion is a terrible act no matter the justification for it ,0
817,my opening argument is a rebuttal and a defense for the morality of abortion along with the prima facia morality of abortion . my opponent would have us believe that n the face of it it is morally wrong to kill another human being . there is no reason why anyone should consider abortion as an act of self defense and prudence obliges us to assume that it is a human in the absence of any good reasons to think otherwise .  rebuttals my opponents arguments can be summed up as followed the unborn entity from the moment of conception is a full fledged member of the human community it is prima facia morally wrong to kill any member of that community every successful abortion kills an unborn entity a full fledged member of the human community therefore every successful abortion is prima facia morally wrong conclusion as i have demonstrated an unborn entity is not a full fledged member of the human community it is not always prima facia morally wrong to kill a member of that community and every successful abortion is not always prima facia morally wrong . it is a fact that a   month old fetus has none of the above criteria hence they cannot have a serious right to life and it is not prima facia wrong to abort the potential child . in her essay the moral and legal status of abortion warren suggests five  criteria for a being to be qualified as a person that is protected morally and under the law  consciousness  reasoning  self motivated activity  capacity to communicate  presence of self concepts self awareness . for example if the mothers life is at risk it is obviously not prima facia wrong for the woman to have an abortion . philosopher judith thomas demonstrated a scenario in which a woman is kidnapped and wakes to find that she has been surgically attached to a world famous violinist who for  months needs her body to survive . in fact it is arguable that denying the woman a right to abortion in the case of a pregnancy is morally wrong . thus my argument can be considered the following  it is not prima facia wrong to kill a non human being . however i ask my opponent if the adult did not have a conscious and was a vegetable so to speak how can that being have a serious right to life ,1
818,no sane person would say the victim should be able to be terminated . why is it not okay to kill a second outside the womb when a second earlier inside the woman it was anything goes . that the doctor might use pain killers etc does not detract from the fact that he has killed the baby and the other arguments we are having . i acknolwedge that late term abortions esepcially are done by far for health reasons of the mother and such .  why would we legalize the latest most trivially based abortions just because the mother might do it anyway ,0
819,middle class and rich women by definition have more than enough money to go to other countries to get the procedure done quickly if need be . granted getting an abortion may be difficult for poor women who may or may not have the resources to do so but they are not included in my resolution . everyone has a place in this world ,0
820,why abortion is immoral my argument is as follows premise  abortion is the deliberate killing of a human foetus premise  a human foetus is alive and so therefore a human foetus is a living human being premise  it is immoral to remove the life of a human being conclusion abortion is immoral now i will support my premises premise  abortion is defined as expulsion from the uterus of the products of conception before the fetus is viable . there are many reasons why i am justified in asserting this moral truth rule utilitarian approach having a rule stating do not kill human beings will result in a greater amount of happiness than the absence of such a rule therefore this it is moral to abide to this rule . if my opponent disagrees and argues that killing of human beings is morally justified aside from cases of self defence then he will have the burden of proof as he is making the positive claim that killing of human beings is morally justified .   we know due to the definition of viable in this context that this procedure will necessarily kill the foetus .  unless of course the pro abortionist would consent to being killed if they were a human foetus but i highly doubt they would be serious in holding this conviction . summarily the killing of human beings is immoral according to the vast majority of normative ethical theories . deontologist approach killing of a human being is wrong because it is a maxim that cannot be universalised no rational human being would freely consent to live in a society that permitted the killing of human beings ,0
822,a higher rape rate would drive many to not have abortions as rape in many of these countries is the only case abortions are allowed .  all of these outcomes more out of wedlock births fewer adoptions than expected and less pressure on men to do the right thing led to a sharp increase in single parent families . as john lott notes he is a very respected man in the debate on both sides to understand why abortion might not cut crime one should first consider how dramatically it changed sexual relationships . for example the data used for the you k was not replicated and the trend was overall increasing even after controls for other variables where put on and at best had no effect on overall crime . foreign levitt made this claim to prove it had an international effect and this was an outrageous claim that was investigated by scientists and never replicated . first that one positive impact is outweighed by the negative ones and second that data is un replicated and suffers from methodological problems . as we can see in all of the countries where it is legal other factors explain the high abortion rates . again most analysis s show abortion had many more adverse social effects then positive ones which logically means levit s hypothesis is weak and that it is more likely it increases crime . yet when we look at the declining murder rate during the  we find that this is not the case at all .  children raised out of wedlock have more social and developmental problems than children of married couples by almost any measure from grades to school expulsion to disease . in the middle east they are in many wars and polygamy is very common . it was only later that criminality among those born after roe began to decline . many reside in africa the middle east or in latin america .  science and hebrew tradition on the method of zadig p  we can agree science should be able to often predict phenomena and the theory should be able to be correct right . the study found however the data failed to control for many controls ,0
824,having said that abortion seems like the easiest option in the eyes of young or poor women . aborting a baby at an early stage of the pregnancy makes it easier when there is hardly any . i agree that adoption is a better choice however adoption entails actually having the baby ,1
825,also interesting to note that in this clause the wording means that even if the prior logic that murder is being committed is not accepted then it is still wrong unjust because the unborn childs rights are still being violated as the declaration claims that they are created equal not born equal conclusion i have presented  very basic arguments and as needed will further explain and expand them . termination of a human fetus is murder many pro choice advocates claim that since the fetus has not yet been born it is not a human this is however incredibly untrue . even at the earliest stage of development the fetus has it is own unique string of dna not it is mothers but even more so than that it is human dna ,0
827,the assertion that obtaining an abortion is always the result of irresponsible behaviour is disrespectful to every woman undergoing an abortion ,1
828,the fetus cannot felt pain for the first  weeks during its formation because its brain is un der developed . they also report that around  of these rapes resulted in pregnancies that is about   pregnancies . how does my opponent feel about abortions in the case of rape . the rape abuse and incest national network reports that in     women were raped this of course applies only to reported rapes many rapes and other unwanted sexual advances go unreported . it is even inaccurate to say that abortion kills a fetus because a fetus was never alive in the first place . an organism without a heartbeat is considered not alive by most standards . my opponent states that abortion is wrong because it ,1
829,thank you minddrag for challenging me into this debate ,0
830, round points  points  rebuttal only   points pro must ff final round otherwise they lose the debate ,1
831,if they have an unplanned pregnancy it makes sense to be able to abort the baby so you do not have to go through the pregnancy at all . you can even say that the yet to be born baby is not alive as it would not be able to live without being in its mothers womb and an abortion will not be performed if the baby is past a certain stage of development . i think elective abortion is a right to women i am a man as women have the right to their own bodies ,1
832,most women would have the hardest decision of their life during this  weeks the real question on abortion is not if its should be legal but when should the cut off for an abortion be . if life is said as something that can live without the womb than the earliest a human is alive is  weeks into the pregnancy . gay marriage some find this still immoral but womans rights also should extend to the right to what they can and cannot do with their bodies ,1
833,sometimes they are prepared to be a mother then a complication arises after they have purposely become pregnant and they are forced to either kill the child or possibly die with it at birth ,1
835,like wise it is argued a pregnant women can take action to be unplugged from the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with her pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep them alive such is yours hers bodily rights freedom . con wrongly asserts that i assume a woman should not be allowed an abortion after the embryonic period as their counter arguments that rests upon that false assumption do not apply here .  mother vs fetus also consider a pregnancy where complications are such that either the woman or fetus can live but not both and fail to act means both die . the logical point is that any anti abortion argument that is built upon such an absolute right to life right not to be killed has at it is foundation a false premise and can be rejected as such not to mention the double standard of selectively applying it in the case of pregnancy to deny abortion rights . also consider a pregnancy where complications are such that either the woman or fetus can live but not both and fail to act means both die . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . freedom not restricted unless justifiedcon seems to agree with the point here and seeks to establish that abortion is murder in the embryonic period to justify not allowing such an abortion by a pregnant woman . i am open to the idea that maybe abortion should be more restricted in the later stages but being open to that possibility is not the same as just assuming it i would need to see arguments in support such a thing that can withstand critical scrutiny . if abortion is murder reducto argument recall here how i argued that if you accept the abortion is murder premise and apply it consistency and follow it is logic where it gets you mass incarceration of woman death penalty where applicable who have had an abortion in the embryonic period . also consider if such an abortion is viewed as murder the rapist gets convicted of rape but following after is the woman who he raped is now in court because she had such an abortion and thus gets convicted of murder . con thinks this is wrong because they are assuming that any and all human organisms make it a person because of its humanity i do not think that is tenable for the following reasons . in the embryonic period the human organism has no current capacity to have an active or ideal desire an ideal desire being a desire which would exist had there not being a cognitive distortion . the argument here still is that the human organism in the embryonic period is not a person and thus does not have a right to life however that right is defined ,1
836,the law says that your parents are responsible for your education health and well being .  legal aspects of healthcare administration george d pozgar the body of law as it applies to minors is based on the constitution however as a minor you are subject to the instructions and policies set forth by your parents . while the bible is not the best source of morality i would agree i was merely stating even back then people wrote about the rights of a minor and the obligations of the parents . parental authority in operating an orderly household trumps all else if these conditions are met . in the mythical world you would live in a  yr old would be thrown into the streets to fend for him herself and a  old can do as he pleases and if he is harmed so be it there is no moral obligation of the parent to see no harm comes to their child and to you the harm to a child is justice for the child actions ,0
837,a fetus may not be considered its own human being but because it is technically part of its mother it has the same rights . a baby is alive it exhibits all seven characteristics of life it is composed of cells it has different levels of organization within its body it uses energy it responds to its environment it grows its cells can reproduce it adapts to its environment to kill a living thing without any justification other than the mother is not ready is not worthy to be practiced in the united states .  what if the aborted baby finds the cure for cancer what if the aborted baby were to save a bus full of old people ,0
838,my opponent states in certain situations abortion is appropriate but if they are so young and its not rape its there own fault . out of all the women who have abortions  are unmarried . teens take up  and women aged   take up the remaining  ,1
839,these are the only arguments my opponent has advance so now i guess i will wait for him to respond and expand ,1
840,again the woman would find a way to have her baby terminated which would be more painful than the legal process already is . while my views differ from yours i would like to address that yes abortion is wrong in a sense but it should be a choice as I have defended and will finish off in this last post but before i do so i will go over a few points that we have agreed and most would agreed on . if we are going to impose such laws then i do not see why stop there go full frontal with masturbation laws . it would also do more harm for the babies and because more pain to them as if they do not have enough pain enough through the scary abortion processes . the slavery period was in a completely different time but i guess that is the more valid comparison you made out of these two . women should not be modern day slaves and have to carry such burdens . it would seem to me most pro lifers are selfish and have to have it their way like burger king or something . as for handicaps and such not having personhood and everything they are already out of the womb and are special cases . c not a win situation for the mother regardless of what decision she makes ,1
841,back to the debate here is a study done by docters on how many abortions are done total number of abortions in the you s    . yet after he she is born it is not ok .  million abortions per day   abortions per hour   abortions every  minutes  abortion every  seconds and when you said it is up to the mother for the abortion ,0
842,i heard you wrong ,1
843,looking forward to a great debate ,1
844,it also strengthens our system because it shows that we can be against something in principle but it is not like we do not understand the countervailing considerations and have our laws reflect that accordingly . the laws would be clear abortion is illegal but there are no consequences for violating them . while i respect old chinese proverbs and such i do not see the point in that saying ,0
845,they shold have the right to life ,0
846,whoever has the courage to be reminded of a horrible incedent every day of her life when she looks at the one thing that she thought would ever matter to her . if a mother is not at risk of death then of course she has every right to abort the pregnancy . if the mother is at risk of death as before she has every right to abort the pregnancy ,1
847,introductioni thank pro for the opportunity to debate this topic ,1
848,in pre pregnancy diabetes raises risk of birth defects donya  report that women diagnosed with diabetes before they become pregnant are three times to four times more likely to give birth to a child with one or even multiple birth defects than a non diabetic mother according to a study in the august. neither had a job and they knew that they could not afford to buy food and provided medical care for their baby . my friend got an abortion even though it was the hardest decision of her life . having a child who reminds you of such a horrible experience is not a nice thing . another reason that women should be able to have abortions is in case the mothers are too young and unable to take care their babies . therefore no one has the right to tell a woman what she can or can not do with her body . first women have the right to control their own bodies . therefore it is right if a woman chooses to get abortion in this case . however when a womans health is at risk or they will give birth to a child with defects then abortion would be better for the mother and for the baby . if a woman gets pregnant and she has a history of heart disease then continuing the pregnancy would put both her and her baby at risk . if we know the child will be born with defects then there is no point in having have the mother keep the baby if she chooses not to ,1
849,to think that the lives of infants are of special value because infants are small and cute is on a par with thinking that a baby seal with its soft white fur coat and large round eyes deserves greater protection than a gorilla who lacks these qualities . in order to address my opponent s arguments I will split them into the major reactions the criticisms of my case the substance view and the potentiality argument which my opponent has dubbed the flo . regarding the boring issue of technicality namely sources whilst i do not hold it against my opponent as it was entirely accidental i am sure he has misrepresented a source and thereby strawanned again mistakenly singer s position and as such i feel this ought to be kept in account . singer himself universally acknowledged as one of the most important bioethicists of our time cannot teach in germany any more due to the attacks done on him and the lectures he has hosted by his opponents . to conclude i shall reiterate the words of pro life advocate john noonan life itself is a matter of probabilities if a spermatozoon is destroyed one destroys a being which had a chance of far less than  in  million of developing into a reasoning being possessed of the genetic code a heart and other organs and capable of pain . so any theory which claims the life of a fertilised egg is worth more than a human person needs to be rejected instinctively . however the importance is that all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person . in fact as taxonomy is entirely vague and arbitrary we might as well include apes and others they share our genetic type very strongly . to claim this says it is acceptable to kill all newborn infants is a complete misrepresentation which only can come from a misrepresentation of his position by those wishing to slight him of which there are many or worse a purposeful malice . to add the context to the quote the paragraph goes in thinking about this matter we should put aside feelings based on the small helpless and sometimes cute appearance of human infants . my opponent s ethical theory should be held to the same standard and dismissed on the same ground . the opponents however are not pro lifers but instead the disabled community who attack his position . and finally the episodic problem again does not exist when we realise that one is still has characteristics    and  when asleep and   and  when in a coma of warren s code ,1
850,i am forfeiting my debate because i realize i was wrong ,1
851,not become homeless or something stupid like what you said . there will not be any survivors to be in prision . i have been deing to redeem myself and this is the perfect oppurtunity ,1
853,but i want to get back to my main point and that is if they have sex knowing the possible consequences whether they try to prevent it or not they should be held responsible period . and you say that it can not be consider killing since it has not developed its organs so what you are still preventing it from having a life so you are taking its life and in that matter it is murder . but if he had sex he knows the risks but does not care and if he gets a girl pregnant and since you do not think that adoption is good they both should be held responsible . because men do not have to worry about getting pregnant and I am not saying its not the males fault either in fact its equal but if a girl gets an abortion than its not holding anybody responsible . and the only reason i say its ok with rape is because it is not the womans fault but when its consensual sex it is the womans fault ,0
854,abortion is only acceptable for those who have been sexually assaulted but usually that is not the case may i remind you it is the womans choice to have intercourse and that they should now the risks that that carries so to finish my statement i believe that abortion is a violation of the unborn childs rights ,0
855,i extend all my contentions ,1
856,it is only when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell that potential has been created and thus removing it is destroying potential . the only incidences in which the action of abortion prevents more harm than it causes is when the child has a genetic disorder that would be debilitating or incapacitating and prevent it from living a normal life . for this point to be relevant my opponent would need to demonstrate that this right is grounded in morality . this defeats the and arguments as in each case an entire life is worth more than part of one in addition to the other imbalances mentioned above . if the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not in theory and in practice acknowledged to be an end nothing could ever convince any person that it was so .   in summation my opponents contentions fail to address the moral standards for the issue and equivocate terms as well as misuse scientific and political ideas . however these disorders are incredibly rare and do not apply to the general rule i am arguing for in place of an absolute one ,0
857,the right to life right not to be killed as an absolute is untenable what do you say to this contention after a pregnant woman s embryotic period . just to keep time frames consistent ll be taking about the pregnancy from conception fertilization to birth roughly  days . if abortion is murder reducto argument i m not here to debate what the law should state and penalty actions if restricted abortion is illegal . what test can a doctor preform to verify a baby is now human and we should protect the innocent human life . pro claims it is okay to terminate a human during their embryotic development .  pro constructs a baby is non human during the embryotic period in which science has proven otherwise it is important to note that embryological evidence shows that the human embryo is a whole although obviously immature human being it is not a mere part . unjust burden argument pro will force women against their will if pregnant after the embryotic period  days total of  days . pro s only contention to this statement is during the embryotic period . why doesn t pro stay the course through the entire pregnancy and contend abortion should be legal . for the best protection of innocent human life we should indeed protect a human life when it begins at fertilization . if we subscribe to pro s argument we go against logical and scientific evidence that during the embryotic period the human embryo is fully programmed to actively develop and is indeed composed of human definable substance ,0
860,it is been great debating him and i look forward to engaging him in the future ,0
861,someone who wants a abortion is murdering a life depriving a life of what it may have become . my second standing point is why would you have sex when you realized the risk of a pregnancy if you did not want such a thing then why did you not have sex with a condom birth control or both for all i care . some say you can not get depressed over something like an aborted fetus but aha your wrong ,0
862,most families consider it to have a son as their single child because a son will look after them when they are old and because families of farmers need strong people to work for them . however it seems like you have nothing to say about any of my arguments so far so I will wait for replies for them and move on to opposing your other points . however if a couple really wanted a boy and there was no abortion what would they do . also as i have already proven a fetus or an embryo has never been so it cannot be . does this mean that all these are too important to die . as for my previous arguments they all still stand so i will not restate them here . as you said some parents abort when they find out that their baby will be a girl so that they can have another chance to make that single child a boy ,1
863, once again you have never proven it was a person or even a child .  animals are living things and people eat them . but you have not proven the unborn to be children yet ,1
864,no matter if it is her body or not it should still be considered murder ,0
865,but i believe that the limit now on abortion is fine . they both do not have feelings but it is the parental attachment .  weeks and the baby is barely developed is what i meant . have you ever listened to the song brick . she is now  but when she was  she was pregnant ,1
866,this argument is important in explaining that abortion is not about a malicious desire to or even to express their right to choose it is about allowing women to make the best choice ,1
867,forcing a woman to have a baby that she does not want is damaging to all parties involved whether the state the mother the father or another relative is taking care of it . a forced baby is something the mother does not want so can there be any emotional ownership towards the child from the mother .  to be the that expresses ownership and again what about in cases in which the mothers life is at risk ,1
869,organism an individual form of such as a plant animal bacterium protist or fungus a body made up of organs organelles or other parts that work together to carry on the various processes of life . as i have shown earlier abortion is not . it is not a person ,0
871,in your analogy the females or for that matter anyone else are not directly killing the parasites by choosing not to serve as their hosts .  thus far more sentient than a third trimester fetus in light of learning this would you stop eating pork . however it is in the power of the united states to allow all pregnant chinese women to come into the united states . if you are not certain which point of view you are in alignment with think about the following hypothetical example  every year thanks to the one child policy chinese women across the country have no choice but to have abortions because the government mandates this as a population control . if your answer is yes then  ,1
872,the fetus will become a human so by killing it you are not even allowing it the right to become a human and have a life . suicide is the third leading because of death among those   years old . suicide is the sixth leading because of death among those   years old ,1
873,even though a cannibal has the freedom of religion it is not okay for them to eat someone in their religious ritual because it violates the rights of the person being eaten . yes you are right in the sense of protecting rights but if this religion you used as an example also required that the first born boy was used as a sacrifice that would naturally be illegal . in the same way the right for the baby as a human being to live overrides the right for the woman to do with her body what she pleases ,0
874,i have pointed out the flaws in my opponents argument and have received zero rebuttals ,0
875,it should not be legal under any circumstance and i look forward for a debate ,0
876,everyone can agree that this is a terrible waste of life and potentially very dangerous for the mother concerned and of course many people object strongly to abortion on moral grounds ,0
877,yes it is possible for anyone anywhere to be a very bright and productive child but the chances are lower if a childs surroundings are worse ,1
879,i would like to reiterate that the burden of proof still stands i must prove that abortion is just in just one case whereas my opponent must prove that it is unjust in every case . throughout the use of analogies initially presented by judith jarvis thompson professor of philosophy at mit i showed that in the case of rape or medical need abortion is not unjust . i will continue to focus on abortion in the case of rape or medical need as it is often the most cut and dry of the various reasons for seeking a termination of pregnancy ,1
880,i accept your definitions and interpretations ,1
881,nearly all the women said that they regretted the abortion and over  said they would discourage other rape victims from choosing abortion . rape may be an increasing issue however since the vast majority of rape victims choose other solutions it is simply not an issue regarding abortion . regarding rape you said statistics will increase soon because rape is an increasingly worrying issue however over over  per cent of women that got pregnant as result of rape did not choose abortion as a solution to that . if that is the only problem here we need a change of attitude in our society and i think we should work on that instead of encouraging abortion for young children . many doctors agree with me when i say biologically a woman is in her best shape to have her children from age   ,0
882,healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed .  to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do . abortion should not be allowed in cases where mothers life is at risk but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted ,0
883,but at the same time abortion can be good depending on the reason ,1
885,here are some things for you to consider parents cannot simply decide to refuse a medical treatment that is determined to be necessary and essential for their daughter by a physician such as a medical abortion or in the case of this news article from this week lymphoma the judge will base this on the patients wishes decision and the patients best interest health regardless of parents choice now the pros argument mainly surround the assumption that     summary  physicians do not assess the maturity of the patient in regards to decision making however this is only true in some situations . instead parents who are more experienced in such affairs shall make a decision that they think will most benefit their daughter here is my response to the numbered arguments above you need to consider one thing this is real life not a cliche made up world .  i believe that all parents know what is in the best interest of their children no matter what the circumstances .  bottom of page  i will simply disagree with the pros argument that parents can be better judges than physicians in regards to when a medical abortion is necessary to terminate an I will pregnancy that can physically harm the child . i do understand that abortion can be life threatening which is exactly why children should not be left to tend to it ,1
886,your previous round is a prime example of you use name calling in your debate which shows you are not only not worth my time of arguing but also a bad debater ,0
887,my opponent utterly fails to prove why we should make such a drastic claim to the status quo and then demonizes me for opposing his opinions therefore i urge you all  in this debate simply because my opponent gives you no reason to vote for them . so no i have warranted my opponent needing to win all six points in my prior speech which my opponent never touches on and i have further clarified it here . now as for the con side my opponent does not touch the three points i offer so they also go to the con . but what they do not understand is it is these restrictions that make such atrocities not happen in the first place . closing arguments so with that let us look to the pro side of the debate pro first on the framework my opponent accepts the burden of proof but claims that it is abusive to say they must win all six of their points to win this debate . second my opponent never warrants that it is just a so this argument is two fold not applicable . my character limit makes it impossible for me to not only copy paste my prior arguments and expand on them but it would also be irrelevant since is the last round and my opponent could not argue it back . now for my closing statements my opponent advocates that this debate is strictly that concerning but it goes far beyond that . his refutation also has not evidence to support his claim ,0
888,since you are apparently arguing the moral and not legal perspective i will attempt to rebut by showing that the choice of a woman to have an abortion is moral and even just ,1
889, according to the substance view of persons i still retain the same identity over time and i am entitled to unalienable rights such as the right to life property and freedom because of the very thing i am i e a human being . there is no reason why anyone should consider abortion as an act of self defense and prudence obliges us to assume that it is a human in the absence of any good reasons to think otherwise . he does this by presenting a self reflection of identity claiming that a fetus is a person because i was that fetus and being a person is an essential property of me pruss . as i look through the photo album heading backwards in time I am essentially the same entity in all those photos at different stages of development from being  years old now back to when i was  years old  years old all the way back to conception . it would be prima facie wrong to make a move and terminate the fetus when one is unsure of its personhood . premise  on the face of it it is morally wrong to kill another human being . it is not some foreign unknown entity or lump of cells that later became me . lastly the embryo from conception is a whole human being because it contains the genetic constituents of human beings and its cells all work together towards the whole of the organism thus making it whole .  now the issue is addressed by the following argument developed by francis j beckwith the unborn entity from the moment of conception is a full fledged member of the human community it is prima facie morally wrong to kill any member of that community every successful abortion kills an unborn entity a full fledged member of the human community therefore every successful abortion is prima facie morally wrong the argument is valid as the conclusion necessarily follows from its premises while assuming the premises are true . unless my opponent states otherwise I am assuming we both agree that objective moral values exist namely that acts such as murder are wrong independently of anyones beliefs about them . premise  follows from premise  and the conclusion from premise  and   in defense of premise one i cite an argument developed by alexander pruss that aims at demonstrating a fetus is a person with rights . before we can advance the issue of abortion we must simplify the matter and focus on one thing what is the fetus .  so even if all arguments for personhood fail at the moment the wisest thing to do would be to play it safe ,0
890,i say no you say yes make the first move ,1
891,if you can not protect yourself not rape mind you that baby should not be put down because of your mistake ,0
892,do i have to forfeit do they have to vote or what ,0
893,and because planned parenthood works with other companies both as a buyer of materials and seller of body organs lots of people are making lots of money . this included lots of animosity towards jews for whatever reason and hitler merely capitalized on this tension to get into power . they made the correct political move by absolutely ignoring the rest of america admittedly the minority by population because they knew that that voting block alone could get them into power . in a way it was as if the usa had been killing anyone opposed to the vietnam war which would essentially breed a country that loves war . and a big portion of that money should if the correct political move is being played here be going right back to the dem party so they can advertise for abortion . but the idea of a genocide and an abortion are very different as one is forced actively done on already grown up people and targeting a specific ethnic religious group while abortion simply targets the unborn . the companies do not mind since they can import workers as and then pretty much enslave them in any system and the voting block really cares .  but outside of the debate and my technical nit picky self I would still say pro is wrong to regard the resolution as true . those companies need the low skilled wage as low down as it can get and abortion is preventing them from getting a whole lot of money . in a way the post war democracy established in germany combined with the post war tensions allowed this to happen . this does not mean they are wrong of course ,1
894,i know that sounds extreme but you should not be allowed to raise a family if you have killed your own future children by having an abortion . i also know that are kids out there who might of had accidents while having sex but that does not simply mean you have to kill it . it also makes doctors look so hypocritical i mean their supposed to save lives not help one end another ,0
895,that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not . the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply . but there and earlier an argument could be made that earlier in the pregnancy she forfeits her right to not be pregnant by assuming that risk ,0
896,once one has been  months pregnant i believe it is too late to abort but again i say it must be an option . abortion needs to stay an option because of the reasons i listed above . every thing i say is most serious ,1
897,when considering the amount of abortions that take place in illegal countries it is not a stretch to say that at least  of those abortions would still take place criminally or   if abortion were outlawed in the you s thus my opponent needs to prove the abortion crime effect in his favor that it increases crime to win the debate . yet the only link he gives to crime is a slight increase in murder of  i was unable to access the first source so i could be wrong . the earliest abortion statistics i could find were from  when  . another flaw in his analysis is that my opponent asserts that because of its legality there are more abortions occurring than if it were illegal which i would agree with . measuring the crime of potential lives is drastically harder than even finding how many uncaught illegal abortions occurred before roe v wade so i will assume that unborn children have no effect on the crime rate for arguments sake . i tried to go a different route but now i will also use various statistical arguments to point out the abortion crime effect which brings me to  my first argument had nothing to do with the abortion crime effect but rather abortion itself . he could offer a much lower number of illegal abortions that would occur than mine but he would still need to prove the abortion crime effect in his favor . if he cannot somehow correlate   crimes to the legalization of abortion than this would prove that the illegalization of abortion increases crime since all those women getting illegal abortions would count as crime which is merely stating the resolution in the negative . it is important to note that crime does not have to be witnessed or caught to be considered crime which is the inherent flaw of criminal statistics they cannot point out crimes that were never found out ,1
899,there are many examples of the bombing of planned parenthood abortion clinics and the harassment of abortion workers ,1
900,even if a women decided to choose life she may be subjected to putting her child in the hands of the man who attacked her . in the case of incest the child is at a high risk for defects and disorders something that would bring pain and suffering to both the mother and the child . the adoption system in the you s is not the best either ,1
901,i believe that abortion clinics should not be government funded or taxpayer funded ,0
902,as for his statement that no one gets an abortion unless they need one that is utterly wrong most people go straight to this option ,0
903,even if a family can put the child up for adoption this may not make the childs life any better nor the mothers life . this can have detrimental effects on a womans life health and sanity as well as other negative repercussions eg . statistic shows that  of all pregnant women experience health problems and  of women endure complications that are considered life threatening . now i shall present my case . there are not enough parents willing to adopt children meaning babies will be placed in orphanages at the expense of tax payers ,0
905, merriam webster now as my first point i will start out in saying that i think the biggest issue that and believers have is when life begins . I am sorry that this is not traditional debating style my thoughts tend to get scattered i look forward to your reply and feel free to bring up any points you would like me to comment on . i feel that it is un educated to say that people who are against abortions and also that people who are for abortion . if you believe like most pro choice people that life begins at birth then why are not abortions done later in the term . life begins when the sperm and the egg are joined to form a potential child ,0
906,I am going to be talking about the very controversial topic on a mans right in the say to a abortion I will have reasons like how no one should have their child stolen away when you did nothing wrong women should have to keep the kid but are allowed to opt of of being a parent and men and women should have the same rights as a parent . your all excited telling your friends family and in the highlight of it all your baby is gone you are told you are not having the baby you have no choice in the matter you are just denied the your right to have a child . i want you to take a second and imagine you are an adult and you got the great news that you are having a baby ,0
907,if you want to enter this debate you should believe that there are at least some cases when a pregnant person should not have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion ,1
908,a women should be allowed to make the decision of choosing abortion or not . sometimes life can be really harsh on us . so are we being fair to the child ,1
909,if a fetus consents to the abortion it should not be considered immoral ,1
910,it is important to remind them that disabled people are still autonomous becausethey don t live inside the body of another person and suck up their nutrients . there are no detectable brain waves that would translate to pain or fear until  weeks a point after which abortion is rare and illegal . some animals eat poisonous plants and some even walk through spaces too small for them to crush the fetus . simple you are hurting someone unconsensually they object to being killed and feel mortal danger and they have friends and family who will mourn . if abortion is illegal dead people will officially have more rights than pregnant people because a dead persont be used if they aren t an organ donor . if human sex were only for procreation the clitoris which plays a role in pleasure but no role in reproduction would not exist .  many will claim that sex is only for pro creation therefore it s only fair to punish people for having sex with an unwanted pregnancy ,1
911,why would you kill an innocent child ,0
912,abortion should be illegal ,0
913,i can concede that we need to provide euthenasia for children that will be at a disadvantage or will endure a particularly stressful life such as someone born with aids a terminal disease or born out of incest or rape . this is an outlandish comparison as an appendix is a useless part of the human anatomy while a fetus is the development stage of a conscious being . this right shall be protected by law and in general from the moment of conception . obviously this points to the bare fact that a human fetus does esentially deserve rights . also the long standing position of the american convention of human rights upheld since  states that every person has the right to have his life respected . this decision effectively characterizes a fetus as a legal victim and by this decision it can be inferred that it has the rights of an individual . from the moment of it is conception a fetus has certain traits that would define it as a person ,0
914, once you are already pregnant there is no that you can take because the baby is already alive . let me give another example if a cancer patient is told he is supposed to die should we just kill him and get it over with .  in the case of rape this is a tiny bit different but less than  of abortions are due to rape also just because the babies dad is a rapist does not mean the baby should not have a chance at life . technically the baby is a part of the mother but the baby itself is a unique human being all it is own why should the mother be able to kill her baby since it has no way to defend his or herself . the thought of that innocent baby dying because they were selfish haunts a ton of women for the rest of their lives ,0
915,a fetus is a human being and thus being so has the basic rights to life ,0
916,I will be the pro life defender ,0
917,if there is not an end all be all right to life for any set of cells we should concede that the utility of already participating members of society should receive due deference in relation to the utility of non participating sets of cells . we certainly do not afford and for good reason i am not trying to appeal to the status quo alone the same right to organisms that display the same faculties and behavior . such a heuristic is appropriate because it is most likely to increase the overall utility of members of society while any heuristic that values the utility of non members does not serve society by definition ,1
918,it is not it is own life yet and the embryo would not be concious until it developed a brain which happens later into the pregnancy . there has to be a sanction for breaking a law whether that is a fine or a prison sentence . but anyways the first trimester is the best time to abort the pregnancy as all the embryo is at this point is a ball of stem cells ,1
919,these innocent female teens are forced to pay the child support along with school bills and college money ,1
920,if you disagree post why and I will tell you why i disagree with your opinion and vise versa ,1
921,having an abortion will reduce the stress on families who can not afford a baby . if a woman will die because of the birth of a baby then abortion is a reasonable choice .  because of those  reasons you should  ,1
922,conclusioni have clearly shown that the unborn are  individual members of the human race and the living children of both parents  that the foundation of our justice system is that everyone is created equal and thus equal before the law  that the justification for abortion is just another form of  parents have a duty to provide for minor children until they are able to provide for themselvesas noted in my introduction the next couple of rounds will be used to pit the best arguments against my position in order to show that the father should have no say over whether the mother should or should not have an abortion i invite pro to continue the presentation of their argument . however i will show over the next couple of rounds that this is only an apparent disconnect because the greater truth of the nature of the unborn child is being ignored . by using the term father and not some qualifying term like future father in the debate topic pro has conceded that the unborn is already the child of both parents . mammals have the added ability to protect and nurture their young within the mother until a much later stage of development . pros use of the word in the debate title would indicate that this is the governing factor in the debate . i will follow this round up with the best pro arguments i can think of or find anywhere else on the internet and show them to be inadequate to prove the pro side of the debate . pro choice not a personif the unborn tissue is not a person then it should have no legal standing and it is classified as merely a part of the mothers body or her property to do with as she pleases and the father should have no say . it is a resolution that both the pro life side and pro choice sides can agree upon as this is fundamentally a debate about personhood . an issue that both those who are pro life and pro choice will refute as neither side would agree that the father should ultimately have any say in the decision to abort for completely opposite reasons . this is a prejudice based solely on a single characteristic of the other person that attempts to dehumanize them in one fashion or another . additionally the law would not permit me to intentionally kill my child after birth first degree murder murder occurs where the person who causes the death of a human being means to because his death or means to because him bodily harm that he knows is likely to because his death and is reckless whether death ensues or not . this fundamental right is not to be confused with privileges granted by the state such as the right to drive vote etc . humanity has a history of the powerful denying the rights of the weak based on personal prejudice or selfish motive ,1
923,a black defendant on trial for murder is  more likely to be given they death penalty than a defendant of any other race and nearly  of all victims in death penalty cases are white despite the fact that whites make up only about  of all murder victims . also killing a person that has shown a they have no respect for another persons right to live is actually defending life . being opposed to abortion saying it is murder to kill a child that is alive and growing inside you that you created is very pro life . if we had a standard for the death penalty like any type of murder results in the death penalty which is to be carried out within a year or after their first and only appeal . think about the lifers in prison they are the most dangerous people in that prison simply because they have nothing to lose . the death penalty is a penalty it is not a random thing they do not pull people off the street and execute them on a whim . but another thing that is typically liberal is to accuse everything they do not agree with as being racist . saying that  people could have been wrongfully executed is not a reflection of the death penalty in any way . conservatism is giving people a lot of freedom but holding them responsible for their actions . china executes around  people a year and they have a low violent crime rate . you say finally one more argument against the death penalty states that its application is unequal and discriminatory . rather than execute them you would have them being a danger to other inmates as well as guards . i also have a definition for you hypocrite  ,0
925,even a preteen knows that she should be on some sort of birth control if they are having sex . i believe even for a high risk surgery women no matter the age should have the final say on what is to be done to their own bodies . patients are able to go home the same day after an abortion and do not require much to recover ,1
926,the argument i actually made i essentially made the following argument in my affirmative speech that does not beg the question on positive rights but justifiably assumes their existence from moral experience lest i be charged with only arguing for positive rights in this conclusion if born children have a right to assistance or a positive right to life from their parents and unborn children have the same rights that born children have it follows that unborn children have a right to assistance from their parents . if we can generally trust our five empirical senses even though we only assume they give us reliable information about the world then why not with the same confidence trust our moral sense that says persons are valuable and have intrinsic rights . i do not feel any obligation to defend the first premise born children have a right to assistance from their parents because it seems obviously true to anyone with moral reasoning abilities . but if you thought that the baby s right to be fed is incoherent because it denied her parent s so called right to self ownership and therefore it was moral for them to care for a virtual baby instead of their own child then i can confidently say that your moral sense is simply broken . the declaration boldly states without need of philosophical justification the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world everyone has the right to life liberty and security of person . con does not dispute the humanity or equality of rights present in the unborn because it was the debate resolution but he instead goes after a much larger metaphysical target for his rebuttal . consider the following true story march   a south korean couple arrested for allowing their baby to starve to death had been raising an online child state media reported citing police sources . therefore infants who are incapable of rational discourse but whose growth and development is necessary for it must be kept safe until they can fend for and protect themselves . con is arguing for the ethical theory known as voluntarism or the claim that i have no duty to aid anyone else unless i freely say i want to aid them . consider the universal declaration of human rights issued by the united nations just a few years after the unthinkable crime of the holocaust . i contend that the right to life for persons is as self evidently true as the wrongness of trivial discrimination among persons ,0
928,access to an abortion should be legal for these reasons . it was not until the  that abortion was illegal in every state and even then it was still permissible in certain circumstances . the truth is that women facing poverty abuse or simple lack of preparation will seek abortions if they want them ,1
930,but i do not think its right my reason being that i feel it will lead to something much worse that you might not support but these infanticidophilic people will use your same arguments against you . i clearly said i think if a woman is raped she should be given a choice . again i think if a woman is raped in all politically correctedness she should be able to have an abortion ,0
931,yet what if a woman had been raped and never wanted the baby but she has no choice she will have to go through many processes that will be stressful and may even because her to gain weight which will make her less attractive which causes depression either way also what would happen to the child if he found out his mother never wanted him and his father is a rapist in jail ,1
932,if the mother is under  and raped we should not allow the baby to die for it . if the baby is healthy there is no reason the baby would have to die in this situation . i would not squabble too much and understand though if you simply disagreed and it was on the specific point of allowing abortion for those underage and raped even later in pregnancy ,0
933,  if a murderer killed his pregnant wife and provided more than enough evidence that she and she alone was going to have an abortion would the judge and jury simply nod their heads and say well if she was going to abort the child anyways . writing them off on something as simple as whether or not they can feel pain or survive by themselves is not a good measure of human status . any human fetus on the other hand has about a  chance of growing to become a human being like you or i if you could show me such positive evidence that an insect had the potential to become a rational emotional thoughtful and intelligent human being you can bet i would not step on it . the simplest way to answer this entire question is to show the fact that the murder of a pregnant woman is two counts of homicide . pregnancy can be potentially dangerous and it is safe to assume that most people know this . the amount of days or weeks at which an unborn baby can feel this that or the other is irrelevant . when taken off their tubes and life support they too can die ,0
934,or do you agree she should have that right and if so how do you make a meaningful distinction especially given the anaology and simple logic that the baby is still a baby regardless of if it is in the womb or outside the womb . you have not conceded that a woman should be able to abort a week before her due date just because she wants to and not for a commonly thought of exception . also you did not respond to the analogy which is also based on reason . plus according to your logic if they have equal rights that does not mean the woman can kill it given the consideration mentioned . con asks me to explain the basis for the infants rights . my only contention is that sometimes the woman should not be able to abort . and the assumption of risk point which you have not addressed also gives basis for infant rights ,0
935,last thing you said having a baby is not as easy for some people . some things should be universal such as peace but that will never happen . but why get pregnant if you dint want the kid . giving an unwanted birth takes a toll on a lot of people . if you search you get over three million hits ,1
936,i do not think a guy could have one of those anyways I am talking about the abortion cases where they got pregnant and just aborted it because they did not want the responsibility excuses are like buttholes everyone has one ,0
937,no child deserves to die can feel or can t feel brought through force and pain or not all deserve to live ,0
938,keep comments shorter and to the point ,0
939,i will let my opponent start with his her arguements ,0
940,i only hope she says something in the next round  ,1
942,that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not . the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply . a reasonable person would say the tortfeasor must at least wait a few months until they can be separated . please note most sane commentators to this debate say i am giving myself too much discretion that it is not fair for that reason . so for this debate you must accept that a woman should be able to abort a week before her due date even if she does not have a commonly thought of exception like rape or mothers health ,0
943,if pro is trying to argue that the definition does not or should not mean what people think it does then his argument would still be irrelevant . my opponent has either badly misinterpreted the term pro life or is simply trying to affirm that pro life does not or should not mean what people think it does . the level of disingenuousness of those that make these claims can only be judged by how they define pro life not how pro defines it ,0
944,they can easily give up the baby for adoption instead of doing abortion . if they did not want the child they do not need too do abortion . it does not matter if it does not feel pain ,0
945,come on accept my challenge ,0
946,even though these points say abortion is not as horrible as it could be if it put women in danger it is still basically killing people which pro apparently agrees with since they did not counter either of my points on fetal personhood and bodily autonomy . i assume pro would counter that fetuses do not have moral value but they have done a pretty bad job of defending that by ignoring the point altogether . i guess i win this point by default since pro did not even try to counter me . if pro is going to start making excuses like then what about dead people .  akmath has also moved the goalposts of this debate though i must admit i got caught up in it a bit as well focusing a lot on when life begins and the viability of fetuses rather than the issue at hand whether legalized abortion has done more good than harm ,1
947, not unless there is a breakthrough in modern technology and you are able too .  this means you will never give birth .  congrats you win free control over every womans body . about the size of a one year old .  are you a woman ,1
948,abortions because psychological damage a  review study showed that young woman who go abortion increase risk for depression . abortion is the killing of a human being which defies god . the killing of an innocent human is wrong even if the human has not been born ,0
949,I am afraid i do not understand what my opponent wanted to communicate in the last round apart from the ad hominem remarks ,1
950,you might want to look more closely at my arguments before the next round .  many women could be in higher education or are really working hard for a promotion . second of all this argument has nothing to do with abortions past the first trimester . however even if this is not the case if the woman does not tell her partner about her pregnancy as soon as possible she is selfish . it is important to consider this especially since grammar is an important indicator of who wins debates on most websites including this one ,0
951, note for voters if you already read and understand my first arguments completely then skip these next paragraphs if a mothers life can be saved because the fetus is draining her of too many nutrients inducing labor or removing the fetus would also because the fetus to die just as in abortion so you have contradictory points there . the fetus is not a child yet abortion is not killing a child because the child is self reliant in respect to absorbing nutrients necessary for growth and development while the fetus is not . as long as the fetus is relying on the mother for nutrients to grow and develop for birth the fetus cannot be removed safely from the protection of the mothers body without dying so there is no way for this to happen . just because you are offended at the mother getting an abortion or you do not agree with her getting an abortion does not mean you can outlaw it or that you are right . if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy would exist because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy ,1
952,he does not refute any of my points so we must conclude that he concedes all of them ,1
953,i do not agree that a fetus has to pass some sort of milestone marker in order to gain value in this world because that would mean the fetus value depends on its ability to feel which is not at all a very scientific or ethical way to determine value . we do agree on the fact that a newborn baby has the same value as an adult . but where you say that the line should be drawn when the fetus attains the same amount of value as a fully developed being I would like to raise the argument that a newly conceived fetus has the same amount of value as an adult human being thus disagreeing with your first sentence . so what I have gleaned from your stance is that you think abortions should be legal as long as the fetus is not caused pain . it sounds like value and what that includes determines the weight on the scales of a mothers desires vs ,1
954,but if i told you that same intersection has had ten fatal car crashes any sane person would want a stop sign put up . think about it this way if i told you that an intersection without a stop sign has only experienced one fatal car crash in it is history you would not think anything of it .  your right ones right to live should not be restricted unless justified and i do not think abortion justifies it ,0
955,most abortions saying that something is true because the majority believes it is the bandwagon fallacy ,0
956, a fetus can feel even though it may not be fully formed a fetus in the second trimester is still able to feel pain  as unbelievable as this may sound your hard earned taxes go toward keeping abortion clinics running ,0
957,let the record show that my opponant is using the bandwagon fallacy again ,0
958,the moral question remains though as a private problem for the woman and these sorts of private moral dilemmas are the province of religion . she may see it as her duty to protect it despite the obvious disadvantages to her personal circumstances and she may choose against abortion for those reasons . if the woman is christian she may see her foetus as a living child ,0
959,the same study found that women unable to obtain abortions were more likely to stay in a relationship with an abusive partner than women who had an abortion and were more than twice as likely to become victims of domestic violence . a university of california at san francisco study found that women who were turned away from abortion clinics because they had passed the gestational limit imposed by the clinic were three times more likely to be below the poverty level two years later than women who were able to obtain abortions . according to a study co written by freakonomics co author steven d levitt phd and published in the peer reviewed quarterly journal of economics .   john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that .  it is for the reasons that i have stated above and in my previous speech that i would encourage a vote against the resolution . in addition to the whole thing many women particularly teens are shunned and shamed for their pregnancies not only by friends families employers and classmates but also by advertisements in the subway . giving birth is dangerous too in the united states pregnancy complications are the sixth most common because of death for women between the ages of  and  . thank you for your rebuttals evangelistic omega and i applaud you on staying away from my strengths in the art of debating and identifying them before the debate . because and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion . i will now first like to defeat any religious arguments on this debate with this fact although the catholic and lutheran churches oppose abortion more of their members believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases versus illegal in all or most cases  vs .  susan a cohen s risk of mental health problems turnaway study ansirh org accessed april. in short there are a lot of reasons a woman might seek an abortion . i look forward to my opponents rebuttals and speech in the next round ,1
960,you are not doctor house ,1
961,he then argues that a fetus is still an organism but i showed to him that we kill and eat organisms everyday many times for trivial reasons . sure having an egg and a sperm together is a step closer to having a fetus which leads to having a baby but does this exclude the notion of masturbation . finally he argues that a fetus will eventually become a human but he has failed one of my earlier points about masturbation which i have brought up again . it can be made implicit in my opponents argument that killing a fetus will remove it is possible future experiences as a human . masturbation still has some of the prerequisites for a human being just not as much as a fetus ,1
962,well yes a womens body is hers and she should have the right to decide yes ,0
963,abortion is one of these hard topics to discuss but being the controversial person i am i will take you on . I will give you some examples why it should for example let us say someone was raped and they did not want a baby but now they are pregnant . another example would be if the condom split during the act ,1
964,my opponent argues that a woman should be allowed to change her mind when it comes to having a child well she can change her but she can not just kill a child so she does not have raise it . but the line must me drawn in the sand when it comes to those who made their choice by having sex and got pregnant . abortion should not be legal to those who had consensual sex with a man and happened to get pregnant ,0
965,abortion is taking the life of an innocent why is it right that we choose to call killing someone on the street a crime but killing a child that has not been born is acceptable ,0
966,i hope that you will reconsider your standpoint for anyone that believes it is okay thank you for a good debate and please vote for the negative . i would also like to point out that my opponent has not actually made a case for abortion but merely stated that abortion is better . the real premise that all my arguments come down to is a living being is not anything else while it is in development ,0
967,therefore my opponents arguments that consciousness or at least potential consciousness allows human beings to be killed are exposed to not stand up to scrutiny or at least they do not justify abortion . my opponent also says that comatose patients have been conscious before but aside from this not having any clear relevance it is not always the case . however we do not criminalise acts purely on the basis of societys self interest we criminalise on the basis of what is moral to do . i agree that there is no instrumental purpose to the foetuss life but if we judge ones right to life on instrumental value then we would be justified on killing the dying elderly without their consent . the negation of an incoherent conclusion must be true so the maxim do not kill others must be true . my opponent states that stealing is detrimental to society where abortion is not and so the former ought to be illegal and the latter legal . the utilitarian and deontological theories are enough support of the premise that the killing of human beings apart from self defence is immoral . my opponent asks a legitimate question why should we be consistent in our moral assertions . as my opponent shares my conceptual objection to evolutionary ethics i will not waste my character count defending an ethical theory i do not even support . anencephaly is similar to someone who has had his head shot by a rifle the person will die and has no brain activity but we would not be justified in actively killing this person the most ethical because of action is to let them die naturally as they will . i congratulate him though as i rarely meet someone who defends abortion as well as he does . if we also allow anything that is not detrimental to society then there would be no reason why an abortion is justified and the murder of a  month old baby living on taxpayers money is not so long as both deaths are painless . one could argue that if a foetus is unwanted then its life will not be happy but this is a gross assumption considering that many people who have been unwanted as infants have gone on to live happy lives . just to say though there is a difference between keeping an anencephalic foetus alive and actively dismembering poisoning it as is the case in abortion . in a similar way we are not justified in killing anencephallic foetuses but we ought to let them die naturally instead ,0
968,how can you want to snuff out an innocent life yet want to let an evil person that has proved to society that they are willing to kill others live out his life . i went through profiles of people i disagreed  or more on and most of them were liberal in favor of abortion and against the death penalty . only in favor of killing those that can not defend themselves and opposed to killing people that would murder others ,0
969,a person that is murdered in cold blood does not suck nutrients from a host nor does could he because internal bleeding because severe damage to her vagina and potentially death . a woman that is raped suffers severe psychological damage that potentially never goes away . kinsey  p  reports one record of a seven month old infant and records of five infants under one year who were observed to masturbate ,1
970,that is your belief that is not strongly supported by science . i do not believe it is to abort in the earliest terms of pregnancy at all . that being said religious text does not apply when it comes to the legal argument that an embryo or fetus has rights ,1
971,since this would clearly not be to our benefit the importance of potential must not be very big . for example the  legalization of abortion in south africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion related complications with abortion related deaths dropping by more than  . the legal status of abortion is believed to play a major role in the frequency of unsafe abortion ,1
972,you just admitted that the embryo is a child and therefore is human . so why is it okay for the child to be killed when he she is still in the mothers womb but it is not okay when the child is five . as a human it is guaranteed the right to live ,0
973,there might be exceptions that are okay like rape or to save the mom but they are in the far minority so on balance it is better to put abortion in the wrong category . later term there is no question you are killing a baby . even if it was not a person it is still harming ones self and a living entity that is of human nature ,0
975,healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother or trivial reasons when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed .  to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do . in cases where mother wants abortion or to be free from the baby but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted ,0
977,you are misinformed about the particularities of demonology ,1
978,as for my opponents sole argument i agree that the fetus belongs just as much to the father as it does to the mother . my stance as con so far rests simply on the logic that as a fetus no rights exist for the unborn child . as such the mothers body does not belong to the father and therefore the father has no jurisdiction over what the mother subjects her body to ,1
979,adult stem cellsonce again this argument comes back to if the unborn are living so i end this argument since it is not central to the question at hand whether abortion is ok but rather it is a result because if abortion is ok then fetal stem cells are fine to use . i would like to ask how not giving the death penalty to them is a punishment and is terminating their life a reward . firstly i never said the only question is if unborn fetuses are human but rather i said and i explained why this is true . this just proves murder is illegal which i think we both agree is good that it is illegal but this does nothing to the central question if the unborn are living humans . according to this logic a three year old would not be living either since it also can not reproduce . however if abortion is not ok then fetal stem cells are not fine to use . however i doubt anyone thinks a three year old is not living . so if overpopulation makes abortion ok then with the same reasoning it would make genocide ok . i did not include maternal health or protection of the innocent because we agreed on those points ,0
980,but it is irrelevant in this debate i just thought id throw that information in to this debate to prevent my opponent from using an logical fallacy technique against me . now my opponent has not really given me much to debate on so i will try and infer what my opponent is trying to portray and points that they are trying to convey and then debate off of those . it is impossible to for sure say when human life begins that is a religious question and the beginning of human life cannot be proven . well believe it or not your opinion is not the only opinion and just because you think something is wrong does not mean that it should be outlawed .  i am not doubting certain statements rather i am emphasizing the point that my opponent provided no source to validate his statements . i may think that sport cars should be outlawed because they are dangerous and i do not like them .  now one may reply saying that to end a pregnancy you must a humans life ,1
981,i want to move on to the general topic of abortion ,0
982,where did these morals come from and why should i trust morals that say one form of killing is justified while another is not . the point of my first argument is that very little harm is truly being done .  implies a certain amount of self awareness or a taking away of something one is aware they once had . this is actually quite common in the animal kingdom if a mother or father cannot properly care for their young they will kill all or the weakest of them . you agree that other forms of human killing may be justified so why can not abortion be included . it is important to use correct definitions in a debate and i feel that you used the word when you should have used . do you believe it is moral to bring a child into an environment in which they will not be stable nurtured or cared for ,1
983,again and finally i affirm that the federal government legally defines an embryo at any stage of development as a person with rights equal to the mother and in order to achieve better consistency in you s law abortion laws should recognize this definition as well and adjust accordingly . rather it shows that while pro can only give us an opinion i can provide hard evidence that people actually do not have the right to stop saving someone after consenting to start . i hope the desperation is now obvious pro is having to reach for gods aliens and hypothetical evolutionary mutations in order to rebut my argument . pro says that since abortion is already legal it should remain legal in the name of consistency .  year old pro spent a lot of energy here just to avoid answering the question . the argument is that you would make your decision based on various criteria such as self awareness intelligence ability to feel pain . I will address each of pros rebuttals  i cannot be begging the question since i gave clear reasons for why my premise should be accepted . this is the definition of a straw man building up and attacking an argument pro wishes i made but never actually did . yet when we weigh the logical and scientific evidence we find that the uvaa definition of human life is a good one and therefore it would be more reasonable to uphold uvaa and change the abortion laws . the point is that the uvaa defines an embryo as human life with protected rights and roe v wade allows the destruction of that life . personhood here pro finally gets around to attacking my claim that a genetically complete homo sapien is a person . look carefully at what pro wrote con wrongly asserts that my argument here is based on who you think is a person . pro continually uses this tactic of attacking claims i never made throughout this debate and it has fallen short once again . reducto argument for their rebuttal pro lashes out against the premise that abortion is murder and accuses me with either con agrees abortion is murder is a false premise or con still wants to leave open the option that abortion is murder . pro did not dispute my claim that multiple factors other than personhood can influence this choice and so i consider this argument dropped . pro merely said but did not explain or give reason as to why . as such pros violinist argument does not apply and is refuted .  it is not speciesism I am talking about homo sapien dna not dna specific to certain races or cultures . the cpr example and common sense proves that is not true ,0
984,so unless the womans right to not be pregnant makes it permissible to kill the fetus then we have no reason to accept this . after all i do not see how it would be acceptable to kill a born person who suffers from the same thing as the fetus in your example simply because they are a burden on society . my second objection briefly is that you are not responsible for the violinist you are attached to . he says that when a woman is forced to give birth the she loses utility but does not actually touch on how the mother losing utility because of her actions means she can abort to alleviate herself of her responsibility . after all an abortion is not successful unless it results in the death of the fetus so from all of this we can conclude that abortion is intrinsically geared towards ending the fetus life in order to end the pregnancy .  yes the main goal of an abortion is ultimately to end the pregnancy but the fetus death is the only way to do this . however for the sake of colloquial leniency i am just going to assume that my opponent means that a woman should be allowed to control who uses her body to survive how long someone uses her body to survive and when someone uses her body to survive . in abortion the act in and of itself is meant to kill the fetus so that the pregnancy ends . i do not see how the are analogous so that abortion could be seen as acceptable . as for cases of rape the violinist example is a better defense of abortion in this case because two people did not engage in voluntary sexual intercourse and would therefore not be jointly responsible for the fetus or violinist they are attached to . while i doubt whether or not this example is realistic i think that it would not be so common and this would be one of the times where abortion may be acceptable . if this is taken in the most literal sense then my opponent is flat out wrong . in abortion the goal is to end the pregnancy by killing the fetus . if my opponent agrees that some restrictions should be set forth then we can reject this claim . therefore I will be doing the same thing as my opponent just arguing in a semi formal prose manner ,0
985,my original point was alluding to the fact that a mother should have the right to choose what she does with her own body at least until the fetus has developed the capacity to feel pain or know it exists . any fertile man and woman have the potential to create a child . this implies that woman who are raped should be forced into having their child and reliving the trauma that caused the child to exist every day . at this point the fetus is essentially a growth . is a child that grows up to be a miserable drug addict worth more than someone who has a happy life even if it is already half over . however one must take into consideration the quality of that life . my opponent states that the only reason abortion should be allowed is in the case of severely disabled children . when any population reaches carrying capacity it does so by first exceeding it is capacity until natural forces such as disease hunger poverty and general bad quality of life kill of the excess . when i pointed out that someone who cannot make decisions for themselves like a child or someone in a vegetative state the right to make their decisions is then given to their next of kin ,1
986,my post was designed to lead pro abortionists in to an inescapable conclusion namely that abortion is indeed the homicide of a human being or at the least to concede that their position is illogical . but specifically i wanted to ask the question why it only becomes murder when the mother wants the child . as best i can tell you are not the right person to be debating because you and i are actually in agreement ,1
987,and I am not saying that any loving and caring mother out there would not die for their children but here maybe the fetus is only  weeks old can this technically be called a baby . i am not saying that the disabled and handicapped cannot live a life but serious cases whereby the child would not have any sort of fulfilled life then i feel it is more human to let that child rest before any pain is felt at all . i am not saying that we can predict the future but i also think that if a child is going to seriously suffer in life because of uncontroble things then it is less cruel to terminate it . what i mean is if the child is going to be born and live for a week because its got this illness which is not curable is not it more cruel to make it live for that week of pain rather than having to go through the obvious emotional distress of an abortion . yes i adoption is a choice and I am not saying that adopted children are not happy but there is always going to be something missing in their life some questions that cannot be answered like which could eat a child inside out ,1
989,she has no legitimate claims to abort the baby if it can just be removed given her hindrance is not really an issue . in any case ask anyone if they would rather be born into rough conditions or die and you see it is clear we should give preference to letting it live . you seem to think the birth canal is the magical point but it is a lot more arbitrary because for effective purposes the baby can survive and all you are providing is trivial location points ,0
990,these opinion polls are misleading as they force respondents to choose between an outright ban and no control at all it is impossible for them to register support for partial birth abortion in cases where the mother s physical or psychological health is in danger . more importantly this should not be the business of the general public or of legislators . nobody who would prefer not to have a partial birth abortion will be made to have one ,1
991,i thank my opponent for posting his argument on this topic as i mentioned earlier my stance will revolve around why it is justified for a woman to willingly want to abort during pregnancy i will state my facts below and i will then leave it to con to respond accordingly ,1
992,the sanctity of life is the idea that god gave life to the human race especially christians and so to take away life before natural causes including disease is to be playing god which is blasphemy and condemns the perpetrator to hell .  gods divine plan does not conform to the idea of free will  it takes away the uniqueness that god bestowed upon humanity when he created the human race  it is considered to be murder and commandment  says that . secondly god is supposedly a power above humanity and the things he does he does for a reason . point  links on to this really very nicely too the idea that god created us in his own image let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth . the bible does indeed state that god has a divine plan but it also says that god gave humans free will to a great extent we can determine our future . christians are offended by the idea that abortion is legal how humanity created by god has fallen to such a low level . christians are opposed to abortion because of the following reasons  it breaks the sanctity of life the idea that god gave us life and so only he can take it and for a human to do that is playing god . why would anyone create anything better than something else yet have that same thing bound by its own will which makes it the same as the things it was supposed to be different from . abortion is appalling in this way as it refutes the idea that humanity is unique and special and that we have a right given by god to live . as you can see god gave us free will free will to follow his commands but in the way that does not make life meaningless and controlled but rather in a way that allows us to make our own informed decisions or else jesus would not have had to pay for our sins the bible would be a useless tool as we would do whatever god wanted and thus we have free will . murder one of the ten commandments written by god and dictated to his creation in the knowledge that believers would adhere to such things ,0
993,my job as creator of this debate is to prove that prochoice is proabortion ,1
994,just because the woman is no longer pregnant does not mean they are not a mother of a child but now the are the mother of a dead child . it may be their body but now they are sharing it with a whole other human life form . the definition of murder is the killing of one human being by another . every baby is a gift and a blessing this gift should not be returned . the baby may feel no pain and after they will never feel anything ,0
995, as clinton wilcox a ddo member keytar hero writes on his blog human beings are uniquely valuable based on the kind of thing they are humans that is members of species homo sapiens . although his argument will be responded to i would ask voters to put more of a weight on moral arguments in this case his first trimester point and my case will be mainly ethics . one famous abortionist who works in my town side note his wife is being sued because one of her abortion patients died has admitted all late and second trimester abortions will likely experience one complication . and instead of giving a personal experience with a child that was like this i will give an empirical point as personal stories are not always  accurate many parents have aborted their babies because doctors told them that their children would be severely handicapped . if the right to life is proven as i will prove in my case rape should be no exception to abortion . my opponent under contraception has essentially argued killing a human is moral because a woman has made careless mistakes  . the amount of parents owning an adopted child was cut in half after roe v wade not because of parents not wanting children but there not being enough children . my opponents second point arguing a fetus is not developed enough to be a person but is a human shall also be refuted in my case . war should only be perused if there is no other option my opponents analogy actually proves my point that abortion should be a restricted procedure . this argument will be refuted in my case . the largest most credible studies have shows  of women with an abortion have post abortion syndrome . i would like to first note the majority of his argument is irrelevant it argues for the practicality of abortion not the ethics . abortion kills a human being as naral an abortion advocacy group admits there is simply no doubt that even the early embryo is a human being . as to being there is no doubt that it exists is alive is self directed and is not the same being as the mother and is therefore a unified whole . we are the only beings that we know of that are inherently rational agents killing such a life form would be immoral and therefore wrong . the burden of proof must always be on the one wishing to take human life . further the roe v wade court case was not founded on the constitution they merely assumed it a  amendment right which is debateable ,0
996,my opponents argument he relies simply on the fact that since a law exists in favor for anti abortion a way that it can be interpreted at least then this serves as an argument . i argue that unless the fetus is a person which is an entity that is rational and possess the adequate mental faculties to introspect then abortion is okay . however do realize that part of the punishment may be that the parents did not originally want the fetus to die abortion against their consent so i suppose some part of the law may account for that though it will be tricky . finally while i agree that i have a burden it should not be a controversy that my opponent also has a burden to prove a situation in which the act of abortion is wrong . if he does succesfully then he does indeed show abortion to be murder and thus to be wrong .  the right of a fetus killing a pregnant woman quote if you kill a pregnant woman you are charged with two murders . well even if that is so this is no argument . however i will attack his premise that a late term fetus for the sake of clarity will just be known as a fetus is a human being . it had a beating heart functioning brain skeletal respiratory digestive and other bodily systems ,1
997,i believe that is all i have to say i would say that it was a pleasure debating with you but the fact that you continuously kept clinging onto the part about life even when there are people out there dying in war dying from murder dying from fire accidents dying from medical causes well i hope you get the jist . there is no correct answer where human life begins it is mainly just a blurry line of what people claim . even some children with such supportment including a family that wants them and a house would not be able to get that far . women do not have a to have children and certainly don t assume such a responsibility by virtue of deciding to have sex . adoption still requires women to carry a baby to term and then give birth both of which are also inherently dangerous . this as the argument says clearly shows that human life begins at conception . interesting and quick fact most people reject the position that abortion is always wrong . one of the most common arguments today against being pro choice is the fact that there is a strand of dna in each cell of an embryo . bearing a child alters a womans life more than anything else . many people believe that bringing an unwanted child into the world is a crime and that forcing a woman to have a child against her will is morally wrong . so from your statement there for taking the loss and to move on are implying that having a child is a loss . many who are opposed to abortion for religious or moral reasons believe that it is wrong to impose their values by civil law on everyone . also to answer your question i believe that the woman has the choice to decide whether to undergo abortion within the first  months ,1
998,do you kill an egg to make an omelet ,1
999,therefore they are not identical ,1
1000,but we are not dealing with a single death out of  conceptions we are dealing with  deaths compared to  live births for each  conceptions . con does not take into account the obvious fact that the dna could be a self writing program or a set of blueprints with hidden details . if is a self writing program and dna is simply the tablet upon which life writes then the first instance of dna may not contain the entire code of the human being . for those reasons alone it is clear that cons arguments that it is life at conception and that the life that is there is human life and not human tissue cannot be true . so we truly are speaking of when we speak of conceptions embryos fetuses or anything until there is an actual living human baby . we know that the material that is in the dna existed before conception and is a mixture of dna of the parents . we can say with confidence that if the dna is so flawed that a non human species would be the result that species would not be born but naturally aborted . i think we have met the concerns of con as it relates to whether or not we know for certain that any one specific unborn zef is or is not a human . so we have proven that it is impossible to know if a child will be born until the there are no genetic flaws and a birth occurs . first and foremost it assumes that the dna is a total package that mediates and creates a completely new human life by some unstated method . at this stage of scientific knowledge no person can say they understand what it is about dna and life that make the two linked . we know that the dna at conception is subjected to complex processes we do not fully understand and over which generates a more fully divergent offspring . therefore it is impossible to know if a conception will become a human life until the code is completely run and there is a live birth . con admits that humans are born of humans and that there is no reason to believe that will not always be the case . now if a person is honest he can see that even if one birth out of  was known to die then those  initial conceptions are in fact humans not real humans . no person knows the mechanisms that operate in the reading of the blueprint or code that drives the dna to divide in meiosis and replicate in mitoses . of all conceptions as many as  die within the first two weeks another  of the remaining conceptions die in the next  to  weeks and of those remaining another  percent die between week  and  and of the those living to the second trimester another  percent die and finally in the third trimester another  percent die ,1
1001,why do you consider the fetus to be human ,1
1002,let us look at the effects of an imbalanced sex ratio  reduction in poverty the government has illegalized ssa because it anticipates a skewed sex ratio . if ssa is legalized couples will have no reason to discriminate on the basis of gender the girl child will be more likely to receive proper attention . there will be a change in culture i anticipate an improvement in the status of women .  the government of india anticipating a catastrophe in the form of severe imbalance in the male female ratio has passed an act to prevent sex selective abortion . let us look at some of the reasons for legalizing sex selective abortion  safeguarding the health of women even though it is illegal sex selective abortion is still widely practiced .  ethical perspective if a couple feels that its evolutionary interests can best be handled by a specific gender they have a right to choose which gender they want to raise irrespective of the scientific logical validity of their decision . this is because the couple will be investing significant resources in the upbringing of their child time money etc ,1
1003,the fetus has a heartbeat at  weeks old and according to the website abortion facts the fetus can feel the physical pain of being aborted ,0
1004,i was saying they are like nazis only for the abortion holocaust comparision ,0
1005,I am pretty sure when god created me he made a mistake i mean i did die during birth and was resuscitated by the doctors at the hospital ,1
1006, and  you still call them selfish because many of them are in the second and third trimester according to your own arguement . once the fetus starts to develop then the signature bulge will start to show but by that time they could be in the second trimester  again women do not always find out they are pregnant immediatley at the first trimester . before i rebutt my opponents claims i would like to address something he saidfirst of all you should add periods at the end of your sentences ,1
1007,there are some things that are beyond the purview of any government ,1
1008,the biologist will tell you that a frog is a frog from the instant it first functions as an independent organism regardless of the form it takes during the course of its development . it would be like declaring the benchmark of life for the butterfly organism is the presence of wings and antennae and then after examining the caterpillar pronouncing that because it has neither wings nor antennae it is neither living nor a butterfly despite the fact that it is a living organism with the genome of the butterfly and if it is not killed before it completes its metamorphosis will become nothing other than a butterfly . an organism is never identified purely on the basis of its morphological or physiological state at any given point in its lifecycle . human being my opponent has consented in his last speech that if i prove a fetus to be a human being then my claims are legitimate . the biologist will not hesitate to affirm that the tadpole is indeed a frog . well it depends upon how you define the frog organism . may we identify an organism as a frog purely on the basis of its morphology physical form ,0
1009,if pro had in fact read my argument he would have seen that i said that a fetus was a ball of cells up to a certain point . this still however does not qualify as a human being . furthermore pointing out arguments i could have made is not advancing the debate it is in fact helping me ,1
1011,now the only way i can state that this type of murder is absolutely wrong immoral and unethical is to state that the bible claims murder should not be done .  harm implies a certain amount of self awareness or a taking away of something one is aware they once had . do you believe it is moral to bring a child into an environment in which they will not be stable nurtured or cared for .  the point of my first argument is that very little harm is truly being done . you yourself cannot give any justification of why abortion should be allowed therefore it is not right to continue abortion because it is indeed murder . physically we are made of the same things but otherwise humans and animals are totally different . my point in the first statement was that it does not matter in either case they are both an individual human . this is actually quite common in the animal kingdom if a mother or father cannot properly care for their young they will kill all or the weakest of them . abortion is legal because the government has shied away from the definition of a human life . even if you say there is no harm done in this logic there is nothing wrong with killing a person in a coma . how does abortion fit into the unethical side . intent to inflict grievous bodily harm short of death iii . if you cannot care for a child you can choose the following  not to have sex  prevent fertilization  adoption .  this is murder by the law and abortion if the embryo is a human falls under this category . but the choice is not instead of letting the person die we kill the person ,0
1012,objection number  would work if i caused damage to someone and because of that damage that person needed a bone marrow transplant then he would have the right to take my bone marrow without my permission however this is not the case with abortion the mother caused no damage to the fetus in fact she did just the opposite she brought the fetus into a state of being from non existence . however for the sake of an interesting debate i will concede this contention and agree with my opponent that an embryo as well as a fetus is a complete full fledged person with  human rights . the doctor had causality of dependence on his patient yet he is still not obligated to donate his bone marrow . abortion cuts up little babies it does not just take them out of the womb to sever the nutrients from the mother . i will concede the point that these forms of abortions are wrong . therefore objection  does not give the fetus the right to forcibly take nutrients from the mothers body without the permission of the mother anymore than the patient has the right to forcibly take nutrients from the doctor in the case listed above . likewise the doctor did not have damage on his hands and therefore he is exempt from giving up his bone marrow to his patient . if i needed a bone marrow transplant and only one other person on the entire planet had a perfect bone marrow match and i needed her bone marrow to save my life do i have the right to forcibly take her bone marrow . if a doctor performs an operation that saves a persons life and because of that operation the person will need a bone marrow transplant in  years can the patient now force the doctor to give up his bone marrow without the doctors permission ,1
1013,jones is told they have to do an abortion . if it is in the womb you are right it can not sustain itself but that does not mean it is not human . not having sex or using a condom means that no baby fetus is even created so none is being killed . but when they are born and can still not do anything then it is basically the same as being stillborn . if you are not born yet why should you be killed ,0
1014,i respect your opinion as we are all entitled to one and i appreciate that you have respect for mine as well but either way i would appreciate if you would make a longer and more solid argument in the next round as the closing argument will be the last chance you have to make all of your points . yes i see your point on the matter however the problem is the fact that if the mother gets pregnant and the risk of dying in child birth exists than why should the mother put her life on the line for a child she does not even want at times which is feeding off of her body and may possibly have to grow up with conditions that would hinder it from ever entering society yes i perfectly open to admitting that abortion is murder because it has been observed that the fetus is in essence alive due to the fact that at proper conception nuclear fusion occurs and makes new cells however those cells are not necessarily capable of coherent thought thus the only thing that you are killing are a group of cells that currently are residing inside the mothers womb those cells which in essence are the same kind of cells we kill on a daily basis when we wash the floor or clean the dishes or clean the bathroom or anything we are trying to get clean almost always involves the murder of cells and or bacteria we just feel different about the cells residing inside the mothers womb because they will grow into a human in later development which is fair understandable but the child those collection of cells will grow into could develop horrible mutations in its genes or will have copying errors in its dna due to the lack of genetic diversity in the case of incest .  or may die because the mother did as well in childbirth and even then would have to suffer social issues later in its life because their parent will have either died in childbirth or would have to live in an adoption agency that has bare minimum standards for the children it cares for ,1
1015,my arguments and thoughts remain as presented above ,1
1016,i will debate that abortion is not a violation of human rights ,1
1017,in order to justify killing innocents con attempts to bring up that people should be able to choose what is moral for them and bodily autonomy however killing a human deprives them of the choice to be happy flo and violates the bodily autonomy of the fetus . introduction refutations tbrs main argument goes as such  the government should not try to impose morality onto people but should instead let them decide  banning abortion imposes morality onto women . allowing a person to make a choice in keeping with her moral and not subjected by anothers is socials balanced morals .  this logic is false because the governments job is to find the best system of morality and use it in laws . allowing a woman to make a choice in keeping with her moral and not subjected by anothers is socials balanced morals . this argument turns to pro because the fetus is the one with bodily autonomy being violated . by tbrs logic we should have a system of popular sovereignty in which we can choose to own slaves ,0
1018,my argument is and has been this if we as a society are to weigh the value of life to all persons in making decisions then we must also consider the value of the life of the possible person inside the mothers womb .  at the end of her comments dairygirl reminds us any differences of opinion we might have it seems would be an inherent value judgment call and tehres not much more to discuss .  i think it is reasonable to think reasonably disputed life can be valued less than the freedom to choose .  i also think incidentally that you could be personally against abortion but allow people to decide for themselves but only if you do not think it is certainly a person and are using the freedom issue . am i understanding you simply put i believe dairygirls belief in early abortions to be reasonable for a person to hold who has not examined the full rationality of the situation .  and none of these statements in any way provide justification for the implied assumption of her claim right to choose abortion value of life to society now it can be argued that i have given no justification for my argument that value of life infinite however this is irrelivent . consequently these are the closing remarks so i shall mostly restate my argument attempt to answer  concerns and to demonstrate that although this debate missed round  for reasons of the holidary it should be inconsequential to the debate results because of the weaknesses inherent in dairygirls arguments .  i acknowledge the society can have a say but I am simply saying if it says the laws are arbortion friendly it is rational not that it is analogous completely to areas where it can obviously exist .  liberty value of life a very specific choice therefore in two rounds of debate dairygirl has presented no substantiation for her claims that a government can rationally legalize abortion ,0
1019,that is the thing its not only with our own selves you are also affecting a life that would have been born except you stopped that from happening ,0
1020,pro forfeited the entire debate ,0
1021,or if you are ashamed you can go to a hospital or clinic and give the baby to them preventing harm . if the girl got pregnant during highschool that was her decision and she should deal with the consequences and if she or the father do not have enough money to support the baby adoption is again the option . it has been proven that if in fact a woman gets an abortion it raises her risks of infertility ,0
1022, it is not necessarily a punishment it is the its just simply what happens when you have sex if she does not want a child she should not have sex period . i have already told you that if she does not want the thing she can just give it up for adoption but apparently do not think that is a viable option . and then you say that it is not fair for the child to be put in a home where a mother does not want it this is funny so by that logic you are saying that it is fair that we kill it ,0
1023,i know there is a lot of people out there who disagree with this so the invitation for this debate will be open to anyone ,0
1024,the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy done in the late stages of pregnancy . moral of pertaining to or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong ethical moral attitudes . as my opponent is affirmative the burden of proof lies on him her ,0
1025,she still assumed the risk of pregnancy and there is soemthing to be said about her lack of periods and keeping in tune with what is going on .  recgonizing not all woman have periods due to birth control etc so are you suggesting a woman with no traditinoal exception like health should be able to abort her child a week before her due date just because she wants to . you were just trying to poke holes in something ,0
1026,i also agree that anti abortionists do not necessarily hate women . there should not be any abortions after this point about   weeks in . so let us say no abortions after  weeks like the definition says . i think that kind of answered all three questions . I am not as much against the people who just think abortion should be illegal as i am against these ,1
1027,as the pregnancy continues she assumes the issue more and more by not abortin when it is at least morally grayer . i can understand if con thinks I am less persuative but my impression is that he is acting as if there is something more quantitative that I am missing . no sane person would argue that the wrong doer should be able to kill the victim . i do not see how con thinks the best interpretation is his guidelines because it is just contrary to good sensibilities of interptation and application . he did not address my assumption of the risk point at least directly .  claim coming from the pro is that there is no way to easily identify person hood . i suppose we could take these standards being argued by myself and con as blurry . plus if i were to want to get technical and play dirty it is not like burglars are without rights . with sex the woman must understand that she is causing a sitaution where someone at least a putative someone will become dependant upon her for actions that she took . perhaps this is sufficient for a secular mindset to not grant rights to that person but there is no necessary moral reasons we coud nt go further back . he can disagree but he seems to be acting as if there is more I am not addressing that i in fact am addressing ,0
1028,like cells in someones hair or fingernails an egg or sperm does not have the capacity to become other than what it already is . a sperm has  chromosomes and no matter what even though it is alive and can fertilize an egg it can never make another sperm . at what minute can one consider life to be worthless and at the next minute that life to be precious . this new life is not a sperm or an egg or even a simple combination of both . from the time those  chromosomes become  onward the unborn is a living developing individual with a unique genetic makeup . yet medical research proves that the fetus is a living organism from the moment of conception . once there is the union of a sperm and egg the  chromosomes are brought together in one cell with  chromosomes . it is not a human life or some type of life because something non human does not magically become human by getting older and bigger whatever is human must be human from the beginning . both are essentially dead ends destined to remain what they are until they die in a matter of days ,0
1029, of abortions are in the first trimester so why should we completely outlaw it when the fetus is completely dependent on the mother in the uterus at this time cannot think anything or feel anything on its own .   pregnant teens die each year during childbirth and the babies have a  higher chance of dying as well . they will not be able to feed themselves or their children so why can not they have an abortion . parents who do not allow their kids to have an abortion will make life tougher for their daughter and themselves . and can we all agree that the people making these laws in washington should be a bunch of dumb middle aged white men ,1
1031,for me i feel that if i agreed to let these convicted murders be put to death that would be condoning the exact thing that i find wrong about them . i was not going to accept your challenge at first because in theory i do not actually with your stance in the title of this debate . when i chose as my stance on abortion i meant this in reference to the idea of whether abortion should be legal or not . as you mentioned yours take on life is that it is from conception when a sperm fertilizes egg . beyond the fact that i do not agree with the fundamental idea of it it is not going to be  accurate . however your question is a good one and I would like to at least explain my thought process for the answers to the questions in my profile which is i assume where you found that i with abortion yet with the death penalty for me factors for which i base my decisions surrounding my choice not to support the death penalty are very different from those on which i base my decision to be pro choice . do i with the idea of abortion in general . having the power to kill people for doing the same thing to someone else strikes me as an odd way of teaching a lesson . this for me presents a quandary that i do not feel i need to address to decide my stance on abortion . taking away their right to breathe and live is a whole other step up from taking away their right to be free in society by keeping them in a prison cell for the rest of their life and i do not think that the satisfaction that the families of those murdered feel is enough . when it comes to the death penalty first and foremost it quite simply does not sit well with me . now obviously just because i do not want to kill these people does not mean i want them to be free . probably the biggest reason i am against the death sentence is that i think it is unnecessary ,1
1032,pro states first she concedes that adoption centers are full in the you s and does not contest that this is a viable point against her argument . i was speaking in terms of morality but the scientific question is relevant as well because pro used it as the justification for her position she said in round  . she needed to prove to us that abortion is categorically wrong and has failed to do so .   pro did not provide adequate justification for her point on adoption clinics and why even the mere existence of them would justify imposing this burden on a mother and a family . with my remaining character space i am going to rebuild my contentions  pro never denied that she had the burden of proof . i merely pointed out not only that she had not backed up this point had not proven objective morality and had not established personhood and distinguished it from life .   pro did not address the point i made about a concession on subjective morality meaning that her burden was impossible to fulfill . again pro used an appeal to science in an attempt to justify her position but is not admitting that other people may disagree with her as to when a fetus or a zygote is a . this of course is an appeal to objective morality when she has already conceded that it does not exist and even this point falls flat because committing an act on purpose is not necessarily out of sptie .   pro dropped my point and how the fact that there exist gray areas is an argument for abortion being left to the people most intimately involved instead of legislated by the government . resolution it is wrong to have an abortionthis is the resolution and pro had the entirety of the bop to prove to us that abortion is in all cases categorically wrong ,1
1033,if penetration of the vagina is indeed illegal if the legal age is not reached why then should it be legal for vaginal penetration to occur the other way before that age . as per the title I am presuming my opponent is defending the notion abortion should always be illegal .   before it can feel pain the following article and this implies that up to the development of a foetus cannot feel pain ,1
1034,i have been very clear about what i meant ,1
1035,being pro life is when you care more about than s encrypted  . nih has a great article about the science of it nerve endings examples comparisons at this link that is a big number . for example imagine that pranking your least favorite teacher at school was not allowed but you would not get any punishment or email sent home if you did it . if it is banned after  weeks these people will have to spend a lot of their time and income on having the baby and then are more likely to qualify for programs that help the economically disadvantaged costing the defecit more money . I am sorry to say this but if there is no consequence people will do whatever . teen mothers can be subject to more bullying and do not have as many opportunities either vocational or education or social . i can testify to that with some of my own experiences with orphaned abandoned or surrendered kids . people should not have to give up the freedoms of being their age to take care of a baby they do not want . this increases the number of taxes people have to pay and is economically harder on the nation because taxes will rise ,1
1036,why spend the money to create a law if you have no intention to enforce the law . it would have been nice if she could have explained what she was trying to say . i am unable to decipher what my opponent is saying here ,1
1037,with contraception being so effective unwanted pregnancies are typically a result of irresponsible sexual behavior ,0
1038,i want to point out that this debate specifically is asking whether or not teenage girls who are the victims of rape should have access to abortions . development occurs throughout our lives not solely in the nine months of it that we spend in our mothers wombs . he would then have to pay the medical bills associated with the pregnancy and serve a longer term in jail for making the victim also go through a pregnancy . however the baby itself is an innocent bystander in the crime and it should not be given the death penalty for the rapists actions . if a girl or woman gets pregnant as a result of a rape an additional charge should be added to the rapists charges . also according to maureen condic a neurobiologist at the university of utah the nervous system begins to develop at  weeks and is complete by  weeks . finally it also makes no sense to argue that the baby could not survive without its mother until  weeks as it takes several years of life before one could truly survive on his or her own . how is it our right to determine how developed a person needs to be to qualify as a person . if we accept that abortion is murder and morally wrong then the other question to consider is whether those circumstances are changed by being a teenage girl who was raped ,0
1040,ok i see what your saying that this earth is being over populated but it is still wrong one reason is that we do not own are bodies god does two god has a plan for that child for instants i read this cartoon and this man was looking at god and he asked god why have not you sent someone to cure aids and god said we have so many problems diseases and ect ,0
1041,now that that is out of the way the reason i think rich or middle class women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish is self explanatory . this is not the case for rich or middle class women who almost always have the ability to get the procedure done by the end of the first trimester . this is certainly the case for women who get abortions past their first trimester because by doing this they show a blatant disregard for the well being of the unborn baby they have in their womb ,0
1042,that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not . the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply . if there is no significant health or life or very very significant emotional problems which might include rape but since I am focusing on later term pregnancy the mother is losing her rights in that regard given she did not abort when morally grayer aborting the infant in the womb is no different than aborting it when it is born ,0
1043,if you have any sence of justice or can see past the shockingly biased national media i e rte who my parents still have to pay their taxes to if you want to prevent  children from dieing per day due to abortion amount of children dying everyday from abortions in america if you want to keep ireland as a world leader for care in pregnant women if yo want to prevent full term abortion and euthanasia which i believe will be our next referendum then vote no . even though some women say t mind to have one every time a woman has an abortion it just crushes her self esteem smaller and smaller and smaller . something that i found extremely hateful and wrongful is that  of babies with down syndrome are aborted now talk about ableism . i believe that being pro life goes hand in hand with being pro lgbtq being anti racist as these are all views just letting people live their life because we have no right to decide to undermine persecute or slaughter these humans just because we do not want them there or they re inconvenient for us to have to deal with . the upcoming referendum in ireland to repeal the  amendment is just like giving a blank cheque to our government to do whatever they like to the only thing making ireland an extremely safe place to be pregnant in  ,0
1044,for the purposes of this debate i would like to ask that my opponent begins with these three assumptions  all persons are legitimate self owners  life begins at conception and  all persons have the same rights . just as a landlord may evict a tenant a woman may evict her child from her property in this case from her body . women as self owners have complete dominion over their bodies and insofar as they do not violate the rights of anyone else they may use their bodies as they please ,1
1045,sex is primarily for procreation and is designed to be enjoyed by a man and a woman within the confines and commitment of marriage . a fetus is neither dead nor an insect nor a plant . you embrace the selfish nature of people rather than encouraging individual responsibility for our actions ,0
1046,thus all human life can be said to be inseparable from its personhood and thus needs to be protected as such . embryology tells us that life starts at conception this life by virtue of having two human parents is thus a . my second premise that all human life has an absolute right to life is the more important premise . we have seen in the past in society that when one group of humans denys personhood to another group of humans all sorts of injustices happen . we can further see that since this life is growing and has its only unique dna it is a human organism ,0
1047,it is not murder if a cluster of cells that might develop into a human is being exterminated . also do note that it would likely become another orphan there is not much being done abour orphanage like i stated in round  . it should not be illegal to prevent a teenage girl whom would feel abortion is less of a harm to them than pre mature pregnancy . many teenage girls comply with the fact on abortion and rape victims would rather have one . if developed nations like usa or australlia have the technology for safe abortions and such why should we revert to the ways of undeveloped nations such as india or iraq . while this could possibly be true for some woman remember for many woman avoiding pregnancy especially at a young age would because less damage to them . pro is then implying that a dead person is not treated well and has a history of consciousness . also a sperm does not simply die when it fertilizes an egg it simply merges with it and combines dna . i also mentioned in my arguments on why a history of consciousness is valid to the abortion debate . killing disordered people outside the womb is not equal to aborting them when they are not a developed human being . he then goes on to state that abortion is murder thus making every possible benefit of abortion wrong ,1
1049,and the last reason it should be illegal in principal is because the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy . the common arguments in favor of abortion should be used here as holistic approach to why she should be able to decide given the various moral considerations involved . the pro and con about human life here are enough to say in principle we should defer to human life but not clear enough to make any meaningful punishments for it . but on the other hand the earliest cell does meet the requirements for what would constitute an organism albeit it would probably be viewed as more like a parasitic organism given it must live off of the mother .  aside from rape and mothers health abortion should be illegal in the first trimester but not investigated nor punished . i would take that same reasoning though and argue that it is such a strong consideration that it should at least be illegal albeit with no legal consequences . while the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy she may have tried her best not to get pregnant and got pregnant anyways ,0
1050,i can not think of any more terms which will likely need defining but if i do I will define such terms in my later speeches . I would like to wish my opponent good luck and thank them and the readers for their attention . central nervous system a group of organs mainly the brain and spinal cord which are made primarily of neutrones ,1
1051, los angeles times june   agree  disagree which of these statements comes closer to your opinion abortion is the same thing as murdering a child or abortion is not murder because the fetus really is not a child . we are not debating whether or not abortion should be legal or whether or not the majority of americans would have it banned in any or all circumstances . given four categories to choose from a combined  indicate abortion is murder while  say it is not murder very similar to the gallup s  findings . the morality of abortion asked about the morality of abortion in general americans are evenly divided  told gallup in a may  survey that abortion is morally acceptable while  answered that it is morally wrong . time cnn august   murder  do not feel this way a unique question asked by the center for survey research at the university of virginia explored americans feelings about abortion as murder in greater detail . university of virginia january  murder as bad as killing person already born  murder not as bad as killing a person already born  not murder does involve taking human life  not murder is a surgical procedure for removing human tissue  no opinion  this article shows that the majority of americans believe that abortion is murder . however as can be seen about one fifth of those who consider abortion murder make a distinction between abortion and killing a person who is already born ,0
1052,a woman can be too young not be emotionally prepared not have support by her significant other she can not be economically stable have health problems she could have even been raped etc . their are many reason an individual can have to go through taking the choice of getting an abortion . its not an easy procedure that takes alot of thinking and a woman can encounter many risks but if a woman is going through any of the following options above i belive abortion is the right option to take ,1
1053,woah are you objectifying me ,1
1054,there are many things we can do to make this optional . also as you can see everyone who is pro choice has been born so it is a little hypocritical . just because the baby can support itself and needs the mother to survive doesn t mean she should have the right to kill it .  remember i m talking about situations other than the life of the mother . in this example you are saying we should stop abortion . you say   children die a year . mothers abort so they don t have to deal with the pregnancy or have to deal with the child growing up . you are treating these children like animals saying there are too many so we should have anymore and we should not let them live . besides I am talking about kids doing the drugs and the dad being ok with it just there to look over them . i dons safe or not the baby dies either way . woman doesn t suffer either when they are dealing with a pregnancy as much as being ripped apart . abortion didn t exist back then at least the way we do it . if this is what you re saying people on life support have no human rights either ,0
1055,i think con would agree that a sperm is alive I am excluding the egg since i have yet to understand the workings of the ovary and i do not want to make false assumptions but i am pretty sure it is alive . so does con believe that the birth of a child is not a mutual choice between both man and wife that if a man for some reason wanted many children and raped several women to do so they could not get an abortion . what if the impregnated women are too young to support a child a bad influence or too poor . a sperm can create a human so it must have some human dna . he then went on to state that sperms do not have the potential to be a human or at least by themselves ,1
1056,killing the embryo cannot even be considering murder because the brain or nervous system has not be developed in the early stages and you have already agreed that abortion after rape is acceptable so you must not have any strong feelings on killing embryos at all . i would find it more tragic for a child to be born and then abused than never born at all every single sperm and every single period is a tragic and wasted life by your logic . if she did indeed want to care for the child she would not desperately want the abortion in the first place . i am presuming that the mother will not treat the child nice because she is desperate for an abortion why would anyone who wants an abortion also want to care for the child . I am glad your mum grew stronger from her childhood abuse and that she did not want to be aborted but you miss the point that an aborted embryo would never develop feelings or regrets ,1
1057,of course my opponent would never make these arguments as they are against his conservative ideals which are what dictates his opposition to abortion rather than a genuine concern for life . if this were an argument about the government funding the deaths of children my opponent would also have to argue why death by abortion is worse than death by unmanned aerial vehicle . he would also have to argue why the government does not fund medical care of all children in the united states once they are born ,1
1058,also if wanted childrens lives are being lost during unwanted pregnancies do you think women should become perpetual baby making machines so that the fewest possible number of children will live . you are killing the life of a child already in existence for one that may or may not happen . yet no one would say it is okay to kill a toddler because the mother suddenly does not want them anymore . even in the case of rape as i have indicated this is not a good reason to kill the unborn child as i have already made the case for . there is no reason to expect that if they are aborting their child because of other factors i e job school etc that their situation will drastically change in nine months and they would want to have a child then . here I will quote a couple more human development begins at fertilization the process during which a male gamete or sperm unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to form a single cell called a zygote . but let us recap the resolution that we are debating is . again it is irrelevant that there is no consensus as to when life begins . i confess i have no idea what you were trying to show me with your first link from religious tolerance . the as he calls it would not be to save the life of the wanted fetus because in order to do that the already conceived unwanted fetus must die . please find me an embryologist who is an actual expert in the field who says we can not know when life begins . in fact your entire argument is ridiculous because you are making the case that we are only valuable if we are wanted . however if the girl woman is worried about poverty or any other reason she can always gift the child to a loving couple for adoption which is much better than having the child killed . my position that life begins at fertilization is much more consistent than your position that life begins at birth because birth is an arbitrary event .  keith l moore before we are born essentials of embryology  edition philadelphia pa saunders  . this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual . pro apparently thinks that keeping an unwanted child will always result in not being able to have a wanted child with her lover ,0
1059,abortion allows the people of the society which in this case will be the united states the right to exercise there first amendment right through action ,1
1060,the woman is going to be the one who has to go through labor and take care of the child ,1
1061,abortion is wrong and it should be stopped . it is not the unborn babies fault . god put that baby in their stomach for a reason ,0
1062,additionally many women in the you s are separated but not legally divorced yet from their husbands . for example if a rare genetic disorder was discovered that would create a baby born with a severe physical or mental impairment that was not correctable and would lead to a short depressing lifespan or if a woman life would be seriously endangered by continuing with the pregnancy . in some you s states informed consent laws sometimes called laws require that a woman seeking an elective abortion be given factual information by the abortion provider about her legal rights alternatives to abortion such as adoption available public and private assistance and medical facts . waiting periods generally serve no purpose the fetus continues to develop the longer that a woman waits for an abortion . late term abortions would only be performed in extenuating circumstances such as when the physical health of the woman is placed in severe jeopardy . other developed countries including canada have no legal restrictions on abortion and have far lower abortion rates than countries that place legal restrictions on the procedure namely the you s and countries in south america . if parents are allowed to influence their daughters decisions the daughter may resort to dangerous risky means in order to obtain an abortion ,1
1063,the free will is what makes a human a human we are not bound by mere instinct we are dynamic and capable of a higher level of thought . even if they do go to heaven the biggest issues christians have with abortion is that it is murder and to murder is to break one of the ten commandments and as such go to hell . secondly you said that god has never interacted with the human species himself except to speak to moses in the form of a burning bush . as such the fact that abortion exists is because of the free will god gave humanity and not an act of god itself in the same way that fertility treatments are an extension of jesus knowledge and love abortions were the extension of free will bestowed upon humanity so that we would not be animals . and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother . this means that we have the ability to make our own decisions whether to abort or not for example . for a start this is unclear as to go to heaven one needs to be christian baptised and been cleansed of sins three things that unborn babies can not do ,0
1065,but for your other point there are a estimated     females on earth  that could reach a orgasmic point before puberty and  case of someone under puberty having a kid and she gave birth to the kid at the age of of five and raised it . so yes if you are old enough to have the pleasure of sex your old enough to have the responsibility of a child . but that is the unanswerable question which is more important the baby or the fetus ,0
1067,in this debate i am against abortion and you are for ,0
1068,there is nothing to debate ,1
1069,it means that you should also not get all the benefits of a citizen including protection your rights etc . the same way that smoking is ruining your lungs but you can not blame the company simply because you already consented when you choose to smoke . and rather than prioritizing half living child in a womb it is better to prioritize parents who have spent half their life paying taxes fulfilling law and basically contributing to government . we also take some of their rights such as banning them to vote . especially when these children are also going to have a pretty bad future seeing that their parents choose to abort them ,1
1070,since my opponent has failed to provide definitions for this debate i will do so here . i will be posting my main argument in the second round but i challenge pro to answer these questions for me . anyways i look forward to the second round of this debate ,0
1071,this will make the child so upset and the child will have to live for the rest of his or her life knowing that he or her is a raped child . you said that its not the babies fault and the baby would not want to die but there also have been a very large number of cases of babies who have grown up found there real mothers asked them why they have been adopted and then the mother tells them the story . how would you feel if say for example your wife got raped got pregnant and could not have an abortion when she wanted to ,1
1072, t said it would interfere with their education a baby should not come into the world unwanted the reason why babies are being abused and tortured and killed could revolve around the parents not wanting them . this could give women more rights and make them be equal to men in rights viable able to survive outside the womb or after birth not a conception embryos and fetuses are not independent self determination beings so abortion is a termination of pregnancy not a baby . so they kill them and do so by torture not justifying child abuse the mom and dad could also be neglectfull not caring about what they are doing therefore another criminal would be raised .  of the turn aways became unemployed only  of women who got abortions were unemployed . when it was legalized this number dropped to  unsafe abortions because   deaths worldwide each year . women turned down an abortion are twice as likely to stay in abusive relationships and be victims of domestic violence . the cortex does not become functional unroll the  week of pregnancy long after most abortions are performed ,1
1073,good luck voters ,1
1074,my opponent has forfeited which is a shame because i was looking forward to having a good debate on this ,0
1075,this is according to the one of the only embryology textbooks used in medical schools langman s medical embryology written by thomas w sadler phd  continuing on with the point that a fetus is a human we have to realize that not only is the fetus being created by the human s natural processes it is a unique human individual just as each of us is . i will choose to focus on a fetus not a zygote or an embryo because most abortions happen during the fetal period .  fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm spermatozoon with a secondary oocyte ovum and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell . one very important point is that the entire biological and scientific communities agree on one common definition for human life one human individual s life begins at the completion of the union of his father s sperm and his mother s ovum a process called or . that is the amount of money that the state could have gained by not performing abortions . multiply the number of abortion    by   the average salary per year and then multiply it by  the average life expectancy . a fetus is simply the combination of the male sperm and the women s ovum . this fertilized ovum known as a zygote is a large diploid cell that is the beginning or primordium of a human being . combining the two creates an entirely unique organism not alike to its mother or father . to summarize the first contention i have concluded that a fetus is a living being is a unique human individual and is simply a stage of development in the human process . since the legalization of roe v wade in the united states there have been about  million abortion ,0
1077,lastly if con wants to just reject such bodily rights as mere assertions and not objectively established then the same can be done to their right to life how ever that right is defined assertions and arguments that operate on such an assumption . a case for unequal value  year old child vs   human embryos yes they are human in the genetic sense all human organisms are human in that sense contra any implications from con that i suggest otherwise . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the sufferings dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . it may come as a surprise to some pro lifers but a woman becoming pregnant does not strip her of any and all rights especially rights concerning the use of one owns body rights even pro lifers take for granted for themselves . in cons examples it is your own child at stake and yes we may take such action even saving our own  child over  not our own child this only shows that when our emotions something more primal is influencing our decision our rationality gets compromised but take such a situation where rationality is not comprised we save  children over  save one  year old over   day human embryos . alot of what con has to say is very general eg right to life value of humans as such these things could even be accepted for my side of the debate and in such a general sense do nothing to refute early abortion should legal . if i agree to take you on an airplane ride under the obligation that i will not at   feet i cannot change my mind and toss you out because i have given up my ownership of the airplane to that extent . if i agreed to work for you for a year for free and then change my mind the most you can do is demand material property as compensation you cannot enslave me without aggressing against my rightsin using a mother s body against her will a fetus carries out exactly this kind of aggression . change cons sink hole scenario to where all children are strangers you can either save  or them or  but not all  . con bites the bullet here so there position that abortion even early abortion is murder and thus what should be done to such women is consistent as con says . a case in point if adrian has a negative right to life against clay then clay is required to refrain from killing adrian while if adrian has a positive right to life against clay then clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of adrian ,1
1078, all arguments and sources shall be posted in the round .  only  cross x questions allowed for both sides .  debate resolution definitions and rules can not be changed ,0
1079,per the debate terms round  is for acceptance ,1
1080,imagine if you got raped and pregnant then you had to carry that baby for nine months . i am against killing a baby if you are just playing around . i think that abortion should be legal if you have been raped by a relative or a random stranger ,1
1081,the comic would be more accurate if in your comic god had said i stick with my previous argument ,1
1082,if we made laws based on potential low income uneducated minority folks would be thrown in jail by default because they are the demographic most likely to commit crimes . the potential argument swings both ways the fetus you aborted could be a serial rapist or create a master genocide plan . so and so ended up to be a wonderful person and their mother doubted whether to have kids ,1
1083,the average iq of the people in america is   i would say that i clearly doubt they would even make such a decision . moving on what you have claimed about i would like to state that if you are able to conduct what you wish if you have everything that is needed then i am unsure what is stopping you from doing so . are you actually implying that the human race would be ever so ,1
1084,sir do you have a life ,1
1085,i look forward to pro starting the debate ,1
1087,it is a future life ,0
1088,i am not debating validity of abortion at large but rather as it applies to this topic abortion when the health of the mother is at risk ,0
1089,unfortunately my opponent simply assumes that a womans right to trumps the innocent babys right to life . many people would say that an innocent persons right to life is the most important right above any other rights . it seems that my opponent admits that abortion is the killing of a human person . something inside of us cries against this position even if we try to rationalize it away . finally after a rape scenario what a woman primarily needs is love and a restoration of that dignity which has been so horribly snatched away from her not an abortion ,0
1090,it might seem funny for me to say that but due to the politically homogenous nature of my environment i was not sure . b before i read your topic i would have said absolutely yes a living human is a person . i do not believe they would qualify as human but not having a degree in biology i can not be sure . i would counter that seperated skin cells are not living which i believe is accurate though i might be mistaken . the government can ban a breed of dog and put down animals against the will of the owners in some cases ,0
1091,taking away the chance to experience life is heinous ,0
1093,you seemed to just be having a sort of rant make sure you say things like now on to the points  .  not good good luck in your future debate and i hope you pass your class  . you absolutely need to use sources and not just let them do the work for you ,0
1094, this is an appeal to consequence furthermore it does not make abortion wrong .  this seems like an extenionsn of the third point if the women getting an abortion does die which is exteremly rare but the women decided to end her pregnancy an accepted any risk in doing it does not make abortion wrong claiming that a women might die . a fetus has more in common with a tumor the first few weeks after a while it becomes more a parasite than anything else stealing nurtrients from it is host ,1
1095,extend all arguments even the hopelessly fallacious ones ,0
1096,so many of the girls use the money that comes from prostitution as a living and use it to buy shelter and ration . teens have sex on a regular basis and if they all keep the child then the human race will not be able to sustain its population and everything . teenagers like us do not know how to raise a child and abortion is one of the only ways to get out of the way . yes i agree but i mean to be honest the offspring was not there in the first place . people say that the world is becoming a worse place every day and honestly its because of us . i mean yes every one deserves to live but not everyone wants to go through that labor and then not be able to keep the child . you are right in your shoes and I am right in mine its just a matter of perspective ,1
1097, i certainly am aware people have their own personal ideas but i am using a defined and nationally agreed upon definition cited earlier in article  of the united nations universal declaration of human rights i believe i explained why it is good for society and individuals maintaining women s human rights which i briefly elaborated on i also believe it accomplishes all that i have reasoned in my arguments .  of the approximately  million abortions are performed by unskilled individuals in environments that do not meet minimum medical standards or both and unsafe abortion is the because of   maternal deaths each year plus many other health complication .  perhaps you hold some view that you are not responsible for not acting and or believe there is some arbiter to natural circumstances for death .  group sustainability does not only mean earth s population it can be in respect to her individual circumstances for sustainability as the possible child makes her a group of two whether by herself among a group of  or a larger group of a few thousand people and more . i hope you are not attempting to mask suffering in some ambiguous notions so to equate the suffering of a fetus or unborn child to a born child whose suffering will be greater because their capacity to realizing this burden on themselves and those in his her life . you are suggesting that we increase the number of orphans by possibly another  million a year .  this certainly is not true perhaps you have little concept of exponential population growth or the fact that all over the world people are dying from starvation dehydration bad hygiene a lack of basic human rights . the choice to abort or not to abort will have consequences you are not getting out of this either way you will be contributing to the death of a possible life . though there was slight drop in recent years in the us let us not forget around the world there are an estimated  million orphans your only adoption is not in proportion with reality which i think is a common problem with a number of your responses . sustainability has been the number one reason for most of human existence though i might add for most of that time the process of abortion was not understood and instead infanticide was the typical course taken . your use of the terms unborn baby and killing must arouse certain emotions in you so as to distract you from the further consequences of your lack of action to prevent unneeded suffering and the emotional physical damages caused by those state of events ,1
1098,i have laid out three cases in which abortion would be moral without the mothers life being threatened  in cases of severe genetic or developmental deformities to save the child from sufferingexample a child who is developing in the womb with organs on the outside of its body and its prognosis were it to live would be an excruciating child birth followed by no more than a day or two of life consisting of constant pain and suffering .  in cases of rapemy opponent has spent the majority of his time arguing against this case . unfortunately my opponent has blatantly refused to discuss the arguments i have presented instead dismissing them as cop outs ,1
1099,a person is defined in you s law as either a human being or a corporate business etc . i do not intend to argue about abortion cases in other countries and it does not seem my opponent does either though i doubt the definitions of murder are vastly different amongst most countries . note that definitions of laws and such will be kept under the jurisdiction of the united states . in current united states law at the moment of birth a biological being becomes a human being .  conclusion i argue that since a fetus is not a human being then the mothers right should be considered paramount . i have not debated in awhile and I am bored . additionally it is not murder therefore making the priority the womans body ,1
1100,i am not denying fetuses are living creations however the issue is abortion and how it should be womans right to terminate a pregnancy ,1
1101, as for my opponents sole argument i agree that the fetus belongs just as much to the father as it does to the mother . simply because the fetus resides in the mothers body does not giver her any more rights over the fetus because a fetus is not a part of the mothers body . however to force a woman to utilize her body in certain ways against her will is a violation of her legal rights . last time i checked a father is a person and according to my opponent a person has rights . as such the mothers body does not belong to the father and therefore the father has no jurisdiction over what the mother subjects her body to . similarly both the mother and father are equally the parents of this child and therefore have equal rights when it comes to determining the interests of the child . however a few things must be kept in mind ,0
1102,if you just think sometimes it should be allowed then we do not really disagree much and anything worth saying is probably just us talking past each other ,0
1104,please state your case ,0
1105,and it makes it clear in exodus    where it states if people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury the offender must be fined whatever the woman s husband demands and the court allows . there is also a reference to the unborn in psalm   where it talks about seeing an unformed body . if a problem arises such as a cancerous uterus then actions should be taken to eliminate the medical problem and if it results in the death of the unborn then it is tragic but it is not an abortion . well i would like to point out that the phrase is not in the constitution but rather it is in the declaration of independence so this is not even a valid reason to rebuttal . argument  abortion could save the life of the parent . the unborn will try to achieve internal balance but it might be unstable but the process of stabilization is homeostasis which is there just like it is in each of the living cells that make up the unborn . first my opponent claims since the early life can not survive outside of the womb makes in not a life . let me ask this question should we allow the parent of a born human who was conceived in rape to kill their born child . second should parents be able to kill their born children because they can not afford to take care of them . at least adoption offers a chance for the person to have a life while abortion will make sure there is no chance for them . with this proper understanding of what life it we can conclude that the unborn are living . it is important to note that the true question here is are the unborn human because if they are not then they do not get human rights and abortion should be legal but if they are human then they deserve the human right to life like every other human . to be murdered the unborn must first be alive which was confirmed in the last paragraph and must be human which is what i will cover here ,0
1106, picture this image for me a fetus or baby whatever word you would like to use with fingers toes fingernails toenails limbs etcf eatures me and you have and then the d x abortion procedure itself is rather gruesome . thirdly your points on the origin of the word foetus was irrelevant modern day meaning and the part on dolphins was also irrelevant because i never said dolphins should be protected . secondly if the heart does indeed form in  days then abortion is justified within  days .  protecting human life it is the core of the argument . remember i have to only defend certain forms of abortion you want it outlawed completley . making the point of conception the point where human life forms is opening the way for ridiculous laws . acog org more credible than your wikipedia sources you go on saying that my points are irrelevant although they defend my case and go against your points .  this was in context of a mothers life versus a foetus potential life . since no premature infants were younger than  weeks it did not determine the earliest age at which the fetus would feel pain . the abortion practitioner instrumentally reaches into the uterus grasps the fetus feet and pulls the feet down into the cervix . these results showed that the fetal brain can detect pain at least at  weeks of age ,1
1107,i think that abortion is cruel as it is cheating a person out of life ,0
1108,if you ask me denying life without consent in any way is murder ,0
1109,if you cannot handle a baby because you are not able too than think of the baby instead of yourself . i stand resolve that instead of abortion that we need to think of adoption so that a baby can have a mom and dad . people tend to forget that what if our parents believed in killing us instead of keeping us or at least putting us up for adoption ,0
1110,i would like to debate on the matters of abortion why someone would think its rite ,0
1111,which is why i feel so strongly that our government should be willing to provide more housing for them like i feel they should also spend money on the building of more prisons to eliminate the overcrowded prison problem that already exists in our country . obviously if the government is not willing to provide much more housing for the growing number of orphans then yes it is easy to see that the illegalization of abortion would compile overcrowded environments . i also agree that supply exceeds demand by a long shot but i disagree that the problem would be so long as there is a government willing to spend money on better programs and houses for orphans . allow me to just say that my next points referring to the slaughtering of animals and human babies of any development come from a biblical view and my faith that lies in god . hunting and killing animals that are wild and attack men or their domesticated animals is not considered evil either as david in the old testament had to kill a lion and a bear to protect his sheep as a part of his shepherds duty . the diligent hunter takes his game for food roasting and considers it a precious possession as he has food for his familys table . though from the  century through present day we have become much more civilized i still hold strong that courts of some sort and prisons did exist which would obviously serve as an alternate to the death penalty . we could both agree that most of the present nations do not kill each other for food and we certainly do not kill babies for food . i could name other atrocities of killing animals which take place with evil motives but i believe god looks on the heart and motives of men when it comes to how we treat his creatures and we shall be judged for it ,0
1112, how many girs does not said that but its not true is someone else body inside of yours its not your choice then ,0
1113,if a woman wants to have a child in the future she will likely find a mate and try intentionally over and over again to become pregnant with that mate until she is successfully pregnant . i have proven and con has not successfully disputed that the is true and it follows that the wanted child is much more likely to be born than the unwanted child . so the proof that a future wanted child will be born is in the fact that people do in fact have wanted children that are born after several attempts . if the forced fetus is a real living human and is forced into birth the wanted child would still not be born and would lose the opportunity for life . anyone can see that if a woman is forced to give birth to unwanted tissue she can lose a wanted child . so forcing the birth of an unwanted child denies life to a wanted child . one can never say prior to birth that it is a living human because we cannot know if it will remain alive . so until the day of birth if there is a successful birth we cannot know for certain that the fetus will be a living human . the only moral and reasonable thing a person can do is to reject the ideas of the pro life movement . usually a woman will at some time in her life become pregnant with a wanted child and carry that child full term until birth .  logically speaking if a natural law conflicts with a persons idea then the law would always win out over the idea that is unproven . as explained earlier dna is like computer code until the code is completely run we cannot be certain that there is a living human . if the woman conceives a wanted conception then the odds of an actual born child coming from that conception is the same for her with a wanted child as the odds are for an unwanted child . cons challenge is met the fetus in not a human and the the potential child from the is a living human being . once a woman has a birth that is successful then and only then has she proven the theory that a wanted child is almost certain . and even those that agree with con admit that the moment of conception is simply a part of the cycle of life . but the fact is that the forced fetus is not in fact a living human because we cannot know for sure that it will in fact live to be born . because women will try over and over again in order to become pregnant and actually give birth a wanted and willing pregnancy will result in a real child even though it is called a potential child . now the fact is that if there is doubt one should err on the side of the wanted child ,1
1114,now do not misunderstand me if someone killed your friend or family member i sympathize with you completely and i do not think they should be given light treatment just because I am opposed the death penalty . it is even worse when our court systems seek the death penalty for an inmate and solely base their judgment on the fact that our jails are crowded so we do not have the room to give this person life . people are so worried about peace on earth and our failing economy yet look at what we are doing this very second . but it is not right for someone to die for something completely evil they did . and it is not like we can send our prisoners to other countries either because that obviously costs money that we do not have . who are we to pass a life or death judgement on a human being . since our government does not know how to regulate its spending and how to not get into further debt people must die for it . money that piles on top of the  trillion dollars worth of debt we are in because our government can not control its spending . it is interesting that we as a nation are so worried about how high our crime rates are yet we hypocritically turn around and legalize abortion and the death penalty ,0
1115,this could have been a great debate ,1
1116,for instance the death penalty could condemn an innocent man to death and abortions could help an unexpected mother by getting rid of a baby that they are just not prepared to have for a number of reasons ,1
1117,a baby being genetically the same at conception or at any stage before birth as it is after birth does not mean it has the capability to make choices or use rights at all stages . the fetus has no cognitive ability to make sound decisions . the womans choice to not bring a fetus to term is akin to an adult making a judgement call regarding their offspring ,1
1118,this whole forfeiting thing is really not cool ,1
1119,no women should ever get an abortion i do not believe in them ,0
1120, pregnancy does always have medical risks but the mother agreed to take those risks because she had sex with a man and knew their was a possibility of pregnancy . in lack of a mutual consensus the dog owner mother should have to stick to her end of the deal and preserve the dog because she entered a mutual agreement with the other dog owner father to take care of this dog when they purchased it had sex . when we entered an agreement to mutually buy a pet symbolic of sex we accepted that we each had to do our part to ensure that whatever came out of this purchase of an animal was indeed mutual . requiring a woman to take unnecessary risks with her life and body and pregnancy always greatly increases medical risks just because the man who ejaculated into her says that she must is indicative of slavery and a blatant infringement upon her rights . proof of this is the fact that our legal system does not require the father to pay child support to a woman while she is pregnant with the fetus .  the father does not have a say in abortion because abortion is about the womans right to choose not the mans right to property . another question if this dog is both truly ours and just happens to be residing in your home at the moment what gives you the right to kill it without by permission ,0
1121,consider if you have agreed to donate your kidney to a possible recipient then there is no justification to willingly unplug and kill that recipient . viability is often used by pro choice advocates but this is a largely meaningless term that I would be happy to address in the next round if pro wishes . old child an interesting moral dilemma but i can play that game all day what if one room contained  strangers and the other contained your sister . i will do so on the basis of logic science and legal consistency under the assumption that human life deserves to be protected . the  unborn victims of violence act uvva section  says that any action that injures a child in utero can be punished as if the injury was inflicted on the mother herself even if the offender acted accidentally or had no knowledge she was pregnant . this is a very difficult question to answer since there is no clear answer to be found . incredibly this means that if a pregnant woman on her way to the abortion clinic gets hit by a texting driver survives but loses the baby then that driver can be charged with manslaughter . since pro claimed that an embryo even if we are meets zero criteria this argument is now at least in doubt if not refuted . sure you could say indirectly maybe but that standard could be applied to all of us i could be indirectly killing a coal miner in peru since my choice to flip a light switch on is driving the demand for a dangerous energy source . not only do embryos meet some of these criteria but this definition fails when applied to other groups of people and should be rejected . the problem is there is evidence that at just  weeks an embryo can hiccup and react to loud noises . the combination of  chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in  chromosomes in the zygote . yet if the woman arrives safely at the abortion clinic she can her baby in a perfectly legal and often celebrated procedure . to take it further let us apply these criteria to other people a brain dead person lacks   an unconscious person lacks   a severely mentally handicapped person lacks   on and on . if we once again relate this to our consenting organ donor then it appears pros analogy has little relevance . this is largely an irrelevant point since abortion is currently legal and it has nothing to say about why abortion should remain legal other than pro thinks it seems . there is not a single scientific argument to justify why a fetus is not a member of the human species ,0
1122,second let me state that personally i agree with the pro side but for the sake of debate i will try to argue the con side . are they a person and should they be excluded from human rights . what about individuals that have mental retardation or people who are brain damaged i guess to what degree would be of debate . first is appears that you are defining a as someone who has . should animals have and be regarded as a according to this defintion . i urge voters to judge not with their emotions but on logic and the arguments presented . if this is the case then i would argue that the pro has a flawed definition of a ,1
1123,could not it be said that the wrong doer should be forced to give that person blood and maybe even a kidney at least as long as the wrong doer would not die . and the last reason it should be illegal in principal is because the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy . also while this does not apply at first as the pregnancy continues the mother assumes the fact that the pregnancy continues to exist and she is not aborting when it is morally grayer . but on the other hand the earliest cell does meet the requirements for what would constitute an organism albeit it could probably be viewed as more like a parasitic organism given it must live off of the mother . the common arguments in favor of abortion should be used here as holistic approach to why she should be able to decide given the various moral considerations involved . i would take that same reasoning though and argue that it is such a strong consideration that it should at least be illegal albeit with no legal consequences . why should mothers liberty continue to be hindered due to someone who came as a burglar to begin with . the pro and con about human life here are enough to say in principle we should defer to human life but not clear enough to make any meaningful punishments for it . it is unclear there as it could be said to be with personhood . the person who caused the crash should not be able to evict the victim by tossing them to sea or killing them . you could replace planes and islands with cars and the wrong doers home .  aside from rape and mothers health and perhaps fetal defect abortion should be illegal including the first trimester but not investigated nor punished . they are sustained by your kidneys and need them for awihle to live ,0
1124,thirdly i want to bring this into the arguments because this is personal to me . i thank you for the debate and apologize in advance if i was rude or harsh in any way to you in round i . my cousin matthew alex has many disabilities it is hard for him to walk speak and eat among other things ,0
1125,the supreme court recognizes that the state constitution of alabama which states that the people of this state have the right to go through the abortion process as long as it is not after  weeks of the pregnancy at the point when the government is seeking laws to protect this so called baby they are valuing and respecting the life of the baby . at this point the government fails to be a democracy and a protecter of the peoples rights but an oppressor of the people and since we are looking at the united states this form of government is not what we are trying to pursue . so now as thomas jefferson says in the preamble we the people have the obligation to take action against a form of government that is an oppressor to the people ,1
1126,also as i have stated if she does not want a child but becomes pregnant by her lover her situation is not likely to drastically change in the next nine months to where she will be ready to have a child . you will notice that liberty cannot even supply one expert in the field of embryology to back up his claims even after i have invited him to do so . you are not only advocating the death of an unwanted child you are advocating the death of all those supposed embryos fetuses on top of the unwanted one all because she wants to get a one . liberty seems to be the only person in all of existence who would argue the unborn zygote embryo fetus could be anything other than human . the only moral and reasonable thing a person can do is to reject the ideas of the pro life movement . i have amply shown that it does not and you have failed to refute the scientific biological fact that all unborn children are living human beings from fertilization . my point that if a woman becomes pregnant with her lover yet does not want it her situation is not likely to drastically change in the nine months she would be pregnant with the unwanted child remains uncontested and i extend this argument to my final round . if the womans body naturally flushes out a conceptus or if her body does miscarry this does not give us the right to take an unborn life willingly . i ask you the reader which of us holds the more immoral and unreasonable viewpoint . this is an erroneous viewpoint scientifically as i have shown from the experts in the field . the abstract child is not alive has not been conceived and therefore by keeping the unwanted child no life is being lost . i daresay that liberty does not know people and therefore cannot honestly make this claim . i have invited liberty to show any experts in embryology who state that the unborn are not living humans from fertilization . i ask the reader which is more moral and reasonable to kill a child because they are unwanted or to want to protect children who are unwanted . actually the point of this debate as per your own resolution is that this law governs the morality of abortion . liberty keeps talking about but there is nothing to kill if the future child has not been conceived . no as you have pointedly ignored we can not even be sure the newborn will be a living human since it may get sids ,0
1127,i shall now begin with my points at the root level aborting a baby is taking away a chance at a life a friend to others the potential for growing other people who the baby would have met over the course of its life . therefore a potential life being thrown away and the positive impacts that that life would have on other people will often outweigh a womans right to choose what to do with her body especially since she will also be impacted by such a baby . however there are times in which the birth of a child will because suffering rather than happiness and building of people ,1
1129,abortion is wrong there are many other things you can do than to kill the innocent child inside of you like adoption ,0
1131,while pro thinks that good government policy should take into account the economy personal liberty and quality of life it must be remembered that con shares those ideas . again i claim that third trimester abortions should be illegal in the united states assuming development within normal parameters unless the life of the mother was at stake . if this value was lost or even demoted it would easily and logically lead to a slippery slope of questioning other fundamental ethics such as the respect to children and babies i e following the event of birth . essentially if it were alright to kill a fetus in the third trimester both of us agreeing it has the attribute of sentience assuming development within normal parameters then logically nothing would be wrong with infanticide . there is one distinct reason that can be deduced as to why the value of sentient life largely dominates other values in decision making ultimately leading to con winning this debate if our society were to demote the intrinsic value of sentient life from decision making chaos would readily follow . con claims that the value of sentient life largely dominates other values in decision making while pro claims the contrary . first of all just as a point of reference many debate whether or not sentience is measured on a scale or if it is indeed a black and white issue . by the killing of a third trimester fetus with sentience it permits the killing of other sentient beings . i was merely stating in my round  that it is more ethical to allow the parasite to die by default . however it is in the power of the united states to allow all pregnant chinese women to come into the united states . if you look at my profile however you will see that i am against vegetarianism peta ,0
1132,as a collective and society we ought to respect human life in the third trimester by allowing it to progress and further its development . please note that my objective in this debate is to prove that assuming development within normal parameters the abortions of third trimester fetuses should be illegal in the united states unless the life of the mother is at stake . in this particular debate i am arguing that third trimester abortions assuming development within normal parameters be banned unless the life of the mother is at stake ,0
1133,this is demonstrably false as anyone can fabricate thousands of worthless arguments that do not prove a point whereas even one that does is superior to them all . the problem with the overpopulation argument is that it ignores two very important facets of human existence . however my opponent has not objected to utilitarian morality which represents the moral value of something in terms of happiness . rather it is like this if g is the level of happiness in the rest of the world when the woman must make their decision for abortion qa is the quality of life decrease for the aborted fetus and qn is the decrease for the woman who does not get an abortion these are the resulting happiness levels if she gets an abortion the result will be ga . the problem lies in the resource distribution system in which large amounts of resources are concentrated into a small percent of the population . you might say that being dependent upon its mothers resources means that it is part of its mothers body . lastly my opponent has stated that it is absurd to represent the values of life to a mathematical equation ,0
1134,but was it was not something for which men and women give up their liberties for . am i to understand that the sentient life of others is worth more than our own personal liberties .  patrick henry to the virginia house of burgesses is there a value to sentient life . but to be frank i do not care how sentient the fetus is . if the british came tomorrow to our shores to chain our women are we to sit idly with our thumbs twiddling because the british are sentient lives .  at the beginning of the debate i raised the issue of personal liberty . i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death ,1
1136,yea woman should be allowed to make decisions regarding their body but not for abortion they should watch how they dress and who they go to bed with as i said before use a condom if you do not want to get pregnant safety first . i understand that women have fought for their freedom but in this case abortion should not be illegal taken a life of a child is not right . ok but that is a different story though if the mothers life is in danger it does not mean she is giving up on the baby and giving an abortion it means she has been hurt and it could effect the baby ,0
1137,most recently the european court of human rights in the case vo v france ruled that it is neither desirable nor even possible as matters stand to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purpose of article  of the convention providing that veryone s right to life shall be protected by law . the only qualifier for you s citizenship rights is in fact being born in the you s pro says and contests this extends to all persons .  see e g human rights committee concluding observations mali para  . the court therefore refused to adopt a ruling that would have called into question the validity of laws permitting abortion in  member states of the council of europe .  I am honestly not sure if based on the debate structure i am allowed to re cap my arguments . the bottom line is this my opponent tries to use the united nations declaration of human rights in his favor but the undhr overwhelmingly favors pro choice legislation . the mother has the right to privacy and bodily autonomy if fetuses can live outside of her body on their own fine . to uphold the rights of women and achieve gender equality worldwide ban states you n members must . if i consent to sex and contract an std it would be ridiculous to suggest i must be forced to live with this std forever or for a certain period of time against my will . he goes on to explain why the scotus decision is flawed directly after telling us that we must accept the laws document as written . if not they do not have the right to put her body in jeopardy and use someone elses body . a few sentences later he criticizes the laws decision for validating abortion through roe v wade . several un human rights bodies have recognized the harmful impact of restrictive abortion laws on women s health and have consistently raised general concerns about the inaccessibility of safe abortion services ,1
1138,extend all arguments ,1
1139,the reason that i believe that a child is human at the first stage of its life because it was created by human reproduction the embryo contains human dna the second the egg is fertilized and because it has the potential to become a fully grown human being ,0
1140,the key feature of a child which demands it the protection of law is not that it is presently a rational thinking self aware being but rather that it will become one when it reaches adulthood and certainly this is no less true of the child in utero . the property owner is the absolute ruler of their property and just as i can expel you from my home if you remain there without my consent so a mother is the absolute ruler of her body and can expel the invader the baby from her body if she wishes . by saying that the state in reality some bureaucrat or judge or cop can dictate to a mother what she can or cannot do with her body you are really saying that the mother is the slave to the judge or cop or bureaucrat that it is the bureaucrats body and he will instruct the mother on how she may use his property her self ,1
1141,even if it was a fact that abortion is murder the government is not allowed to pass a law which contradicts the consensus or even in some cases the near majority . in other words you have not yet attacked my conclusion nor my premises . when roe v wade passed in  a year after the above mentioned statistic deaths from abortion drastically dropped . this is supported by the national center for health statistics own statistics .   the declaration of human rights and not the declaration of peoples rights ,1
1142,if the law contradicts this the law loses because law is subordinate to morality in any philosophical system not the other way around . the fact that the law currently enslaves minors is not a demonstration that it should . the law says that your parents are responsible for your education health and well being . again law subordinate to morality therefore this is not a valid point . lowering the number of years they have lived to below  does not magically change this ,1
1143,i will argue that people who are against abortion are anti choice not pro life and my opponent will argue that they are pro life not anti choice . i will wait for my opponent to respond to this claim with their counter arguement . fetuses can t feel any pain during abortions nor are they at all aware of their surroundings or what is happening ,1
1144,we still have other factors contributing to population and the population only increases with each year .  population control is a world wide problem since we all share the same static resources on the same rock . addressing it now is easier than addressing it when it is too late or denying it like people like to do with global warming ,1
1145,they do not gain the ultimate right that of voice in government until they are  .  in the mythical world you would live in a  yr old would be thrown into the streets to fend for him herself and a  old can do as he pleases and if he is harmed so be it there is no moral obligation of the parent to see no harm comes to their child and to you the harm to a child is justice for the child actions . the law says that your parents are responsible for your education health and well being .  the body of law as it applies to minors is based on the constitution however as a minor you are subject to the instructions and policies set forth by your parents . see my  on the nature of rights . they are not allowed to work at any regular job nor are they allowed to drive until  in most states and some are moving that up to  . that ought to establish that aristotle too is not a valid reference for the rights of man . parental authority in operating an orderly household trumps all else if these conditions are met . you cannot disprove the notion that x has a given right by pointing out that the laws do not respect those rights ,1
1146,even a child of rape is a child it is a horrible circumstance but if you acknowledge that abortion is an evil why do two evils make a good . i guess my question is do all humans have an absolute right to life regardless of their utility . i say this because you say that abortion is inherently wrong because it ends a life you are in effect saying that ending lives is wrong . this looks at the value of human life as though it was a direct reflection of the utility of that person . to your first point i think if we believe that abortion is ok then there is no need to explain why you abort someone ,0
1147, this is more comparable to abortion in cases of rape than agreeing to donate a kidney because with abortion and the above situation the person forfeiting bodily autonomy had bad luck which led to the other persons problem rather than the other way around . if someone let us call him joe owned his own space station and terrorists rigged a bomb in and said the station that would blow up new york if he opened the door he would not have the right to do so since it was his responsibility to keep his property safe in the first place . good since infanticide does not because more good than harm if the above exhibits are seen as convincing then abortion should likewise be viewed as a net loss for society ,1
1148,thank you david for challenging me to this debate ,1
1149,if you do think that a fetus has the right to life i would also like to point out that regulating abortions does not mean you decrease the number of abortions that take place . this is a proven impact of making abortions illegal on president bushs first day in office he reinstated the global gag rule which suppressed all aid foreign aid that went to ngos that engaged in abortion activity . i will focus my position on some of the major points first is the question of whether or not aborted fetuses are at a point of development when it can be considered a life . while making them illegal could deter some women from seeking abortions it does not address the fundamental causes of abortion social pressures the reason that there is a demand for abortions now . this does not in itself demonstrate that such abortions are morally permissible but it does show that the rights based argument against abortion fails to show that they are impermissible ,1
1151,so i can just as easily say to pro that if a man truly wanted a woman to have his baby he could have should have had sex only in a legal or spiritual commitment such as marriage where both parties agreed to have a baby should pregnancy be the consequence of their actions . first of all it is amusing how the house has come to represent the mother when originally the house represented the father pro said in  if i had your dog in my house would i be able to do with it whatever I would like . if a woman was hired to be a surrogate mother and upon childbirth did not want to give up the child she would be under violation of a reproductive contract . he has ignored my entire argument which has been that the dog cannot represent the fetus because a dog is a living entity outside of myself whereas a fetus is not a living entity outside of the mother . therefore even if one was inviting the consequence of pregnancy this debate is once again not about whether abortion is right or wrong but whether or not a male has any right to force a woman to carry a child to term . pro then said we have already said in the resolution that the mothers health and therefore body does not have a bearing because this is a . yes i agree that contraceptives are for those who want to enjoy the physical pleasures of sex in a responsible way to not transmit disease or result in an unwanted pregnancy . the father is essentially useless once fertilization occurs and even that happens as a result of his ejaculated sperm the father does not do anything himself to fertilize the egg that all happens within the mothers body .  just because the risks associated with the average pregnancy may not fall under the category of a does not mean that other health concerns are not elevated in general in association with pregnancy . when a child is a fetus the father has no responsibilities they all lie with the mother whom is carrying it . because abortion is legal and not the subject of this debate we must accept that abortion is an alternative for those who get pregnant and consider abortion a viable option .  she is the one who gains weight and other body defects she is the one who gives birth and she is the one on which the fetus relies for survival etc .  pro says the house in the analogy represents the mothers body ,1
1152,a rodent which may be more sensous in the present has little capacity to develop in the future . whilst it is true that scenario  would have more happiness in the enclosed bubble of that scenario if this scenario was applied to everyone throughout wider society then the lack of equality would lead to an unstable society . next he writes political devices such as human rights of which i affirmed liberty is one of the most fundamental are required which does not entail maximising happiness on a case by case basis . illegal legal abortionscon states that i have not provided a shred of evidence to support my claim that prohibiting abortion would reduce the frequency of abortion . the former has absurd conclusions because it includes potential beings as well of which there are near infinite amount of which would render it impossible to pragmatically assess the utility of a certain law . in individual cases enforcing equality can lead to less happiness but for a whole society the overall happiness is maximised by having equality . so utility does not necessarily have to know what happiness is defined as it just needs to allow the maximising of happiness indirectly by allowing the pursuit of happiness . if legally enforced human rights caused a net decrease in happiness for the people involved then there would be no reason to have them . but we must consider the future of the person in a utilitarian calculation since the past is irrelevant and the present infintesimal . cons argument is actually a rebuttal of the principle of maximise happiness yet this is not what i argued for . generally there are things that we almost universally find to be conducive to happiness such as life liberty love and knowledge so even if we cannot exactly quantify happiness we can still recognise an increase of happiness as well as compare peoples happiness .  from  to  and wrote that one factor that played a role was the increased amount of anti abortion legislation that was passed at the state level .  whilst they rights do not entail maximising happiness on a case by case basis they entail maximising happiness if a rule is instigated that enforces them . this is because human rights only exist because their existence causes an increase in net happiness even if this does not happen in each individual situation where rights conflict with utility . the latter only considers actual beings which is much more pragmatic because there is the ability to know roughly the resultant utility of our actions by seeing how it will affect those involved . but this is only in cases where there is no chance that they will live a future life . i am definitely not asserting that the government ought to maximise happiness on a case by case basis since this goes beyond the governments role as a legislative authority . if it is known that a brain dead patient will recover and live a long life thereafter then the government certainly would not be justified in killing them . hence con is misguided in implying that rights and liberties form the basis of a governmental ethic ,0
1154,the child would be better off with parents who care and have enough money to support them and what not . and i do not eat eggs or seeds simply for the fact that they are still children . this would be better for the mother and the child if the mother did not have an abortion ,0
1155,thanks for instigating good luck and happy holidays ,1
1156,before this the fetus cannot feel pain it does not know it is alive it is essentially a growth . this is the point where the part of the fetuss brain responsible for consciousness starts to develop . if this person is hooked up to a life support system their next of kin can legally decide to . even if this was the case a pro choice argument can still be made . similarly the fetus is dependent on it is mothers and has not obtained the mental capacity to make its own choices . science estimates that the earth is only fit to handle about   billion people . as the amount of people increase so does world hunger and poverty . and if a fetus is considered to be a separate person then where do you draw the line . for the sake of simplicity let us imagine that none of these questions apply ,1
1157,i could not work up the strength to respond ,1
1158,my first argument will be centered around the profound affect that a pregnancy can have on a womans life and how this choice needs to be one of the people directly involved and anything other than that is imposing tough consequences on the woman herself and those loved ones . first i want to establish that i will be focusing on the principle of abortion and thoroughly believe that the time when you can actually get an abortion should be decided by medical professionals and the women involved . my second argument is philosophical and centered around what makes a human a person ,1
1159,my opponent said that my claim is false because i said it would be appropriate to abort a baby if it affected the mothers health my argument is that a abortion for the mothers own convenience is wrong and again is like killing a human outside of the womb ,0
1160,i know you are not advocating it but that would be the next logical progression since once we are allowed to chose the gender why not the eye colour and skin colour . this is a collective group the status will not increase if they arbitrarily demand an increased status .  do you seriously believe that there will be so many successful rapes women who will get pregnant choose to give birth to the child fathers and mothers who will not look after the child to the point that there will be an increase in poor people .  south korea is the only country that equalized its male female ratio and it was a country that legalized ssa and enforced it vigorously . my opponent does not seem to think this is a problem however for me it would be then we would ask for illegalizing ssa making it pretty useless to legalize it in the first place . there are so many factors that shape the decision that one or two of the points in the checklist are bound to be overlooked . applying the same logic to women the fallacy would be that though women would gain importance they would be targeted when they are not strong . the societal structure would shift making this pretty common and as a result though no one is stopping them the need would reduce further . once ssa is legalized the clinics will start publicizing it and try to play on the insecurity of the populace and emphasize on the illogicity of having a girl when you can have a boy . they would be pushed in the trade when young and by the time they gain sense either they would like the life or they would be too addicted to drugs and all to get out of it . an unhealthy trend also i addressed every claim of my opponent and provided sound sources to back up my rebuttals and claims .  if they can find a mate it will be in their interest the principle is similar to respecting other people s right to life to not perform rapes . during marriage asking whether the family allows ssa cannot be the deciding factor because as can be quite obvious in any searching for the boy process compromise is accepted . to which i responded that this would not be sustainable because of increase in illegitimate children . the fisher s principle is not valid over here because it argues that increased mating prospects will translate to better status whereas as i have argued it will lead to declining status because of the increased crimes against women and because of increased pressure on them to get married .  alright better mating prospects will only result in an increased status if women utilize better mating prospects to demand an increased status .  caste consideration of the male would not matter since females would have plenty of choice from their own caste .  i know abortion is legal but it is legal when the fetus is a danger to the woman or has a high probability of being profoundly handicapped .  caste considerations would become irrelevant when compared to not getting a mate at all ,0
1161,when ethics are concerned there is nothing wrong with expending some extra non medically required resources to ensure that women have all the information they need to make a judgement about abortion ,1
1162,i reject the idea that a woman being told by others what she can do with her body is up to them . i must say that to ban abortion would be to ban the womans right to decide the fate of her body . if a womans life is threatened by the birth of this child if the child is a product of rape or incest or if the child will be born into a quality of life so poor it is inhumane then the birth of this child should be decided by the mother to terminate . it is hers and the choice is hers to painlessly terminate the baby . i reject the idea that a child should be born regardless of what the mother wants ,1
1163,abortion should not be legal in any circumstances because if it were legal then it would unleash the evil entity known as cthulhu from the pacific ocean and would lead to  years of darkness for all of humanity ,1
1164, debate let the audience note my opponent has only addressed the cross examination section of my rebuttal .  cross examination redux  my opponent writes that he believes life begins at conception . my opponents rather pointed question begins with an invalid premise therefore any attempt to answer it will also be invalid . had my opponent stated something like the introduction of the nervous system or a beating heart i could understand more . for the sake of an interesting debate i urge my opponent to address the arguments i made in my opening statement for his closing argument even if it breaks traditional debate rules . by not responding to any of my arguments and counterarguments he concedes all his arguments and accepts all my arguments thereby conceding this entire debate . my response a humans essence is not premeditatedly determined by some destiny but is determined by his genes and environment ,1
1165,thank you for proving me wrong ,1
1166,abortion is not murder because the fetus has not developed enough to be considered a person yet and is virtually only a bunch of cells also it should be the mothers choice on whether they abort the baby or not ,1
1167,for example ethel waters was born in chester pennsylvania on october   as a result of her mothers rape at age  . there is also the life of george washington carver one of the brightest american minds of the twentieth century he had a horrible start starting with being born in slavery father and family killed mother and sister kidnapped and never seen again left on the side of the road with a big brother that later died . she never lived in the same place for more than  months . or maybe they have a break down and their spouse divorces them and the child is teased mercilessly at school . why not abort the  year old child who got hit by a car and became mentally I will and is now a burden after the parents lost their jobs and lost their home because of medical bills .  in short because of her unpleasant life she inspired millions . despite this unpromising start waters demonstrated early the love of language that so distinguishes her work ,0
1168,first of all yes i condone murder when it is justified i agree with the death penalty and abortion and suicide . if you do a little research you will see that far more people are being born into this world then leaving it especially since the life expectancy of humans has doubles in the past few hundred years people are living way too long hence the resulting overpopulation . logical thinking and realistic planning like allowing more people to die might just prolong the death of this planet for a little while longer if not then at least it will save me from getting robbed in ten years by those starving broke kids you thought had a right to live even though their moms welfare check can not feed them enough after her new wardrobe and hairstyle ,1
1169,constitutionality it is important to note that there is no right to an abortion anywhere in the constitution but there is an explicit right to life which can not be deprived without due process of law . adult stem cellsit is true i did not rebuttal this un sourced point and it was because this point is irrelevant to the issue if abortion is ok just like saying we could mine the earth for coal but that is irrelevant to is mining ok . hopefully to all those reading this debate will see how my opponent failed to argue and defend the position that the unborn were not human or not living therefore the unborn are living humans and deserve the equal protection for the right to life . or if you disagree with public nudity do not get nude in public do not stop someone else i am not forcing anyone to get nude in public it should be the persons choice . poor quality of lifemy opponent says well if the child is on the streets being too cold or too hot always wondering where your next meal would come from . adoptionthat is all stuff that could happen but being adopted could benefit them by helping others find foster parents such as the case with dave thomas the founder of wendys . orif you disagree with gun ownership do not get an gun do not stop someone else i am not forcing anyone to get an gun it should be the persons choice . two my argument was comparing situations in which people choose for others such as killing an unborn due to poverty and killing a born due to poverty . body autonomymy opponents has a strange claim here . my opponent claims the spectrum argument is irrelevant because a child has the right to choose once they are born . if you think this reasoning is valid then anything else that could be filled in there would be valid ,0
1170,the court ruled   that a right to privacy under the due process clause of the  amendment extended to a womans decision to have an abortion but that this right must be balanced against the states two legitimate interests in regulating abortions protecting womens health and protecting the potentiality of human life . i am open to the idea that maybe abortion should be more restricted in the later stages but being open to that possibility is not the same as just assuming it i would need to see arguments in support such a thing that can withstand critical scrutiny . restricted abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy ,1
1171,it is indeed a semantic argument because you arguing this point so rigidly while of course we have to take into play the basic definition provided there is no reason why an argument should be based solely on a definition . the point is in magnitude when having a child only   of women suffer post pardum depression and these symptoms are temporary and caused by hormonal imbalances . also my opponent claims that babies are parasites which is not true it is a commensual symbiotic relationship and that if more women had abortions we would not have to worry about many of the problems we have ,0
1172, at  that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors physical emotional psychological familial and the womans age relevant to the wellbeing of the patient . an abortion is necessary is a professional judgment that the georgia physician will be called upon to make routinely . so to keep with the snpirit of roe v wade legally more regulations should exist in the third trimester ,0
1173,there are two and a half abortions per minutes in the us I would speculate that those are not being done because of a last resort . at that level of pregnancy hteres no dispute that it is murder when it has little justification . if their means they are upset their parents might disown them that is not enough of a justification to kill someone ,0
1175,it costs money that could be better spent on programs that provide benefits to society . if as my opponent says then it only makes sense that the law should be enforced .  a law that is not enforced is a waste of taxpayer money ,1
1176,there is no point of bringing a child into this world so that it can bounce from group home to group home never knowing who its real parents are ,1
1178,do you think that those unborn children would say no to you killing them and say yes to giving them a chance at life ,0
1179,i think that raped teenagers need to focus on school and do not have time for a baby . having a baby is a serious commitment that takes  months . the teenagers should focus on school so they can go to a good college if they want to ,1
1180,while he did potentially save those men from dying in the cold the mother initiated the situation out of her own choice and in terminating it or exercising her rights is directly responsible for the death . while i agree that the mother should have rights over her own body these rights cannot be exercised when they strip rights from others as is one of our countrys fundamental constitutional principles . while the landlord faces no burden in saving the men he can choose to unsave them and exercise his rights .  eviction as you have presented abortion therefore is only justified in a scenario where an equal right of the mother is being withheld . the mother on the other hand sees a perfectly healthy child on the bank of a river and pushes him in ,0
1181,also note that this round is not meant for clash of arguments but for presentation of each sides stance . round   debate and clash use you own common sense for this . no vulgarity keep it clean definitions these definitions are simply for structure and understanding of what this debate is about as a whole ,0
1182,i will also be examining ideas relating to morality such as the individuality of the fetus putting your own rights above others and the abortion industry as a whole which is completely immoral . i am very interested in your second argument and thus will present the argument this is meant to rebut first . i will be examining alternatives such as adoption as well as looking into the psychological stress and harm abortion can because the recipient the mother as well as the doctor ,0
1183,my study was one that actually observed the two events in actions and studied them while my opponent just pulled numbers from random . rule violationwith this debate end i would like to remind you that my opponent has violated the rules by arguing in round one . of course you would get arrested since you broke chinese law and the us would arrest you and turn you over to the chinese . my opponent stated that the  amendment protects persons but he never actually defines what a person is . with this being the first round i shall go over everything for this debate and then close it out ,1
1184,really i hate abortion pretty much until it comes down to the health of the mother . that is   deaths in just one year because there parents do not want them . in the case of rape the woman should really bare the child ,0
1185,it seems unclear why you are intrested in this subject seeing as it will always be the mothers decision and you will never have a say in her choices ,1
1187,according to this clause the fundamental human rights of life liberty and property should not be infringed without due process of law last i checked the woman is not judge jury and executioner an abortion clinic is not a court of law and is not a legitimate violation to constitute the death penalty ,0
1188,my position on this particular subject is no matter what happened no matter what you are going through even if the baby is going to wreak your short term life you can not bring a baby back from the dead when it is convenient the baby does not deserve to die because its mother got raped or went to that wild party and in the small chance of teen pregnancy i do not think that teens should be pregnant but once they get pregnant they should have to give birth of course with assistance i can not think of any argument that excuses the right to live because of someones personal convenience issues .  since life begins at conception abortion is akin to murder as it is the act of taking human life .  million american families wanting to adopt a child there is no such thing as an unwanted child a good society can survive people doing immoral things but a good society can not survive when people call immoral things moral ,0
1189,by having the abortion you are taking the life of a little person that is growing inside you when the one you should be punishing is the person who commited that horrible act of rape . for example rape victims believe their case is justified but the truth is that by having an abortion you are punishing an innocent unborn child which you could of found a nice family for him to be adopted . they are just taking the easy way out instead of taking responsability for their act i will end this par of my argument with stating the legal principal that says ,0
1191,if abortion is murder reducto argument if it is the case that abortion in the embryonic stage is equivalent to murder as some anti choicers assert then that means all women who have had an abortion in that period should all be in jail doing sentences for murder maybe even the death penalty as well as any future women who will have such an abortion . like wise it is argued a pregnant women can take action to be unplugged from the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with her pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep them alive such is yours hers bodily rights freedom . they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own . all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus for my purposes in this debate the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person . the logical point is that any anti abortion argument that is built upon such an absolute right to life right not to be killed has at it is foundation a false premise and can be rejected as such not to mention the double standard of selectively applying it in the case of pregnancy to deny abortion rights . so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . now consider the burden being imposed or argued to be imposed on a pregnant woman from the moment of contraception that being she should be forced to continue even against her will for a period of around  months . for example we do not consider it an unjust burden to demand enforce that people do not poison the water supply but we would consider it an unjust burden to say restrict people to only wearing thick wool coats no matter how hot it is . in the embryonic period the human organism has no current capacity to have an active or ideal desire an ideal desire being a desire which would exist had there not being a cognitive distortion . a case for unequal moral  year old child vs   human embryosconsider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door are   day human embryos behind another a  year old child . but as i argue they are not equal the  year old child not only trumps one  day human embryo it even trumps one hundred ,1
1192,the proportion of people having sex without contraception will not necessarily be high just because there is abortion available ,1
1194,i think that the mother should not have to have a child if she does not want to if we do not allow legal safe abortions people will find other means of aborting an unwanted child if they are motivated enough ,1
1195,i was looking forward to this debate so I am willing to ignore the forfeit in hopes that pro will post an argument in the next round ,0
1196,provided that semantics are common on this site i will provide a list of rules to prevent anyone from twisting this debate to their advantage . it is implied that women who get abortions during their first trimester or use birth control to prevent pregnancy are not selfish . pro nor con may not change or attempt to change this resolution . this is the definition of selfish that me and my opponent will use for this debate .  with the exception of rule  ,0
1197,it is weird that we have so few infant deaths in recent years no matter what the case ,1
1198,first off I would like to dispute the claim that an abortion is the equivalent of murder which seems to be my opponents central argument . but one of the more compelling reasons for abortion is that it helps deter crime . studies show that these unborn children were fifty percent more likely to live in poverty and sixty percent more likely to grow up with just one parent . the child does not get to grow up in an environment they deserve and the family will be trapped in debt trying to pay the bills to support a baby . second of all when you murder someone you are hurting the people who are close to this person and it leaves them traumatized . when it is in utero it is similar to being in a deep sleep only that they have nothing to dream about and nothing to experience . these two factors childhood poverty and a single parent household are among the strongest predictors that a child will have a criminal future . this leads me to my next argument for abortion . abortion does not hurt anyone this way because the parents actually want it . however a fetus is nothing more than a ball of cells . only in the late third trimester would the fetus even come close to looking human ,1
1199,a teen should not have to raise a baby if they are not ready . i see where you are coming from but the fetus does not feel pain until  weeks if it is past  weeks then i agree with you but before  weeks is fine . who would care for a disfigured baby due to incest ,1
1200,it is never determined for sure that any of the things you have said may happen . you weigh your options between keeping someone unconsciously alive that has no hope or taking them off life support . i do not blame you saying as this is the strongest aspect of any abortion debate . I am curious as to how would defend this type of scenario as opposed to the stereotypical rape victim argument . becoming a criminal hating life because of feeling neglected due to lack of parents or being disease ridden are all possibilities but the chances of those things happening are minute ,0

1202,life organism my opponent argues that since a fetus is an organism then abortion should not be legal . i have two objections to this a life forms are not necessarily human beings . the law should be concerned with protecting it is citizens from other citizens not to try to be a nanny . so everything i kill a mosquito i should be imprisoned . so if a kid procrastinates which means he is irresponsible should he be punished by law ,1
1203,a person is a person no matter how small though ,0
1204,pro life people argue that unborn children have rights that must be protected as well i would argue that since late term unborn babies are developed to a level of physiological complexity at which thought can occur their is no reason whatsoever that they ought not be treated as persons and be acknowledged as having human rights . i acknowledge that women have a right to privacy and to act in regard to their body but submit that in this kind of case in which two peoples rights conflict they must be measured and balanced . in measuring the two parties rights it becomes quite clear that simply allowing the killing of one party to avoid getting involved in the intimate affairs of the other is not a just solution . being that a person is deserving of rights based upon their being a person that is based upon their own internal characteristics . that is it is not reasonable to simply ignore the rights of one party ,0
1206,live birth abortion is just another type of abortion and does not differ from the main point of abortion it is the mothers choice to have the baby or abort it . it is the mothers decision no matter how far along into the pregnancy it is . the baby is not born is not a citizen and therefore has no rights ,1
1207,if a women was not ready for the commitment yeah she should have tought about what she was doing but that does not me that she lost the ability to decided what to do with her pregnancy i do think their is a time when it should be consider inhumane but if the fetus have not fully developed i think that theirs not a big deal regarding wether a women decided to abort her child or not ,1
1208,my opponent states that we must consider adoption before abortion however they seem to have ignored the constitution and the fact that adoption is still an available and encouraged process . my opponent also decided to throw in a nice little snippet rather unrelated to the debate at hand saying . not only does this amendment give the states the power to allow abortion if they decide that a fetus is not alive by law it gives further power to the people . and the majority of women having abortions are single meaning those fetuses would not have fathers . the united states government as a whole has no power over matters of the state . for example abortion is legal in california because the states judicial system ruled that a fetus was not alive until a certain stage of pregnancy . however many pro life activists call abortion which is indeed quite illegal as it infringes upon another citizens rights like living . as a point of clarification my opponent seems to be the pro in relation to the topic therefore i am the con . my opponent says that the entire country should not value it ,1
1209,abortion is a very contravertion topic laws should be made to avoid causes that lead to that such as under age pregnancy . there are options to avoid abortion such as thinking with the brain inside your skull rather then the one between your legs and there are pills the person could take prier that is why strict laws on this type of issue could prevent this sort of thing . there is also a chance you may never be able to have another child again ,0
1210,the child does have underdeveloped body parts when it is a fetus that is what makes it fetus in the first place a fetus is an underdeveloped human inside of a mother . fetus does have human instincts like any animal it has a preset amount of knowledge so it can live . people who say this is a womans rights issue is wrong it is a childs right issue because i was taught that a strong man stands up for himself a stronger man stands up for those who can not defend themselves ,0
1211,so the definition of child in merriam webster is a son or daughter of a human parents where do you think fetus came from ,0
1212,another argument against abortion is that since a cell in the human body has human dna and is alive and because it is okay to kill it therefore it makes no difference to kill the cells of a fetus . the argument about the personhood of the fetus is very flawed since the people who make the claims have not really thought about what a person really is . for example people say that these aliens would have the morality of a human the same functions of a human unlike a real alien and etc . and if a person were to choose the embryos that does not make the child non human . many people would recognize that the fetus is a human but would deny that the fetus is a person . a fertilized egg has the nature of a whole human being which is not the case for a skin cell which only has the nature of skin . as for the argument about people only having a negative right to life this also just isn t true . the united states has always recognized that the life of any human is valuable . then there is an argument about humans only having a negative right to life which means that that humans do not have a moral obligation to keep other humans alive . so your decisions to save the son over the others does not make the others non human or less vauable . my argument abortion should not be legal because the fetus is human and therefore has the right to life . the very nature of the human is what makes a human being valuable . the people who say this say that a person is someone who has moral consideration as opposed to someone who is human by nature . not only does it presuppose the existence of aliens but the people who make this argument actually give human attributes to aliens making the aliens huaman . our society also does not see it as an unjust burden to demand that people do not murder each other . a person is not valuable because of their thoughts feelings or etc . basically it is obvious that being human in nature means to have a positive right to life ,0
1213,i do not see where you get the stats you claim from that link . given your propensity to make up things as in your first post i would not be surprised if you are stretching the truth of what you found in your second post . as of now i concede the argument and you win ,0
1214,abortion the use or prescription of any instrument medicine drug or any other substance or device intentionally to terminate the pregnancy of a female known to be pregnant with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth to preserve the life or health of the child after live birth or to remove an ectopic pregnancy or the products from a spontaneous miscarriage . d after parental consent is withheld the minor may go to a court of jurisdiction and request to over turn of the parental wishes . argument prior to performing an abortion on a minor medial practitioners must give parental notification and get parental consent excluding the exceptions outlined below exceptions a where incest is claimed by the minor at which time a court must be consulted and approve abortion w o parental notification ,0
1215,finally as those who are having late partial birth abortions are likely to be suicidal or at least will be very determined to get rid of their child they are the most likely to resort to back street methods that because damage to themselves ,1
1216,why does this warrant the forced pregnancy of the mother especially if she was raped and is under  ,1
1218,minister ruled out a ban on amniocentesis saying that it was for the people to change their attitude to female children . rising demand for sex work and trafficking networks since the presence of a woman will improve the status of a household she will become an asset which will be protected even more than now by the family .  female infanticide this does not help your case in any way i strongly disagree . first of all let us look at the reasons that forced the government to illegalize ssa this statement is misleading because the following paragraph illustrated the circumstances in which the law was passed as opposed to a reason .  proper care at the same time a far more common method is simply neglecting a girl child a passive strategy intended to deprive girls of fair access to and share of household resources with reduced survival probability as a consequence . since women from the weakest classes will essentially be marrying into a higher class a married woman would gain an improved access to resources . the divide between rich and poor would increase can you explain this .  a newborn female then has better mating prospects than a newborn male and therefore can expect to have more offspring . i will repost the remaining in my  round if i have space . the women opting for ssa are not responsible for these crimes . any law which legalizes ssa must take care to ensure that there is explicit consent of the woman . islam allowed men to have up to  wives this was the direct consequence of wars which resulted in large decreases in male population . there will probably result in a greater crime rates for the crimes prostitution rackets kidnapping sexual violence which you mentioned . you are unfairly placing the burden on the couples that have a child of a specific gender . my opponent s source further bolsters my point in addition there is a risk that stronger enforcement of the ban on sex determination and sex selective abortions would risk endangering access to reproductive health services potentially driving abortion users underground . if women want to make a correction they can make this correction by actively discriminating during marriage against those communities the states of punjab and haryana have the worst sex ratios which are practicing female foeticide infanticide . also those men who are likely to commit acts of gender based violence would simply become extinct their acts of violence would result from their inability to find a mate .  therefore parents genetically disposed to produce females tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them . wars result in a decrease in the male population ,1
1219,are you really denying the woman a choice of what happens to her own body . i believe what you fail to comprehend is while you continue on to praise about life and ect humans are not the only life on earth . truth be told what if the parents of the child was actually having protected sex but with the only problem being that the protection let say was broken or so . so until a day where all war stops that is when i believe you would have the right to say that we should stop abortion mean whilst i doubt you have the right to continue on praising life . so let me ask you do you really want a child to be raised up by parents that are not even there . if women are not allowed to abort an unwanted foetus they are deprived of this right . with that statement it is still abortion and you even claimed that ,1
1220,if they are unfit to become parents or would birth a child into an unhealthy environment it is inhumane to force a woman to waste the gift of life if it would only harm the future child . if a woman comes to the difficult and emotionally straining decision to terminate a fetus hardly the size of half of a fist you must believe that is in her and the babys best interest . if the two people were using a means of contraception or birth control that did not work they clearly were already trying to prevent this from happening and should not be punished by being forced to carry the baby ,1
1221,in essence if a man hits a woman in the womb and kills the fetus regardless of the stage he will be tried for not one but possibly two accounts of murder depending on the mothers health . if a defected fetus is kept and born into the world the fetus is already developed into a child who is carrying a bad pool of genes waiting to be released into our civilization which will halt the formation of a more improved human race . they cannot have a life worth living because they are not happy or not aware of living . i do not live in the you s i live in australia where abortion is not considered as feticide . because giving birth would jeopardize the  years old girls life and if you still insist that she should not have an abortion anyway because you believe abortion is a crime knowing the risk then you are feigning ignorance to that girls well being . another classic contradiction is if a fetus survives the abortion it is then considered a human life and people have to try to save its life under the born alive infants act . the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime . when a man is raped he may suffer mental damage . if abortion was a crime then she would be criminalized just because she does not want to risk her life . this is because the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime . even a doctor someone who has to oblige laws and regulations would advise her to get an abortion . their families also will be absolutely devastated because now that they have memories of their children it is more painful for them to die as a human being than die as a fetus . and to the contrary i would argue men were seen as tools to a higher degree than that of women . my opponent argued that men were seen as tools to a higher degree than that of a woman e g vast majority of death in war . the fetus under the law in this regard is considered a living human being and is granted the protections of humans . i agree that if a man causes grievous bodily harm to a woman example provided by my opponent as seen above he should be charged with the crime that he has made . they are also constantly in pain due to the diseases that were already imprinted on them since they were in the womb . negative rebuttals then two points on individual aspect of his her argument . then she is advised by the doctor to get an abortion to avoid putting herself at risk . ladies and gentlemen as a debater on the affirmative side i strongly believe that abortion should not be a crime . at  years old she can not have the life experience motherhood needs nor the physical ability to carry out a difficult labor . would you argue that an unborn fetus not yet a real human being should be kept despite that its existence will no doubt kill or greatly damage its mother a very real living human being . round  affirmative rebuttals then two points on the individual aspect of his her argument ,0
1223,this is due to a variety of reasons  we do not know the reason for a womans choice  the illegal nature of abortions endangers women  there are better ways to reduce the amount of abortions in society i do not believe that government should have any say in a womans choice . i believe that every human life should have the chance to become a beautiful human being and if my girlfriend was ever impregnated i would do everything in my power to preserve the life of my child . this way our society can lessen the amounts of abortion without putting the lives and bodies of women at risk and making them criminals . by making it illegal women would be forced to go to unregulated and shady doctors for the procedure . that being said i still respect others choice to get an abortion ,1
1224,yes you are right about the whole underage sex rape etc ,0
1225,to keep things even with my worthy opponent this is his first time after all i will keep my opening statement brief as well ,0
1226,are not you going to counter argue ,0
1227,when the baby is born it still needs to be protected and cared for just like the unborn . since the unborn are humans that are innocent of crime why is there killing not murder . the baby is physically the same in and out of the womb so how is abortion not murder ,0
1228,was an egg that cracked a chicken that died or an egg that never hatched ,1
1229,heres a brief outline of the debate round  acceptances and definitions round   debating rounds arguments and rebuttals round  summaries rebuttals are allowed by no new arguments are permitted some basic rules no personal attackings no use of abusive language no forfeiting getting onto some definitions abortion the elimination of a foetus during pregnancy ,0
1230,then you posted on the account that does best by the critic of abortions own standards the fetus acquires the right to life that you and i have when it begins to have conscious desires ,0
1231,i ask my opponent to not refute my rebuttal as since there will be only one round for rebuttals i cannot make a counter rebuttal . the term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy . violations of these rules may result in the loss of conduct points ,0
1232,yes she is right of the amendment and yes we would not be alive to live in the world but still it may be legal but is it the right thing to do . my oppenent is also correct when she sais it is not murder because the baby was not born . we forget so many times that the amendment was written as guide lines and not laws ,0
1233,you essentially claim that the good of the self is what makes natural morality i say that this proves you have a misunderstanding of what morality traditionally means and probably lack any understanding of contemporary evolutionary theory on the matter .  the babes in question ought not be treated as persons and your lack of demonstration of such reasons their extermination ought logically to be as abhorrent as was that perpetrated by hitler . behavior is extremely regular there is logical evolutionary benefit there is strong evidence to call behavior natural if you look to my argument that human rights are products of our natural qualities you will see that it is logical and based off of premises which are evident that is that reason feeling and interaction are natural qualities of people . correction i did not say emotional feeling and reason develop but that the rights do human rights of which i speak . however those that do not are felt to be abhorrent and immoral by people who have a full knowledge of the facts that is including knowledge that there is no reason to think of jews gays etc as sub human being that as i stated in arg ,0
1234,so here is the logical point if rights and freedoms are such that we can not force the billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few millions to save thinking feeling self aware humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily rights and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos . the reason most of do not compare the killings of the usa army to nazi germany is that we realize there are morally relevant factors that apply or do not apply to different situations and thus one situation even though they may have some things in common even killing does not necessarily mean they are morally equivalent . more than  of all abortions are simply done by women who do not want to live with the consequences of their actions . when the nazis killed millions of jews it was not because it was necessary to maintain bodily rights of the kind as argued for in the violinist analogy . the point is not even the pro life anti choicer believes in such a simplistic absolute right to life and if such a person was to selectively apply such an absolute right to life to justify denying an abortion would be a double standard hypocritical . life is precious therefore women can not have an abortion and for the purposes of this debate can not have an abortion in the embryonic period is a huge leap . if con finds the numbers to high for their liking there are things that have being shown to lower abortion rates which do not require forcing women to continue pregnancy those things fit under the umbrella term more commonly known as the empowerment of women . i maintain this is best explained because such things as self awareness intelligence ability to feel pain are the factors rightly one should take into consideration . i reject even the slightest hint that forced continuation of pregnancy is justified because to allow abortion means a pregnant woman is getting away with something and thus to ensure that such a woman does not get away with what ever it is you think she is getting away with forced continuation of pregnancy is assumed justified . con also did not seem to dispute we should recognize self aware intelligent aliens as persons using such a criteria . for example sex education for women and by sex education i mean real sex education not say an abstinence only sex agenda that deliberately withholds vital information within the subject area ,1
1235,that is over three quarters of the uk population including both men and women ,1
1236,I have already spoken at length about how the trauma of being forced to carry the child could harm the rape victim many times more than the rape itself . in the cases where the birth of the child would because immense suffering or death to othersthis scenario pertains the the debate as it is another example of a situation in which abortion is moral . i agree with my opp that cognitive behavioural therapy cbt is a great and proven method of dealing with post traumatic stress disorder and is often used with both war veterans and rape victims to help them heal from the trauma they have experienced . if she loses the battle and he gets custody then for the rest of her life her rapist could intrude into her life at his whim . the lack of control and hopelessness of ever having freedom would and does force many to suicide . you are then forced into a lengthy and expensive court battle to try and get the child into adoption . in those societies in those times if a parent truly believed that the birth of their child would bring suffering or death to others then i assert that it was moral for them to abort the child . namely a abortion does not change the fact that the rape happened however not having the abortion continues to traumatize the rape victim daily for months or years potentially harming the woman exponentially more than the rape act itself . if a mothers children or loved ones were being held hostage and the hostage taker threatened to kill them all unless she aborted the baby she was carrying then i do not believe it would be wrong of her to abort her child to save those she loved ,1
1237,there is no doubt that a society can make statutory laws to define how the government will protect life . using statutory law principles here for a moment the act of commission in consensual sex in rape the act of commission rests with the rapist took place completely at the behest of the woman . a miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy in the first  weeks sometimes referred to spontaneous abortion in medical journals why do they occur . counter to   inevitability with all due respect to pianosandwich arguing that unintentional miscarriages that a human does not have control over can somehow be used to justify a deliberate termination of human life abortion is to completely eliminate the divide between natural forces and deliberate human interference . otherwise a law becomes simply a set of ideals that humans can choose to ignore at their pleasure . between  and  of first trimester miscarriages normally are the result of chromosomal abnormalities in the egg other reasons may include an egg that didn t implant properly in the uterus or an embryo that had structural defects . response to  personhood pianosandwich with the utmost respect i must point out that pianosandwich made a critical mistake in regard to the natural right to life in his counter . she can only follow the advice of her doctors to ensure the most successful pregnancy possible . according to the encyclopedia britannica natural law is defined as follows regardless of the statues that a society can pass natural law applies to every form of human life ,0
1238,keep it civil ,0
1239,and we will not face any danger by doing this obviously far more mothers choose to keep their child than choose abortion . if they are in danger or the child is it should be provided as more like a sort of mercy kill both of them would die the other way . no one is saying that the mothers are forced to choose abortion but if either one of them are in danger it is the better choice ,1
1240,nevertheless i proceed with the assumption that my opponent claims that a fetus in the womb is a living human being because it feels pain eats and drinks like us . the capacity of a human fetus to feel pain eat and drink greatly depends on its development . a fetus during an earlier stage of the pregnancy does not feel pain eat or drink in the same manner and magnitude as a fetus in a later stage ,1
1241,on the off chance that your ability to listen to reasoned is not impaired debate i will recommend some links to some videos that might help to change your opinion to your point about fetuses not being human two human people had sexual intercourse to produce this child so it would be denying a science fact that this is not human offspring this is a quote from your last post on this debate while i concede that life does begin at conception life is not equal to human life . this is a quote from you this is your definition of a man woman or child of the species homo sapiens distinguished from other animals by superior mental development power of articulate speech and upright stance . while i concede that life does begin at conception life is not equal to human life this is a quote from your last post which completely destroys your own argument ,0
1243,i thank my opponent for this challenge and look forward to a lively debate . the government is not responsible or trustworthy enough to make decisions like this on an individuals behalf . there is a substantial chance that the child will grow up in a poor environment . my opponent states that killing a human life is murder . for this reason i believe the onus is on my opponent to prove not that abortion is killing but that this particular form of killing is wrong and why ,1
1244,thus the only reason to have an abortion in that frame of time is because the woman does not want to have the responsibility of raising a child . there is no way of knowing if the baby has a health defect or if the pregnancy and consequent birth will be a problem for the mother . she would have to be in the same mindframe as the girls who sued mcdonalds for ,0
1246,the law is justified in those late term cases and here too in not extending absolute right . the law i am contending just does not go far enough it does not require the baby to be removed safely if possible . no one has an absolute right to kill someone just because tehy are on their property etc ,0
1247,now a few quotes to combat this exhibit from scholarly sources compared to states that support women s health those states that oppose safe and legal abortion spend far less money per child on a range of services such as foster care education welfare and the adoption of children who have physical and mental disabilities schroedel  .  about half of all pregnancies in the you s each year are unintended and four in  of these are ended by medically safe legal abortions . however if the terrorist as terrorists often do forced his or her way into the space station and used violence to place this bomb in joes hand surely it would not be fair to force him to die over this . this example would perhaps be applicable if joe invited the terrorist over for dinner a game of chess and to watch breaking bad . can not the same be said for the all the sperm that do not fertilize a given egg . today  percent of the abortions in the you s are provided to women over  and to teenagers cdc  .  the states that have the strongest laws against safe and legal abortion are also the states in which women suffer from lower levels of education and higher levels of poverty as well as from a lower ratio of female tomale earnings ,0
1248,considering that your life is merely an extension of the one inside your mothers womb does not your life still have that same worth . perhaps for the sake of your own mother but it does not mean your life is worth less or nothing at all . your lifes value does not drop to zero based solely on the fact that you were not intended ,0
1249,under my opponents logic everyone should be having sexual intercourse as often as possible that way in a few months a baby would be born . i mean if everyone who could create a baby was having intercourse then we would have a ton of babies in just about nine months . if someone did not wear a condom during intercourse then a baby would potentially be born in a few months . should someone not wear a condom for the same reason . a life will thus never considered as such until at the very least after birth ,1
1250,in certain situations abortion is appropriate but if they are so young and its not rape its there own fault ,0
1251,i accept good luck and may the best debater win ,1
1252,conduct no rounds are dropped but i think it is clear from the quality of the debate the argumentation and the spelling and grammar that the pro made a mockery of this debate . as a last ditch effort the pro attempts to characterize thomsons burglar analogy as faulty by saying that leaving a door open in a dangerous neighborhood is not tantamount the act of having sex . this seems like the kind of plan that one would submit for decriminalizing marijuana or drugs or some other practice that is already against the law . primarily we must see that there really is no such thing as a passive action . on this rather bizarre argument from the pro that if there is an accident that attaches a victim to a wrong doers body no would would argue that the wrong doer should kill the innocent victim . to quickly address the bop argmentation there is nothing that the pro has provided that really substantially answers the question of why we should accept this rather vague notion that it should be illegal to have an abortion during the first tri mester but that this law should not be pursued . the pro provides no solid reasoning as to why we should accept this resolution . there is no formalized argumentation and the bop is not upheld . my point here is that throughout the argumentation you have been presented with there is really no substantiation as to why we should follow this sort of plan . however even if you do not buy this distinction the pro does not argue how this negates the idea that a fetus does not posses rights to its mothers body . however if we further look at this point the act of leavingt ones door open is active ,1
1253,the baby has his or her body torn to pieces in most abortion methods and that can because pain to mother and child . if a woman does not want a baby there are many contraceptive methods out there . a lot of the abortion methods are harmful to the mother and baby ,0
1254,none of this evidence follows or aligns with almost any other scientific research done on this subject while a fetus may be a life it does not start to develop characters that humans share until around   weeks . so if we took pros stance and actually considered the fetus a human we are promised by law the right to terminate it if it could endanger the mothers life . even recent studies show that pregnancy is actually more fatal now than it was years ago the maternal death rate in the you s is creeping upward to more than double what it was  years ago . the next logical question one may ask is whether or not it is a human life . i would almost argue for the fact that the fetus would have to exhibit pain feelings emotion and conscious . my adversary will surely spend some of his her allotted words on presenting the fact that a fetus is a life at conception . i think this exhibits some flaws in logic because the next logical step that my adversary would take is that killing this person or baby after the time it was conceived would be murder . this is a difficult circumstance to be put in but with the child having no way to respond in both situations the only viable way to judge this is let the parents decide . i am not going to spend much time on this because it is overall irrelevant to some of the points i will be making . justifiable homicide rightful warranted or sanctioned by law that which can be shown to be sustained by lawwe are also by law promised the right to act in self defense . if this is an early term pregnancy and we know for a fact that if the pregnancy continued the mother would die . there is a big problem with this and it is cited and acknowledged by multiple people a if the pregnancy continues the mother will die . imagine if you are with a girl for  years and at the age of  she encounters this situation . these are just a few facts on how many pregnancies can be fatal .  anand argues that because fetuses can respond to stress or other stimuli at  weeks abortion after that point causes them .  a a fetus is a life and it was conceived by a human therefore the fetus is a person or a baby . contention  in cases where it could danger a mother s lifefor the sake of argument let us say that a fetus is in fact a living breathing person and acting on abortion is committing murder ,1
1256,i think abortion is bad only within certain circumstances thus i also think abortion can be ok or even good ,1
1257,although i do not have time to supply evidence to this claim i can supply it next time as i know many examples of this happening but this consent argument is very strong the only problem is people on both parties often consent but then regret their decision later . i will not bother responding to the rest of this point as i am pretty sure it is entirely based on who can win the second point please correct me if i am wrong . while you use a very philosophical argument i would like to use science and then explain why your argument is not as credible . if you do not think human life exists at fertilization please tell me where you think it begins and why . there is no point in spending too much time on this as this point depends almost entirely on your second point so I will make it brief . i also agree with your pre rebuttal both parties do have to have consent but sometimes the opportunity in the abortion industry does lure in doctors who later regret their decisions . this is a very flawed analogy as it would mean people in comas are dead as well as people suffering from severe types of brain damage among many others ,0
1258,if you have no reason for it to be illegal . for something to be considered  something must follow . it is also very humble of you to accepted that it is not illegal ,1
1259,but let us say the mans choice is to terminate and the womans choice is to keep ,0
1260,i extend my arguments ,1
1261,a baby the most innocent harmless thing in the world brutally killed after surviving an attempted murder . this would be extremely immoral and goes against all of our human rights after all what is the difference between the ways that a baby who has survived an abortion and a serial killer are treated . each person is destined to do something great in their lives and what is different about this baby amongst millions of others ,0
1262,if you can not negate those then the womans bodily rights can not prove superior to the life of the child . i should have stated clearer that i do not wish to debate the issue of life early in the pregnancy . it is not like she was just laying there not engaging in sex and a fetus suddenly attached itself to the mother . she assumed the risk of getting pregnant by having sex so at least later in pregnancy it is a fact we have to consider . also she also did not abort when it was morally grayer earlier in pregnancy so she assumed the fact of being pregnant if an exception does not apply . most who comment on this debate say it is unfair by me because the latitude made almost on one agrees in absolute terms that the mother should be able to abort any time she wants . if you caused an accident and caused someone to be dependent on you in general or physically attached to you and you could not separate the people for a number of months no one who can be taken seriously would say the person who caused the accident can just kill the victim ,0
1263,looking forward to a good debate ,0
1264,the medical termination of pregnancy act  permits abortion to be performed only when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health or when there is a substantial risk of the child being born with physical or mental abnormalities so as to be seriously handicapped . it is legal only when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health or when there is a substantial risk of the child being born with physical or mental abnormalities so as to be seriously handicapped . increased pressure to marry the society as a whole adjusts to the conditions following every change . it will reinforce the gender prejudices and people would cash in on these and there would be no way for the government to check these because they would not breaking any law . any law which legalizes ssa must take care to ensure that there is explicit consent of the woman . the reason why the woman opting for ssa should not be allowed was stated as freedom of choice should not be executed when it harms someone and that it makes the love for the child conditional . wars yes the mating prospects would increase but that would not lead to an increase in status instead it will result in declining status which is what i predicted in the previous argument since there would be a simultaneous increase in the pressure to marry coupled with decreasing demographic representation . once a girl is married into the family the respect is uniform . a parent who perfects his child is bound to show a greater control and expect a lot more from his child putting him under undue pressure . the status would not increase instead a steady decline in the role of the wife would start . with a large number of males as compared to females the pressure would translate into a societal norm .  this statement is misleading though this does not affect the argument that much the circumstances were the reasons that created a pressing demand for illegalizing ssa . i do not see a drastic change in the amount of respect given to a wife no matter the ratio of males to females . i e it does not allow the parent to discard the child as long as it does not infringe on the personal health of the mother or the child . the divide between rich and poor would increase can you explain this . and during a time when there would be even more demand for the services the prostitution market would flourish .  since the presence of a woman will improve the status of a household she will become an asset which will be protected even more than now by the family . the argument pointed out that the social structure of india is not favourable for legalizing ssa . the men might be more willing but the women holding the right to mate would have pretty large choice from the male members of the same caste ,0
1265, new york city department of health and mental hygiene nyc gov february.  for these reasons abortion is bad and should not be allowed .  abortion takes away from the unborn the unalienable right to life that the founding fathers intended for all human beings . the federal unborn victims of violence act which was enacted states that under federal law anybody intentionally killing or attempting to kill an unborn child should be punished . allowing abortion conflicts with the unalienable right to life recognized by the founding fathers of the united states ,0
1266,our daughter kaitlyn was born healthy and beautiful on march   and we love her to pieces . if judy nicastro hadn t had her abortion the baby would have had a miserable life that probably would have ended in a painful death as hard as it was for the mother she had to make the right decision to let her baby die in very little to no pain in a warm and loving place . once we had all the data we met with a nurse a surgeon and a pediatrician at the hospital . i would also appreciate it if you would stop addressing me as a man because i am actually a woman but i hope this news does not like your views on a woman s right to do what she finds right with her body make you believe my female opinion is no longer valid . i share my story in the hope that our leaders will be more responsible and compassionate when they weigh what it means to truly value the lives of women and children . the next day at a clinic near my home i felt my son s budding life end as a doctor inserted a needle through my belly into his tiny heart . i would like to start by saying that my english was perfectly clear just more refined and poetic than the average debate . but to put it simpler the government doesns past present or future or what may happen if the baby is born for all they know the mother was raped the mother has a deadly illness the baby could have a horribly painful life ending in a painful death or the mother and the baby could both die if the baby is born . and according to the law choosing to save the mother s life instead of the babys is a perfectly valid excuse for an abortion . if you think that these questions do not matter and that all that matters to you is your life than you clearly have not yet matured enough to develop enough empathy to be able to truly understand the decision your mother has to make . they said i needed an m r i which would provide more details . i will tell you why it s a story the autobiography of the twenty three unbearable weeks of a loving mother . also responding to what you said earlier that a mother cannot know what the baby wants you are partly correct the mother doesn t know what the baby would think is right which is why she needs to make the decisions for it . and it was difficult but as the great kenneth parcel once said and like the  people out of  that commented that this story i think the mother did the right thing i hope that you can see that too . they will not know if their mother s life could have been happier if her career could have been more fulfilling or if she could have waited longer and married someone that would have made her happier and she could have had an all around happier life and a happier family . but although children have brain activity at about  weeks old they certainly dons best for they wondo you think your mother made the right choice by having you . my debate partner says well i believe that it is wrong to force a child not to live . last time i checked i would not be very happy if my mom aborted me as i would not get the chance to live and experience life . i also dearly hope this changes your mind about what you said earlier that because really the decision should only be up to the mother ,1
1267,if you are conservative against gun control and if you are also against abortion because we need to protect the innocent . if a woman is raped and gets pregnant she should not have to bear that child as a constant reminder of that tragedy . yes but if the parents do not tell them early it could be mentally scaring also if they do not get adopted they will go into the foster system or an orphanage not sure which of those two is worth . it is murder is the killing taking of ones life another person or life form taking of ones life implies that the person must be alive . i will start by debunking the most common arguments against abortion reason rebutted  . if so why are you against gun control  or more of gun death in america are innocent children . it is unconstitutional because of life liberty and the pursuit happiness the other ones liberty and the pursuit of happiness say that a person may do whatever they choose in the pursuit of happiness ,1
1269,con must present reasons for why adoption is the solution to abortion . adoption to take into ones family through legal mean and raise as ones own child . note this is not a pro life or anti abortion vs pro choice argument ,0
1270, it is unfair for a rape victim to have her life disabled by an unwanted or uncontrollable pregnancy . any subjective religious concerns regarding the soul would need to be left at the door in order to maintain separation of church and state in the us at least . I am not necessarily pro abortion I am rather somewhere in the middle but it sounded like an interesting topic ,1
1271,she may even be spiteful that she is being forced into carrying an unwanted child for  months . the only other argument i can foresee you mentioning is that the child could be given up for adoption directly after being born to a mother that does not care . if the woman is as promiscuous as your initial argument makes out she may end up giving birth to many kids that she never wanted many kids that are neglected and raised in an environment of regret a home completely void of love . although this would be great news to thousands of adoptive parents i can not see it being a straight forward procedure . you may argue that aborting a life is equally as cruel as birthing them in an unsavoury environment but i strongly believe that an early abortion is not morally wrong in any sense because the embryo has not developed a brain or nervous system to think about or even feel what is happening ,1
1273,our brain is what makes us capable of reasoning is what makes us humans in the first place . on balance as far as it is before the development previously explained abortion is not killing a human thus it is not wrong . by messing with a life aren .  the thalamo cortical complex that provides consciousness with its highly elaborate content begins to be in place between the  and  week of gestation . i mean the risk of being incapable of having a baby exists but is pretty little compared to the risk caused by other daily activities we do us alcohol tobacco and others . what enables us to unlock the capacity of reasoning . humans can be aware they are capable of reasoning and philosophizing ,1
1274, this leads me to my third reason the simple fact of the matter is one cannot prevent a women from getting an abortion for if a women decides for herself that an abortion is the only route to take nothing can stop her from terminating her pregnancy . people who deny women their right to late term abortions provoke patriarchal tendencies by which men have all the say in a countrys doings and diminish the rights of women . if such is the case rest assured it is then would not it make sense to give women the safest option possible an abortion ,1
1275,should we really be forcing women who are not ready to be a mother ,1
1276, contra positive obligations again pro offers no proof whatsoever for his conclusion that children are entitled to something so i could counter that point just be saying no they do not . this is an issue that is brought up in the first few pages of every basic ethics book and yet frequently overlooked by those who understand the finer points inside and out . introduction trents argument is well presented and he defends his points rigorously but he is off the mark on what the resolution asks for . however i do not accept that the right to life is included among these rights and that was not a requirement . my detailed analysis of what rights human beings have which does not include a positive right to life greatly outweighs pros unsupported assertion . pro after all is the one trying to establish a normative claim that abortion is immoral given our assumptions and he has offered no normative analysis . these restraints on behavior can be called moral rules if morality is to have any meaning it is the rules which constrain our actions toward one another . in my affirmative i made an argument against the possibility of positive rights which i will defend in my closing argument . i invite the audience to reread pros  in his own words he does not argue that humans have a right to life he only argues that humans at all stages of development have the same rights . no positive right to life was established in the affirmative arguments of this debate and i was the only one who defended any rights at all negative rights . I will go through his premises and conclusions and give my criticisms then offer my own points in response . i established in my affirmative argument that it is justifiable to use force to end a rights violation a contention i will defend in my closing . once again his argument is very strong but not relevant to affirming the resolution we have already assumed this premise ,1
1277,my opponent calls this vigilantism however we are talking about defense not justice . however my opponent has himself admitted taking a life is not the same as murder . my opponent ignores every poll presented in the group of polls that shows a majority believing that abortion is in fact murder and concentrates on the only one that where less than  call it murder but a vast majority still consider it the taking of a human life . justice is the sole province of god and government defense is a moral right and duty . my opponent declares while completely missing the point that abortion itself is the taking of a human life without a trial ,0
1278,and the last reason it should be illegal in principal is because the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy . the common arguments in favor of abortion should be used here as holistic approach to why she should be able to decide given the various moral considerations involved . the pro and con about human life here are enough to say in principle we should defer to human life but not clear enough to make any meaningful punishments for it . but on the other hand the earliest cell does meet the requirements for what would constitute an organism albeit it would probably be viewed as more like a parasitic organism given it must live off of the mother .  aside from rape and mothers health abortion should be illegal in the first trimester but not investigated nor punished . i would take that same reasoning though and argue that it is such a strong consideration that it should at least be illegal albeit with no legal consequences . while the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy she may have tried her best not to get pregnant and got pregnant anyways ,0
1279,that is my religious belief and it may not be yours which is wonderful that there is diversity . I am sure that people who were not concieved as a result of rape have also commited suicide which flaws this argument . you say that the woman actually does have every right and while this is a pretty bold statement you provide absolutely no evidence to why this is and you cite no sources why she should be able to ,0
1280,in other words people do not solely engage in sex just to have children so the reproductive correlation of sex is not the only aspect to be taken into consideration for this debate in terms of analysis or definitions . since he cannot prove that people always have sex for the purpose of getting pregnant then he cannot say that we I am using this pronoun for the purpose of the analogy entered an agreement mutually to buy a pet . pro says that if two consenting adults choose to have sex when the goal is not for reproduction that they are engaging in this activity for the reasons . in order for his analogy to work he would have to prove that the people in question mother and father had sex solely for the purpose of pregnancy . the average risk of death during pregnancy is less than  in the united states . this agreement is all fine and dandy unless my dog does not produce the puppies at all for whatever reason . a perfect example of this would be the statement no matter what con says about this child his age will have not changed . we agree to have our dogs mate and then share custody of the puppies or rights over the puppies in the sense that we can share the profits of selling them etc .  but if your dog did become pregnant with the puppies and you decided to have a that would be in clear violation of the contract because it would violate my right over those puppies which i have via the contract sex . a fetus is actually composed of living matter matter that belongs to the father as much as it does to the mother .  second assuming that i would actually accept the analogy that the dog represents the fetus in this case the analogy still fails on the basis that a dog is a living entity outside of myself or my opponent . note that this is entirely subjective and rooted in opinion without any factual basis whatsoever . no matter how much people distort the meaning purpose of sex its definition does not change . if a contraceptive were used properly than this would not be an issue .  but we have already said in the resolution that the mothers health and therefore body does not have a bearing because this is a ,0
1281,should the woman go through with an abortion or can the man wave parental and financial responsibility ,0
1282,i end this debate by pointing out that pro has largely failed to counter my arguments and has made little effort to truly refute my counters . after this i went on to mention the final poll as it is the one referenced when pro stated most people thought abortion was murder . preface as this is the final round i shall not make any cases rather i shall make only counter cases . he has largely made his points through use of unapologetic semantics play and misrepresentation of my own arguments .   it in no way reference a which I have in a prior round pointed out is a dangerous and possibly hypocritical concept when used to justify violence . counter case iv shifting the goal post this is a small point and thus will not be a long counter case however i feel i should give it it is own place simply to emphasis the point . pro starts by attempting to say that i ignored all of his polls except for the one where murder is less . so the changing from murder to maiming does not alter the validity of my cases . but in the real world you get a trial no matter what you have done . pro has failed to counter me usually dropping cases and failed to defend his points . near the end pro attempted to shift the goal post to discredit my arguments . ultimately as pro fails to mention any other ones i cannot explain them as each example would be obviously different . counter case iii semantics pro starts his final paragraph by attempting to discredit me through the use of simple semantics ,1
1284,however you did not reject my point that abortion is murder you merely are arguing that it should be legal in the case of rape . however there is no reason that being pregnant should distract the girl from learning which is the main purpose of school . your other point is that she and others will not think of the rape as much if she were to get an abortion and not be pregnant ,0
1285,and in my initial post i stipulated very clearly that abortion a week before the due date was okay i even went insofar as saying an abortion a day before a due date was okay . then i pose this question what makes an abortion namely a late term abortion so morally unjust . in reality the few late term abortionists in the united states utilize the technique mold standing for four drugs misoprostol oxytocin laminaria and digoxin that are injected into a fetus throughout the course of several days . when late term abortions are attacked as vehemently as they are in the united states i encourage you to look into the murder of late term abortionist george tiller women will do what they need to do to terminate their pregnancy . let me start by assuring you that i am indeed a clinically sane person . as i stated in my previous argument women who need abortions will stop at no lengths to get one . therefore it only makes sense to make sure these abortions are performed in such a professional manner that the fetus does not feel pain and that a woman does not harm herself in trying to perform her own abortion ,1
1286,abortions also occur when the mothers life is in danger . so it is plainly obvious that in addition to physical differences between the two there is a distinct philosophical difference between the two based on the intent and reasoning used to perform the acts which conversely creates a divergence in the morality of the two . abortions are done because the mother does not want the fetus inside of her living in her . death from gunfire can be the result of bleeding out from a wound the loss of critical organs such as the brain heart or lungs seizure from shock ect . the method by which gun crimes and abortion occur are entirely different ,1
1287, if con has a problem with any rule it will be resolved in the comments section so that we do not wast the debate arguing about rules any accusations of a logical fallacy must be supported follow basic rules of debating politeness happy debating . i am arguing that there are certain times when abortion is wrong and should not be done and there are times that it is acceptable .  burden of proof is shared first round is acceptance clarification of position and whatever else con feels necessary but no arguments to make sure that we both have  argument rounds ,1
1288,it can not survive for a day without being inside of the women so this should still be considered her body and should be viewed as a womans choice on what to do with there own body . all the rights a fetus has goes to the mother because in the constitution the  amendment says that something is alive when it is born until then the fetus is part of the womans body . until the fetus is born it is not considered alive by the us constitution ,1
1290,good job great debate ,0
1291,that s not right and its very dangerous to her health and i believe she has to have that authority to make an abortion without doing all those sonograms that will try to convey her to make a decision she does not wanted ,1
1292,definitions explanations early abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy . the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age . medical non surgical abortions using medications such as mifepristone  are available in some clinics ,1
