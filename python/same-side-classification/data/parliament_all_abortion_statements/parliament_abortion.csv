3952,Government,3969402,"it is my pleasure to report on the success of Fredericton-York-Sunbury's latest public consultation meeting held last Sunday. Over 100 participants gathered to debate gender related issues ranging from housing and child care to abortion and same sex spousal benefits.
 This marked the fourth in a series of riding forums since February. The first dealt with health care, the second, national defence and the third, human resources development. I wish to thank my colleagues from Perth-Wellington-Waterloo for participating in the defence forum, from York North for contributing to the HRD debate and from Halifax for input on gender related issues. Thanks also to provincial ministers Russ King,
 Vaughan Blaney and New Brunswick Deputy Premier Marcelle Mersereau for their contributions.

0,Government,3970005,"I commend to the House private member's Bill C-235, an act to amend the Criminal Code relevant to the issue of abortion introduced by the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
 The purpose of the bill is to make it a criminal offence to require a physician, nurse, staff member or employee of a hospital or health facility to perform or participate in an abortion procedure.
 The bill would also make it a criminal offence to discriminate against any of these persons for refusing to perform or participate in an abortion procedure.
 It is time Parliament exercised its jurisdiction to enact legislation to protect and safeguard the rights and life of a child ventre sa mere, the child within the womb.
 Enact legislation now to guarantee the right to life at all stages from the moment of conception until natural death.","['the bill would also make it a criminal offence to discriminate against any of these persons for refusing to perform or participate in an abortion procedure ', 'it is time parliament exercised its jurisdiction to enact legislation to protect and safeguard the rights and life of a child ventre sa mere the child within the womb ', 'the purpose of the bill is to make it a criminal offence to require a physician nurse staff member or employee of a hospital or health facility to perform or participate in an abortion procedure ']",0

 The drug's manufacturer has said it will not apply to test and sell the drug in Canada unless specifically invited to do so. The government has been quoted as saying that it never asks companies to make specific drugs available and will not make an exception for the manufacturer of RU486. Nevertheless the drug is in Canada and is being prescribed to women without legal approval.
 Possession and use of illegal drugs are serious criminal offences and for good reason. The health and safety of Canadians depends, to a large degree, on effective and enforced drug legislation. Criminal law dealing with RU486 should be no exception.

254,Opposition,4007320,"the Canadian medicare system needs an overhaul. We Reformers believe the best way to overhaul a system is through respecting provincial jurisdiction and granting provinces and Canadians choice and flexibility.
 With an Ottawa imposed deadline looming over Alberta, it has been reported that the federal government may now be willing to allow private clinics. What happened to the infamous line in the sand the Minister of Health proclaimed in Victoria? Has she decided to erase it? Why the flip-flop?
 Last week in this House the minister stated: ""To date the Canada Health Act has been extremely flexible in allowing for change within different provinces"". If that is true, why the need for deadlines threatening financial penalties? Based on her statement, I would expect the minister to accept Alberta's decision to deinsure tax funding of abortions.
 The minister cannot have it both ways. Either she will allow for genuine choice and flexibility in the health care system that works for all Canadians or she will continue to adhere to an outdated piece of legislation.","['what happened to the infamous line in the sand the minister of health proclaimed in victoria ', 'either she will allow for genuine choice and flexibility in the health care system that works for all canadians or she will continue to adhere to an outdated piece of legislation ', 'if that is true why the need for deadlines threatening financial penalties ']",2

 We must tell China that this policy is wrong. As Canadian Human Rights Commissioner it is his responsibility to lead, not to follow. He has a moral obligation to help bring about change in areas where the humane treatment of people is rejected. He must do this by showcasing Canada as a model of democratic tolerance, a champion of human rights and a defender of the exploited.
 We cannot sit idly by, as women, children and others suffer abuse at the hands of inhumane governments. Instead of resigning himself to indifference, Max Yalden should resign, himself.

6241,Government,4063308,"here are the disturbing facts surrounding the recent sentencing of three convicted rapists in Montreal. Found guilty of gang raping and sodomizing a pregnant teenager, they were sentenced to two years less a day. The court was told the men held a 17-year old girl captive for more than 12 hours, repeatedly assaulted her, and at one point dangled her over an apartment balcony to deter her from reporting the incident. One of the rapists was the father of the victim's unborn child, a gruesome circumstance which apparently prompted her to have an abortion.
 In announcing the sentence the judge said the crown attorney's recommendation for prison terms of 10 to 12 years was grossly exaggerated. He also said that while the rapists' actions were deplorable, the victim had no signs of provable violence.
 In my opinion there is no such thing as a non-violent rape. There is no such thing as torture without pain.

2,Opposition,4075226,"a million babies, give or take a few, have lost their lives in the last 10 years. Is parliament horrified? No. Is the media in an uproar for the government to do something? No.
 Thanks to the Supreme Court of Canada and weak-kneed politicians, Canada has been without any restrictions on abortion for 10 years. Not only are there no restrictions when a woman can get an abortion between the time of conception and until the baby emerges alive from the birth canal, but the government has forced taxpayers to pay for the killing of these one million babies.
 I have introduced a motion that would at least put a stop to government funding for abortions, a measure which two-thirds of Canadians support.
 My private members' Motion No. 268 calls for a binding national referendum at the time of the next election to ask whether or not voters are in favour of government funding for medically unnecessary abortions.
 I urge every member who feels strongly about saving the lives of tens of thousands of helpless infants to support this motion and to help me convince the House to make it votable.","['not only are there no restrictions when a woman can get an abortion between the time of conception and until the baby emerges alive from the birth canal but the government has forced taxpayers to pay for the killing of these one million babies ', ' calls for a binding national referendum at the time of the next election to ask whether or not voters are in favour of government funding for medically unnecessary abortions ', 'is the media in an uproar for the government to do something ']",0
3,Opposition,4089090,"it has been 29 years since abortion was legalized in this country. In those days abortion was used only where a mother's life or health was endangered. But today I think it has gone too far, especially when we see taxpayer funded abortions on demand, increased diagnoses of post-abortion trauma, indication of medical linkages to breast cancer, minors given abortion without parental consent and approximately $50 million spent annually on abortion.
 Not everybody in the Reform caucus or across the country agrees with me. That is why the Reform Party's responsible position is to identify abortion as an issue of personal conscience and supports informed debate and giving people a voice through a national referendum. Canadians should be allowed to examine the facts on all sides of the issue.
 In my opinion, women have a right to know about the risks of abortion and taxpayers should know the cost. For me, if it is about choice, let us give women better choices.","['it has been  years since abortion was legalized in this country ', 'that is why the reform partys responsible position is to identify abortion as an issue of personal conscience and supports informed debate and giving people a voice through a national referendum ', 'in those days abortion was used only where a mothers life or health was endangered ']",0

 One of my constituents, Mrs. Claire Heggtveit of Nepean, is a woman who has dedicated her life and work to the principle of equality.
 Earlier this week Mrs. Heggtveit was one of five women honoured with the 1998 Persons Case Award which recognizes outstanding contributions toward promoting equality for women in Canada.
 As an economist, she was vital in developing a statistical framework during the 1960s and 1970s which aided the federal government in assessing the quality of women's health and socioeconomic status. She also completed a Canadian survey for the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the first national focus on family planning, abortion and divorce.

1,Government,4104828,"in 1948 the World Medical Association adopted a Hippocratic oath to guide the ethical practice of medical doctors. It reads in part:
 I will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception.
 In the early 1970s medical schools stopped requiring new doctors to take the oath and the Canadian Medical Association code of ethics no longer requires any reference to abortion. The medical profession has abandoned its responsibility for the unborn child and now it is up to Canadians to assume that responsibility.
 Last year there were over 110,000 abortions in Canada with a cost to our health care system of over $10 million. That is over 300 abortions each and every day. It says that each year 110,000 mistakes are made at the expense of all Canadians by those who fail to act responsibly.
 Is it too much to ask Canadians just to be responsible for their actions? We do have a choice and that choice should be made before we act, not after we have failed to act responsibly.","['it says that each year   mistakes are made at the expense of all canadians by those who fail to act responsibly ', 'last year there were over   abortions in canada with a cost to our health care system of over  million ', 'it reads in part i will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception ']",0

 The rights of freedom of conscience and religion have long been recognized in Canada. So why has this happened to these nurses? Doctors have the right not to participate in abortion procedures and euthanasia, so why not nurses? This is a genuine instance of discrimination.
 I have introduced to the House Bill C-461 and I would ask my hon. colleagues and this House to support it. The purpose of that particular bill is to ensure that health care providers will never be forced to participate against their will in procedures such as abortion or acts of euthanasia.
 Incredibly there are medical personnel in Canada who have been dismissed because the law is not explicit enough in spelling out their conscience rights.

 In Quebec, it was in 1971 that the first rally related to International Women's Day took place. On that occasion, people marched to allow women to have access to legal and free abortion, as demanded by the Front de libération des femmes.
 In 2002, this day is an opportunity to reflect on the social, economic and political demands of women throughout the world.
 Even though women can now vote and get an abortion, there are still many issues to be raised on March 8 of each year. Ensuring equal pay and decent parental leave, and following up on the demands of the world march of women are all measures that the federal government has refused to take.

 These women want the same standards of informed consent to exist for abortion as are required in other areas of health care. Strong reproductive health policy needs to recognize these concerns.

 Denise Mountenay and Linda Menon are here for the March for Life. These are courageous women who represent a group called Canada Silent No More.

 After a tough 20-year battle led by doctors and women's groups, this ruling finally allowed women to take control of their bodies and their pregnancies and to have access to safe abortion. Since then, they have had the freedom to choose.
 That is why any threat by this Conservative government to limit the right to abortion is a direct affront to women's rights. Bill C-484 by the hon. Conservative member for Edmonton—Sherwood Park opens the door to criminalizing abortion.

 To mark the occasion, I would like to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the decriminalization of abortion. Indeed, on January 28, 1988, in the Morgentaler decision, the Supreme Court declared section 251 of the Criminal Code unconstitutional because it infringed on women's rights to life, liberty and security. 
 This decision helped reduce the number of clandestine abortions, which were causing serious health problems for women, often even leading to women's deaths. Since the Morgentaler case, not a year goes by when the rights of women to exercise autonomy and free will are questioned, jeopardized, limited and even threatened.

 There is a serious gap in the law that allows a criminal to violently take that choice and the child she wants away from her, against her will, without her consent, and with violence.
 People who support this bill understand the difference between a woman who goes to a doctor or clinic and says, “I'm pregnant and I don't want to be.

 What is of concern is how the university reacted. It demanded that the group remove its display and then charged the students when they refused.
 Similar censorship has occurred at universities in Toronto, Calgary, Fredericton and, most recently, Victoria where students are banned from carrying out pro-life activities and were forced to apologize to groups that were offended by their display.

New Democrats will continue Dr. Morgentaler's fight and the pursuit of equality.","['morgentaler was honoured with the order of canada for his tireless efforts for nearly half a century putting his life and freedom at risk so that canadian women could have access to safe abortion services ', 'twenty five years ago the supreme court ruled in his favour declaring that women have the right to choose ', 'we must remain vigilant against repeated attempts to roll back these rights ']",1
16899,Opposition,4578278,"Conservatives showed us this weekend that they are more right wing than ever. Conservatives voted for a less progressive tax system. They voted to attack collective bargaining and reduce public pensions. They rejected any form of any gun control. They even want to reopen the abortion debate by restricting a woman's right to choose. The same proposal was rejected by the House. However, while Conservatives were showing Canadians how right wing they are, missing from the convention was anyone taking any responsibility for any part of the Senate expense scandal.
 When the Prime Minister is losing the credibility war to Mike Duffy and the contrition war to Mayor Rob Ford, we know he has serious problems. Fortunately, in 2015, Canadians will have a real choice: to elect an NDP government to finally clean up Conservative and Liberal corruption once and for all.","['they even want to reopen the abortion debate by restricting a womans right to choose ', 'however while conservatives were showing canadians how right wing they are missing from the convention was anyone taking any responsibility for any part of the senate expense scandal ', 'when the prime minister is losing the credibility war to mike duffy and the contrition war to mayor rob ford we know he has serious problems ']",2
8485,Opposition,4581533,"the Minister of Status of Women appeared before our committee yesterday. It was only the second time that she had come to discuss her department's plans and priorities.
 The NDP asked her about how women's equality has declined since the Conservatives were elected, but the minister did not reply. When we asked her if she plans to launch a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women, she did not reply. 
 When we asked her if she plans to develop a national action plan to address the high rate of violence against women, and why her government has no moral qualms about denying abortion services for victims of war rape and young girls forced into marriage, she did not reply. 
 This week we learned that, in Canada, over half of all single mothers with young children are living below the poverty line. The minister did not once mention child care, pay equity or reducing poverty among Canadian women, who desperately need help.
 Canadian women deserve better.","['the minister did not once mention child care pay equity or reducing poverty among canadian women who desperately need help ', 'the ndp asked her about how womens equality has declined since the conservatives were elected but the minister did not reply ', 'when we asked her if she plans to develop a national action plan to address the high rate of violence against women and why her government has no moral qualms about denying abortion services for victims of war rape and young girls forced into marriage she did not reply ']",1
19883,Opposition,4585518,"on January 28, 1988, the Supreme Court decriminalized abortion in Canada by striking down section 251 of the Criminal Code. Part of the ruling reads as follows:
  Forcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a foetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations, is a profound interference with a woman's body and thus an infringement of security of the person. 
 The right of Canadian women to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term is not a done deal. The Conservatives have introduced three bills as well as Motion No. 312 to eliminate that right. In addition, young Canadian women are facing more and more economic and social uncertainty because the Conservatives are behind the times when it comes to gender equality.
 The NDP believes it is time to take action.","['the right of canadian women to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term is not a done deal ', 'in addition young canadian women are facing more and more economic and social uncertainty because the conservatives are behind the times when it comes to gender equality ', 'part of the ruling reads as follows forcing a woman by threat of criminal sanction to carry a foetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations is a profound interference with a womans body and thus an infringement of security of the person ']",1
28,Opposition,4586866,"I rise today to honour the memory of Dr. Garson Romalis, who passed away on January 30. Dr. Romalis was a courageous champion of women's reproductive rights and an ardent supporter and provider of safe abortions.
 He received his medical degree from UBC in 1962, prior to the legalization of abortion in Canada. At that time, he treated many women suffering from septic shock in the aftermath of “back-alley abortions”. After Canada's abortion laws changed, Dr. Romalis built his practice on the belief that women have the right to choose when and if they become pregnant.
 Dr. Romalis survived two violent terrorist attacks in Vancouver in 1994 and 2000. Despite these attempts on his life, he remained steadfast in his work and belief in a woman's right to choose. His deep compassion and care have helped countless women and saved lives.
  New Democrats offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we thank them for sharing this great doctor and his life's work with Canadians.","['he received his medical degree from ubc in  prior to the legalization of abortion in canada ', 'new democrats offer our deepest sympathy to his family and we thank them for sharing this great doctor and his lifes work with canadians ', 'at that time he treated many women suffering from septic shock in the aftermath of back alley abortions ']",1
20998,Opposition,4591630,"on International Women's Day, we celebrate the strength and courage of women's rights activists worldwide. Around the world, women and men are standing on the front lines of struggles for equal rights, access to abortion and birth control, LGBTQ rights, the right to be educated, and, in too many places, human rights as well.
 Here at home, indigenous women and their allies are calling for a national inquiry and national action on missing and murdered indigenous women. Every rally, vigil, march, and round dance, held in honour of indigenous women, demonstrates that there is no stopping the tide of voices demanding justice.
 This week, Canadians saw a young, courageous female leader oppose and attack rape culture. Anne-Marie Roy, president of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa, gave a voice to those of us who want to put an end to misogyny on our campuses and in our society.
 As we celebrate International Women's Day, let us celebrate all these fights for equality. We want to express our solidarity with these young people who are fighting for women's rights, and we want them to know that together we will succeed.","['every rally vigil march and round dance held in honour of indigenous women demonstrates that there is no stopping the tide of voices demanding justice ', 'on international womens day we celebrate the strength and courage of womens rights activists worldwide ', 'around the world women and men are standing on the front lines of struggles for equal rights access to abortion and birth control lgbtq rights the right to be educated and in too many places human rights as well ']",2
29,Opposition,4595693,"yesterday, a Conservative member again announced his intention to reopen the abortion debate. Every once in a while, the Conservatives attack women's rights and we in the NDP must stand together to fend off those attacks.
 If this Prime Minister is sincere when he says that the right to abortion is not threatened in Canada, then why do his members keep attacking that right?
 The NDP knows that the vast majority of Canadians believe that women have the right to choose. We are the only party in the House that voted unanimously to uphold that right. We are calling on the Conservative government to move on and do something tangible to ensure women's equality.
 The hon. member for Kitchener Centre may want to live in the past, but we know that today, every woman decides for herself what to do with her body.","['every once in a while the conservatives attack womens rights and we in the ndp must stand together to fend off those attacks ', 'if this prime minister is sincere when he says that the right to abortion is not threatened in canada then why do his members keep attacking that right ', 'member for kitchener centre may want to live in the past but we know that today every woman decides for herself what to do with her body ']",1
21012,Opposition,4602422,"when it comes to development assistance priorities, women's and children's health is certainly high on the list.
 Yes, I said “women's health”, not just “maternal health”. Women are women before they become mothers, and some women are healthier if they do not have children. International aid must focus on the full range of sexual and reproductive rights, not just those that are ideologically acceptable to the Conservatives.
 That means funding access to safe abortion services. Women's and children's health is not limited to just that. Health also means improving access to education for both women and children. However, women's health also includes educating men. Too many women and children who are forced into marriage will become pregnant before they are physically or psychologically ready. Women's and children's health also means improving access to safe drinking water, electricity and decent housing.
 The NDP cares deeply about the health of women and children around the world. That is why women's health should be about more than just maternal health.","['the ndp cares deeply about the health of women and children around the world ', 'when it comes to development assistance priorities womens and childrens health is certainly high on the list ', 'health also means improving access to education for both women and children ']",2
26,Opposition,4616266,"on Friday, I will celebrate the 85th anniversary of the Persons Case with fellow feminists at a breakfast in Halifax for LEAF, the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund. 
 Professor Jula Hughes will speak on the history of legal disputes for abortion access in New Brunswick, which is timely, as its Morgentaler clinic closed this summer. This was the only facility in the province where women could get an abortion free of restrictions, and it served women in New Brunswick and P.E.I.
  Why do women in the Maritimes still have to fight for a right that was granted 26 years ago to all Canadian women? 
 It was 85 years ago that we became persons in the eyes of the law in our country, and 85 years later, women in the Maritimes still face inequalities regarding access to abortion facilities. 
 Today, I stand in solidarity with women in New Brunswick and P.E.l. who say, “my body, my choice”.
  Happy Persons Day, Mr Speaker, the day in 1929 when women were declared persons under the law. It is now 85 years later and we still stand committed to confronting all forms of discrimination to achieve equality for women and girls.","['this was the only facility in the province where women could get an abortion free of restrictions and it served women in new brunswick and p e i why do women in the maritimes still have to fight for a right that was granted  years ago to all canadian women ', 'it was  years ago that we became persons in the eyes of the law in our country and  years later women in the maritimes still face inequalities regarding access to abortion facilities ', 'on friday i will celebrate the  anniversary of the persons case with fellow feminists at a breakfast in halifax for leaf the womens legal education and action fund ']",1
27,Government,4618018,"in light of the 85th anniversary of the Persons Case, I acknowledge the many Canadians who are working to ensure that all human beings are recognized in law.
 Canada truly is among the world's elite when it comes to valuing and protecting human rights, except that we are one of only three countries in the world with no legal protection for children before birth. Sadly, this includes unborn babies who are eliminated and have their precious lives ended just because they are girls.
 Britain knows it is wrong. Its Parliament declared sex-selection abortions illegal by a 181-to-1 vote.
 Canada can fix this too. Let us start by having this Parliament condemn gender-selection abortion. What better day to recognize this than on Persons Day?
 As Dr. Seuss once said, “A person's a person. No matter how small.”","['in light of the  anniversary of the persons case i acknowledge the many canadians who are working to ensure that all human beings are recognized in law ', 'canada truly is among the worlds elite when it comes to valuing and protecting human rights except that we are one of only three countries in the world with no legal protection for children before birth ', 'what better day to recognize this than on persons day ']",0
