access to an abortion should be legal for these reasons 	i do not see how the are analogous so that abortion could be seen as acceptable 	0.9736277891112052
it was not until the  that abortion was illegal in every state and even then it was still permissible in certain circumstances 	however a life is something that can function as a sentient being at this age a foetus is not sentient it is only working off of impulses that because reactions it is not in control of itself or its actions this is like when an animal is killed using an electric bolt the way they are killed now there are still electrical impulses that because actions because of the nerves that still cat after death 	0.9851503754006751

another reason that women should be able to have abortions is in case the mothers are too young and unable to take care their babies 	abortion should be something everyone can agree with because if a woman is raped and does not want a baby she should be able to get an abortion so she will not have to be forced through motherhood 	0.9866792954387263

if a woman gets pregnant and she has a history of heart disease then continuing the pregnancy would put both her and her baby at risk 	i am against abortion because if a man is drunk and he drove and ran a stop light and hit a pregnant woman he would get charged for two murders but if a woman gets pregnant and chooses to not have that child she does not get charged with a murder and it is her fault if she gets pregnant but there is a flaw here is she gets raped then she could have the child but put it in a orphanage rather than not letting the kid have a chance to cure cancer or aids or other diseases like that 	0.9873582754089976

however when a womans health is at risk or they will give birth to a child with defects then abortion would be better for the mother and for the baby 	now let us go through this statement by statement pro has provided no evidence for her views and so we are forced to take her at her word it may be their body but now they are sharing it with a whole other human life form 	0.9878985092870781

finally as those who are having late partial birth abortions are likely to be suicidal or at least will be very determined to get rid of their child they are the most likely to resort to back street methods that because damage to themselves 	thereby it is essentially as dictated by a free tolerant society legal to have abortions by those medical practitioners who agree to perform them 	0.9891690591096933

the first law if a woman is forced to carry to term one fetus then she cannot normally become pregnant with another fetus in the same time period 	 this leads me to my third reason the simple fact of the matter is one cannot prevent a women from getting an abortion for if a women decides for herself that an abortion is the only route to take nothing can stop her from terminating her pregnancy 	0.9937116086566313

the mother can get involved in this type of therapy and be healed 	clarification and development i agree in that the parents do not matter in the sense that they should not get to decide if they want a child but we have to make sure the child life is going to be one where it can prosper and develop because if the parents do not care for their child then it could lead to a life of abuse neglect etc 	0.9796576270669856

if god gave life they believe that the person to whom he gave life has a purpose to serve god in any way that they can and so by ending that life which begins at conception for many removes this persons ability to fulfil gods wishes 	what i meant was that if a child is not going to make it long enough to even experiance any sort of life if they are just going to be so seriously disabled and so seriouisly handicapped that they are completely unaware that there is a life to be lived 	0.9906496409782778
as such abortion is taking away the uniqueness that god bestowed upon us as the human race if we can throw the life of a human as quickly as we can the life of an animal then we have not met this role that god set upon us and have dishonoured his wishes and gifts 	so what I have gleaned from your stance is that you think abortions should be legal as long as the fetus is not caused pain 	0.986761563131927

 before i go on two things need to be cleared up right away  things like will not be brought into this debate 	 is that it would bring peace to the world the  is that it would only be used on children of extreme naughtiness 	0.9827483028027272
we are both anti abortion 	okay to clarify are we talking about the abortion of a chicken or the abortion of a human being 	0.9539927543467391
my argument is that there is no point in terminating the childs life simplify because the mothers life is in danger by carrying the child to full term 	like I have said in my first post first between the nazis attempt to justify their murder by dehumanizing their target and liberals claiming that unborn children are not human which of course they are as one of their main justifications for their malicious deeds 	0.9840697499088494

yes she is right of the amendment and yes we would not be alive to live in the world but still it may be legal but is it the right thing to do 	 is that it would bring peace to the world the  is that it would only be used on children of extreme naughtiness 	0.9861649085579395
my oppenent is also correct when she sais it is not murder because the baby was not born 	con bites the bullet here so there position that abortion even early abortion is murder and thus what should be done to such women is consistent as con says 	0.9819635048385238
we forget so many times that the amendment was written as guide lines and not laws 	rebuttal  kantian ethics it seems odd that one would appeal to john stuart mills ethical system and then right afterwards immanuel kants as the two men definitely disagreed on matters of ethics 	0.9775836072798024
these opinion polls are misleading as they force respondents to choose between an outright ban and no control at all it is impossible for them to register support for partial birth abortion in cases where the mother s physical or psychological health is in danger 	the amount of doctors willing to perform legal abortions is shrinking so much that there has been a  decrease in abortion training in hospitals over the last  years 	0.991728414131967
more importantly this should not be the business of the general public or of legislators 	this argument is used to justify property in the traditional sense of material possessions as well but for the purpose of the debate i will include only the argument for ownership of one s body 	0.982865894581453
nobody who would prefer not to have a partial birth abortion will be made to have one 	well the debate has ended with no effort to argue in favour of abortion by pro 	0.9763208706998662
i do understand what you are saying but the law can enforce this and make it strong against bad fathers 	if a woman is raped and gets pregnant she should not have to bear that child as a constant reminder of that tragedy 	0.9873977459878048
i shall now begin with my points at the root level aborting a baby is taking away a chance at a life a friend to others the potential for growing other people who the baby would have met over the course of its life 	while the bible is not the best source of morality i would agree i was merely stating even back then people wrote about the rights of a minor and the obligations of the parents 	0.9901602279884676
therefore a potential life being thrown away and the positive impacts that that life would have on other people will often outweigh a womans right to choose what to do with her body especially since she will also be impacted by such a baby 	if abortion was illegal the choice would be much simpler and the abortion rate would decrease which is what both the left and the right want to accomplish 	0.9865568669688356
however there are times in which the birth of a child will because suffering rather than happiness and building of people 	in fact before the supreme court case more than  of the illegal abortions were done by medical professionals with high standing in their fields 	0.9780653706406779
the rest of the rebuttals were simply rebutting my points that did not really matter and in fact i will be the first to admit that they were not strong 	once the fetus starts to develop then the signature bulge will start to show but by that time they could be in the second trimester  again women do not always find out they are pregnant immediatley at the first trimester 	0.9897867475258904
the reason that i do not need to prove that abortion is immoral in some circumstances is because we are both trying to argue that at least there are times in which abortion is immoral or more specifically should not be allowed 	to avoid any guessing over the time i will assume that the baby is conscious at a little past  weeks since the parts of the brain for thought and emotion are more complex than the parts for motor control 	0.9909063398400062
however i do not agree with it as even if a zygote is considered human since it has cells that only belong to homo sapiens it is still as unconscious as a skin cell 	counter case iv shifting the goal post this is a small point and thus will not be a long counter case however i feel i should give it it is own place simply to emphasis the point 	0.9867055674940045
rebuttals and pray tell in what way does a zygote have a rational nature without even having a brain 	if a woman is a single woman and the father is not around that child can absolutely have a great life are you that blind 	0.9766382174964415
this does not have to do with it having rights or not or that its life is not worth living it is simply stating that it will not have a life and will instead either be aborted sooner or die in more pain later 	in measuring the two parties rights it becomes quite clear that simply allowing the killing of one party to avoid getting involved in the intimate affairs of the other is not a just solution 	0.9857892686580617
the only time that it lives outside the womb will be in more pain than abortions in early stages because 	it has been noted that my opponent has argued that we do not legalize things based on them being a detriment to society but rather for the basis of immorality which really is like answering a question with a question 	0.9893605181215276
therefore masturbating or having a period is infanticide as well as cutting yourself even though that is not good swabbing your mouth for dna spitting and a plethora of other things because you are detaching cells from your body to die 	the fetus does not have the right of life so we should ban abortion by saying that abortion is murder because it is not according to my arguments and my sourced evidence so as abortion is not murder and harms the mother who has rights abortion should not be illegal or should be legal 	0.989023655589278
the addition of choice to the possibly that a women got enough to eat in the days before ovulation is rational moral and a necessity in a just society 	i do not advocate for people to always get abortions i only advocate for the ability to consent about what they do once they are in this situation 	0.990372735242521
there is no way to know what fetus responses would be similar to asking anyone how they would respond to a hypostatical they could never encounter 	do really i need to mention that you have not used any sources of any kind whatsoever in your past two pathetic excuses for rebuttals 	0.9869486920931385
that is anyone may use it regardless of bastardization of the authors intent 	this varies from state to state and is also a huge reason that late term abortion is banned 	0.9857596211346334
what is more interesting to me about the use of this quote is the necessity of the pro life community to manipulate emotion 	in stead of replying to that you claimed that i did not cite sources something you seem to believe is quite important 	0.9830156341909726
no one makes the claim that the fetus is intentionally attacking the mother s body but the fetus is doing just that 	all the rights a fetus has goes to the mother because in the constitution the  amendment says that something is alive when it is born until then the fetus is part of the womans body 	0.987725058770412

personhood is ambiguousunless absolutely necessary within the context of the debate i will not argue over personhood only realize that each side has somewhat conflicting definitions 	often the offer of such quick and easy solutions as abortion only serve those who are uncomfortable or unwilling to deal with the special problems and needs that such complications as pregnancy might present 	0.9847470118390553

the two you have chosen are of interest to me and are common to the pro life debater 	if you begin to make it more difficult or impossible for unwed teenage mothers and other women who are not ready to become a mother to receive an abortion the government will be forced to put all of these women on welfare food stamps etc 	0.9870189719014894
they may have spared pro some trouble but not only do they seem better said now as part of my rebuttal they also may serve pro better now that he or she has had the opportunity to make the argument he wanted 	there are many mothers that want a baby but can not have one and there are mothers who are whores and can have them but are to lazy to fill out the paper work to give it up for adoption so they just kill the baby 	0.9859949461297521
the simple answer for me is it is meaningless 	also a sperm does not simply die when it fertilizes an egg it simply merges with it and combines dna 	0.9651268711943993
moral or immoral from one point of view or another asking the government is siding with one over the other pro life must by necessity negate the moral decisions of pro choice 	moreover a girl in dire economic conditions might not even afford to be pregnant so it does not make sense for her to give birth and then give the child away because she is too poor to support it 	0.9890864939852833
the question then becomes does the government have interest for the sake of society to intervene and control a woman s body without her consent based on one set of morals while excluding another s enforcing by law the sense of moral superiority of one group 	also you have left one of my arguments uncontested if fetal rights were enshrined in law womens bodies rights and health would be subordinated to the protection of embryos 	0.9881532213446514

 greatest happiness the term john stuart mill choose as the grandfather of the concepts of just society has significant interest in this debate 	lastly if con wants to just reject such bodily rights as mere assertions and not objectively established then the same can be done to their right to life how ever that right is defined assertions and arguments that operate on such an assumption 	0.9883612125481046

not allowing women to consult with professionals when seeking abortion services only poses more of a threat to womens reproductive health 	also considering recent advancements in technology it will not be too long before organ donation will be less necessary than before I am not going to provide a source otherwise this crosses the line from rebuttal to new point 	0.9841608143449442
unless you can prove that regulating abortions will result in the immediate halt of all abortions there is no reason that the government should intervene on such decisions 	in any case the cost of these new methods is so high and likely to remain so that the proposition argument is irrelevant the use of ultrasound scanning leading to selective abortion is so much cheaper that this great evil will not be reduced 	0.9896811284059173
while these laws in some way affect a large part of society only a woman has to deal with the emotional consequences of terminating a pregnancy 	an abortion can not be painful to a child as at the stage of development they can legally be aborted at they are a very simple organism that cannot feel pain or trauma it is incapable of knowledge around subjects such as this for instance can you find anyone that can tell you what their life was like before they were born then i would except the possibility of gathering knowledge but no one has ever made this feat 	0.9837540115721702
denying women access to medical services that enable them to regulate their fertility or terminate a dangerous pregnancy amounts to a refusal to provide health care to women 	moral patients like animals fetuses infants the handicapped ecosystems or even future generations may not be able to act morally themselves but their nature may still require us to act morally towards them even if no contractual arrangement is arranged between either party 	0.9907778396615498

the small number of abortions that take place is outweighed by the fact that these abortions will take place post legislation which guarantees the terminated pregnancy but also threatens the mothers life 	this belief is based on the idea that there is a set of natural processes which eventually leads to a human being outside of the womb let us for the sake of argument tentatively agree that life at least in potential occurs at conception 	0.9878243839782846
to refuse on principle to permit a woman to consider her life or welfare when it seems threatened by pregnancy is to say that only men are the recipients of political freedom and responsibility 	not only is it in bad taste to characterize your opponent either specifically or in the general sense of people who disagree with you it is not a valid means of argument 	0.9881861452583414

he does however assume the right to force a woman to a life of maternal incubation and financial and physical servitude and then absolve himself of all further responsibilities 	the study actually stated that women who abort actually suffer more than those who do not because it is likely that the victim already harbors feelings of guilt as a result of the assault medico social pressures which encourage and result in abortion could compound the woman s feelings of guilt and self blame perhaps as a result of their own biases and an unwillingness to deal with the more emotionally difficult complications of a pregnant rape victim many physicians suggest abortion in this case as one would prescribe aspirin for tension headache while on the surface this suggestion may appear acceptable and even humane to many the victim is dealt another disservice 	0.9890362911383882

to humour you however i respond with this those death numbers are justifiable in that the death is caused by self defence 	therefore if the mother is conscious during the first  weeks she should be well aware of her condition and should have by this point accepted her destiny to become a mother otherwise she would have abort the child in the earlier stages 	0.9862176054787453

this strongly implies utility per person i e how happy each person is in society however he affirms his arguments for abortion in a sense that he is maximising total or net utility 	this is important because i want to have my viewpoint challenged the reason i think rich or middle class women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish is self explanatory 	0.985878977555684
counter rebuttalsliberty of foetusall of pro s defences to my arguments assumes that the foetus is equivalent to an adult human in its rights and liberties to which i have already provided reason why this is not the case 	 a more clear example is within the us constitution with the  amendment which states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the united states is also part of a larger coalition of countries known as the united nations therefore abides or at least should abide by protecting human rights as they define it 	0.9919269292930039
these are two completely different measures and hence he cannot hold on to his argument that we lose a total of  years of happiness if we abort with his current arguments for his value of utilitarianism as it is a fallacy as it stands 	to think that the lives of infants are of special value because infants are small and cute is on a par with thinking that a baby seal with its soft white fur coat and large round eyes deserves greater protection than a gorilla who lacks these qualities 	0.9927802062559914
memoryi do not intend to demonstrate the connection of the permissibility of killing i intended to demonstrate that the lack of memories means that the foetus is for the purposes of liberty dead as a person 	that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness 	0.9896032589897197
as a result political devices such as human rights of which i affirmed liberty is one of the most fundamental are required which does not entail maximising happiness on a case by case basis 	i still maintain that such an abortion being murder is more plausibly false and contra con if anyone is a victim here its women who have being told and had to live under laws that presuppose this false premise 	0.985358186924378
moreover pro does not object to any of my facts regarding what foetus is a cluster of cells with no ability to feel pain or experience anything especially in the first few weeks 	even worse is when abortion is railed against by those whom proclaim they are fighting for a possible life they themselves are not willing to take care of and will soon as possible turn a blind eye to the forthcoming real suffering of lives effected by 	0.9897115190460296
furthermore my argument is not about being aware of one s value of identity only that we do as a society value our identity hence why we prohibit actions that affect it such as murder thus we cannot value the foetus in the same way since it clearly does not have an identity in that regards 	buy observing the traditions of society we know that society universal treats the death of a fertilized egg in a way much inferior to the death of a human being 	0.9910713895915959
it is only by subjective assessment that one party is deemed to be happier than another thus it is useless as a device for separating out the preference of one act over another especially if it strips away the context 	therefore abortion is not justified in cases of rape because there is no reason to suppose that it actually helps the rape victim and it even suggests that it negatively affects them 	0.9943752288001886
if a person was both comatose and amnesic a far superior analogy then pro would have to provide very good reason why the government should not kill that person 	when a woman gets raped the government should pay for her to have an abortion because she should not have to pay for someone doing something terrible 	0.9858672698565805

for example a foetus s cell types is virtually undifferentiated until the forth week where the first cells begin to form what is necessary for the brain with the last component the corpus callosum not emerging until the  day 	yes i see your point on the matter however the problem is the fact that if the mother gets pregnant and the risk of dying in child birth exists than why should the mother put her life on the line for a child she does not even want at times which is feeding off of her body and may possibly have to grow up with conditions that would hinder it from ever entering society yes i perfectly open to admitting that abortion is murder because it has been observed that the fetus is in essence alive due to the fact that at proper conception nuclear fusion occurs and makes new cells however those cells are not necessarily capable of coherent thought thus the only thing that you are killing are a group of cells that currently are residing inside the mothers womb those cells which in essence are the same kind of cells we kill on a daily basis when we wash the floor or clean the dishes or clean the bathroom or anything we are trying to get clean almost always involves the murder of cells and or bacteria we just feel different about the cells residing inside the mothers womb because they will grow into a human in later development which is fair understandable but the child those collection of cells will grow into could develop horrible mutations in its genes or will have copying errors in its dna due to the lack of genetic diversity in the case of incest 	0.9903074786896264
while it may be considered immoral to withhold such donations or treatments this is the price we pay to have adequate liberty for a functional and stable society 	i did not mean that individual cases have separate consequences requirements only that the woman involved should be able at any time in the pregnancy to get an abortion with the advisory of a medical professional i only include them here for circumstances where the womans health might be at risk with it still being a morally just thing to do 	0.9910453193151543

by restricting abortion we essentially drive the practice underground with illegal abortions becoming prominent these abortions lack the safety controls and health considerations that legal abortions have with brutal methodologies such as beating a woman s abdomen piercing the amniotic sac with a sharp object e g coathangers and the use of makeshift poisons 	a batch of such reports might read something like this name dick tater age  analysis a dangerous manically depressive loner who exhibits an unhealthy obsession with guns and who is liable to walk into school armed with a high powered firearm and indiscriminately shoot students and teachers before turning the gun on himself but who is not intelligent enough to pose any serious threat to national security 	0.9900657598626822
 i can accept pro s general axiom that a government must enable a stable society in order to exist thus if a government is to exist then it must provide this society in one manner or another and human liberty is demonstrably an excellent manner of accomplishing such 	first of all when con says but provides no source defining how he was led to this conclusion nor does he back up this statement therefore it is a baseless opinion statement irrelevant as no evidence has been presented by my opposition that i can really accept as valid as there is not much i can rebutt from that statement which proves that its not really a valid argument 	0.9897290782168403
memory valueschildhood amnesia is well established in the literature and it is well known that children do not retain knowledge or memories before  years of age well after the age at which abortion is possible this ties in with my identity argument in that the only thing which allows one to identify as themselves is their memory of their previous state 	if we are still banning abortion then it is a harm to the mothers liberty which contradicts this framework making it illegal as liberty is the  amendment and the government needs to give the life liberty and security of ones self and does not do its job hence it is illegal 	0.9916305625306688
thus under no circumstances does a human foetus qualify as a being to which we need to consider the liberty of thus a minimal government lacks sufficient reason for prohibiting abortion for these reasons 	i hope you are not attempting to mask suffering in some ambiguous notions so to equate the suffering of a fetus or unborn child to a born child whose suffering will be greater because their capacity to realizing this burden on themselves and those in his her life 	0.991887036746381

 rule utilitarianism upholds them because it recognises that a society will generally be happier if we establish certain rights if rule utilitarian compromises on happiness because establishing rights increases it then none of pro s arguments for maximising utility in the case of abortion are sound 	while in as much as  countries abortion is legalized remaining countries have partial restrictions or complete ban on abortion unless life of the mother is at stake 	0.9875093096261361

because pro must first assume the conclusion before justifying the premise his position explicitly begs the question and hence is unsound since stability of government is exactly what we are trying to affirm here it is the conclusion we are trying to achieve 	 consciousness  reasoning  self motivated activity  the capacity to communicate  the presence of self concepts and self awareness if we use pros criteria to terminate living human organisms there will be no restrictions in abortions there will be living human organisms outside the womb that can be terminated 	0.9883316446963795
according to pro s logic then it would be acceptable to just snip the umbilical cord or wherever else is necessary perhaps even remove the entire uterus itself which is clearly part of the mother and wait for the foetus to die on its own accord such as is performed in some hyserosomy abortions 	specifically premise  an unborn child morally deserves the chance to livepremise  a rape victim morally deserves to be freed of being retraumatized by the rapepremise  being forced to carry the rapists child results in daily retraumatizing the rape victimthereforepremise  a rape victim morally deserves not to be forced to carry the rapists childpremise  the only way for the unborn child to live is for the mother to carry the child to termpremise  for a rape victim to not be forced to carry the rapists child she must have the choice to abort the childtherefore premise  premise  and premise  are incompatible and it is impossible for both moral requirements to be metpremise  in the case of conflicting moral requirements the moral choice is the one which results in the least human sufferingpremise  aborting a child before it has developed a nervous system a brain any consciousness or means of experiencing existence results in no human sufferingpremise  forcing a mother to carry the rapists child can result in daily and extreme human sufferingtherefore from    and  conclusion the moral choice is to allow the mother the option of aborting the child while still undeveloped which would result in zero suffering by the child and would prevent great suffering by the motherthis argument is valid as the conclusion logically follows from the premises 	0.9904958443935422
because pro s entire defence of value is predicated on a strawman then his objections to liberty and rights are also a strawman 	a side note abortion is never necessary to save a womans life and pro choice always use the argument about rape and incest 	0.9921404189211815
frameworklibertyi did not advocate for the harm principle nor did i even cite it hence large swaths of pro s rebuttal to my positive case is a blatant strawman 	to start my argument i would like to invoke what i will argue are important factors in deciding whether abortion is acceptable on the terms i agreed to above 	0.9890829820701774
 the only reason why indirect death is preferable is due to diffusion of responsibility perhaps the patient could have obtained an organ donation elsewhere etc 	i might argue that this concession already cedes the entire debate if any instance of abortion can be considered appropriate then abortion should be considered legal 	0.9874761037272275
 in short they take responsibility for their own welfare so it is no longer the governments concern if we are assuming utility as a value then pro cannot make this defence without undermining his own case 	i am not denying fetuses are living creations however the issue is abortion and how it should be womans right to terminate a pregnancy 	0.9921323869374423
thus while  of pro s dichotomy is correct liberty ought only be impeded if it impedes on the liberty of others these parameters do not apply in the same way to bodily autonomy 	however your question is a good one and I would like to at least explain my thought process for the answers to the questions in my profile which is i assume where you found that i with abortion yet with the death penalty for me factors for which i base my decisions surrounding my choice not to support the death penalty are very different from those on which i base my decision to be pro choice 	0.9851389609039201
pro is running with the assumption that laws are there to maximise happiness but does not make any attempt to prove this or rebut my liberty value which contradicts it 	i am open to the idea that maybe abortion should be more restricted in the later stages but being open to that possibility is not the same as just assuming it i would need to see arguments in support such a thing that can withstand critical scrutiny 	0.9887066870221561
also this assumes an extremely wealthy environment which is not the case for an extremely large minority of the world see the following chart pro also drops that it causes other complications including reduced quality of life mental health issues etc 	yes i see your point on the matter however the problem is the fact that if the mother gets pregnant and the risk of dying in child birth exists than why should the mother put her life on the line for a child she does not even want at times which is feeding off of her body and may possibly have to grow up with conditions that would hinder it from ever entering society yes i perfectly open to admitting that abortion is murder because it has been observed that the fetus is in essence alive due to the fact that at proper conception nuclear fusion occurs and makes new cells however those cells are not necessarily capable of coherent thought thus the only thing that you are killing are a group of cells that currently are residing inside the mothers womb those cells which in essence are the same kind of cells we kill on a daily basis when we wash the floor or clean the dishes or clean the bathroom or anything we are trying to get clean almost always involves the murder of cells and or bacteria we just feel different about the cells residing inside the mothers womb because they will grow into a human in later development which is fair understandable but the child those collection of cells will grow into could develop horrible mutations in its genes or will have copying errors in its dna due to the lack of genetic diversity in the case of incest 	0.9895904880579882
just where is pro s argument that the right and freedom to abortion does not increase total happiness via 	what i had stated in my opinion on abortion is not a guideline just an assertion that there are cases where it is better for one decision to be made for another person rather than having them make it themselves 	0.9894046896988404
absolute selective bodily autonomywe have already established that bodily autonomy ought to be upheld for a stable society even if it restricts the rights or harms other people such as is the case with the organ transplant scenario 	an issue that both those who are pro life and pro choice will refute as neither side would agree that the father should ultimately have any say in the decision to abort for completely opposite reasons 	0.9912353208505987
also pro is conflating a consequence of a stable society increased utility from the norm with the requisite of a stable society 	however on the face of it elective abortion is not morally permissible and only in an exceptional circumstance such as the one noted above is it permissible if the mothers life is at risk 	0.9850596883626879
also pro s defence here presupposes that the foetus is a being who has rights to begin with question begging organ donationgiven that pro accepts the premise that someone ought to have the right and liberty to withhold use of their organs even if it maximises utility then pro s defence here is already dubious 	he has ignored my entire argument which has been that the dog cannot represent the fetus because a dog is a living entity outside of myself whereas a fetus is not a living entity outside of the mother 	0.989593679725804
virtually all of pro s case can be dismissed on these grounds 	this is because there is currently less of a stigma towards single parenthood so less social pressure to abort and medical hygiene has improved on a general scale  	0.980350640380803

illegal legal abortionscon states that i have not provided a shred of evidence to support my claim that prohibiting abortion would reduce the frequency of abortion 	as to your argument of population control though i am generally of the opinion that such detached weighing of outcomes is not a practice largely because i think it obvious that morality comes from a combination of natural feeling and reason and though perhaps such weighing is logical and so in some sense i find it that i feel it is abhorrent i must argue that even if one feels morally compelled to weigh matters of importance as such that the abolition of late term abortion does not because one to completely abandon the idea of population control as types of effective contraceptives are many and early abortions quite easy to carry out 	0.9882087276550969
the former has absurd conclusions because it includes potential beings as well of which there are near infinite amount of which would render it impossible to pragmatically assess the utility of a certain law 	the study actually stated that women who abort actually suffer more than those who do not because it is likely that the victim already harbors feelings of guilt as a result of the assault medico social pressures which encourage and result in abortion could compound the woman s feelings of guilt and self blame perhaps as a result of their own biases and an unwillingness to deal with the more emotionally difficult complications of a pregnant rape victim many physicians suggest abortion in this case as one would prescribe aspirin for tension headache while on the surface this suggestion may appear acceptable and even humane to many the victim is dealt another disservice 	0.9932371860211902
in individual cases enforcing equality can lead to less happiness but for a whole society the overall happiness is maximised by having equality 	sexually abused child again this is where adoption comes in 	0.9840355734765928
so utility does not necessarily have to know what happiness is defined as it just needs to allow the maximising of happiness indirectly by allowing the pursuit of happiness 	this definition can only apply because justice is based on human worth itself and what is due to a specific person 	0.9825040168123665
if legally enforced human rights caused a net decrease in happiness for the people involved then there would be no reason to have them 	this controversy will remain for centuries however the fact that a potential life has ended before given a chance remains evidence enough for most people to understand why a person should never have a choice of whether a baby lives or dies 	0.9903448864922083
but we must consider the future of the person in a utilitarian calculation since the past is irrelevant and the present infintesimal 	an abortion after that point only happens under special circumstances such as when it is killing the mother or has serious defects that will kill it and the fetus is euthanized before a  trimester abortion meaning it feels none of the abortion 	0.9848520892465241

generally there are things that we almost universally find to be conducive to happiness such as life liberty love and knowledge so even if we cannot exactly quantify happiness we can still recognise an increase of happiness as well as compare peoples happiness 	as such the focus of the debate per pros insistence will be primarily on its general use and not on extreme cases like anencephaly and so on 	0.9867430554345337

 whilst they rights do not entail maximising happiness on a case by case basis they entail maximising happiness if a rule is instigated that enforces them 	i can understand if con thinks I am less persuative but my impression is that he is acting as if there is something more quantitative that I am missing 	0.9832779253778179
this is because human rights only exist because their existence causes an increase in net happiness even if this does not happen in each individual situation where rights conflict with utility 	this displays that pros side subjectively believes there exist scenarios in which the ending of life by human intervention is sometimes a justifiable action 	0.9840167586543803
the latter only considers actual beings which is much more pragmatic because there is the ability to know roughly the resultant utility of our actions by seeing how it will affect those involved 	he says that when a woman is forced to give birth the she loses utility but does not actually touch on how the mother losing utility because of her actions means she can abort to alleviate herself of her responsibility 	0.9889909093743301

i am definitely not asserting that the government ought to maximise happiness on a case by case basis since this goes beyond the governments role as a legislative authority 	my opponents argument is that it is justifiable to use force as this has not been elaborated on I am going to assume it is against the mother or maybe even the doctor because killing a fetus is in the eyes of my opponent is essentially killing an innocent person the prevention of which is deemed morally necessary 	0.9883527870973875
if it is known that a brain dead patient will recover and live a long life thereafter then the government certainly would not be justified in killing them 	it would be like declaring the benchmark of life for the butterfly organism is the presence of wings and antennae and then after examining the caterpillar pronouncing that because it has neither wings nor antennae it is neither living nor a butterfly despite the fact that it is a living organism with the genome of the butterfly and if it is not killed before it completes its metamorphosis will become nothing other than a butterfly 	0.985962269536618

 the government ought to base laws upon the principle of  the banning of abortion would be because more happiness to the parties involved than the permitting of it 	although i do not have time to supply evidence to this claim i can supply it next time as i know many examples of this happening but this consent argument is very strong the only problem is people on both parties often consent but then regret their decision later 	0.9882572328559189
  it goes without saying that the governments purpose is to create a stable society otherwise it has no substantial role 	i want to point out that this debate specifically is asking whether or not teenage girls who are the victims of rape should have access to abortions 	0.986132054105658
considering that the government ought to create a stable society it follows that the principles that are most conducive to a stable society are the principles upon which the government ought to create its laws 	the supreme court recognizes that the state constitution of alabama which states that the people of this state have the right to go through the abortion process as long as it is not after  weeks of the pregnancy at the point when the government is seeking laws to protect this so called baby they are valuing and respecting the life of the baby 	0.9895277514489791
  in other words when the government makes laws it ought to maximise the happiness and minimise the unhappiness of all beings that are affected by the law 	why would anyone create anything better than something else yet have that same thing bound by its own will which makes it the same as the things it was supposed to be different from 	0.9889831477750491

my second argument is that if the mother truly does not want the baby she does not have to kill it but should rather put it up for adoption 	i know it sounds harsh it sounds harsh to me too but the cold hard truth is that it would be better for the entire world and the people that reside upon it for that person to not be born 	0.9893364906279539

on with the debate right so a fetus at the moment of conception we agree is probably not worthy of having the same value as an adult human 	however those that do not are felt to be abhorrent and immoral by people who have a full knowledge of the facts that is including knowledge that there is no reason to think of jews gays etc as sub human being that as i stated in arg 	0.9926249081331948
it seems that the best place to draw the line is when the fetus goes from not having the same value as an adult human to having it 	there is not a consensus to when a human life begins that argument is flimsy due to the fact that sperm and egg are living and it could be argued that they too have human life 	0.9899707359565415

though late term abortions are certainly an inhumane solution to the problem many women face in unwanted children i would disagree that it is comparable to killing a child who has taken its first breath 	i did not mean that individual cases have separate consequences requirements only that the woman involved should be able at any time in the pregnancy to get an abortion with the advisory of a medical professional i only include them here for circumstances where the womans health might be at risk with it still being a morally just thing to do 	0.9914308469961918

abortion is not murder because the fetus has not developed enough to be considered a person yet and is virtually only a bunch of cells also it should be the mothers choice on whether they abort the baby or not 	it all boils down to personal choice whether an abortion should even be committed but at the end of the day money is being used in various branches of the economy that not everyone agrees to such as the death penalty housing inmates nuclear bombs and military service 	0.9883986258948207

another circumstance would be rape or incest that a woman who is raped and impregnated would be forced to keep the child of the rapist is incredibly immoral and reveals the gender issue behind abortion 	for example if a rare genetic disorder was discovered that would create a baby born with a severe physical or mental impairment that was not correctable and would lead to a short depressing lifespan or if a woman life would be seriously endangered by continuing with the pregnancy 	0.9917433797334017

in severe cases of this it is likely that the baby dies almost immediately after being born and cannot be ensured any quality of life or conscious experience 	the reason unalienable rights exist is because we need an objective foundation from which all rights may transcend in order to make the most efficient and morally sound society as possible 	0.9897460041575986

if there is no hope of that person being restored to consciousness we will likely take them off life support as is many times the case 	my argument is and has been this if we as a society are to weigh the value of life to all persons in making decisions then we must also consider the value of the life of the possible person inside the mothers womb 	0.9898865069130327

therefore as pretty much all human beings have a future life with the capacity to be desirable and that killing is the removal of this future life then we can conclude that the killing of human beings is wrong 	however the right to self ownership cannot justify killing a fetus which will become a human being and have a future and life like us 	0.9897200112513799
note that i will make the following concession that i accept that abortion should be legal in cases where it is necessary to save the mother from death or severe physical injury 	yes i see your point on the matter however the problem is the fact that if the mother gets pregnant and the risk of dying in child birth exists than why should the mother put her life on the line for a child she does not even want at times which is feeding off of her body and may possibly have to grow up with conditions that would hinder it from ever entering society yes i perfectly open to admitting that abortion is murder because it has been observed that the fetus is in essence alive due to the fact that at proper conception nuclear fusion occurs and makes new cells however those cells are not necessarily capable of coherent thought thus the only thing that you are killing are a group of cells that currently are residing inside the mothers womb those cells which in essence are the same kind of cells we kill on a daily basis when we wash the floor or clean the dishes or clean the bathroom or anything we are trying to get clean almost always involves the murder of cells and or bacteria we just feel different about the cells residing inside the mothers womb because they will grow into a human in later development which is fair understandable but the child those collection of cells will grow into could develop horrible mutations in its genes or will have copying errors in its dna due to the lack of genetic diversity in the case of incest 	0.9929269245311398
furthermore if one was to be diagnosed with cancer and given  weeks to live probably the main reason why the patient would feel saddened would be that they feel disappointment with the prospect of missing out on a future life 	however for the sake of an interesting debate i will concede this contention and agree with my opponent that an embryo as well as a fetus is a complete full fledged person with  human rights 	0.9933460685118389

this is demonstrated by how people often mourn the dead by saying he had so much to live for 	let us say that you disagree with  because you do not think deciding a moral system should be in the hands of humans themselves but it should be derived from a higher power beyond our control 	0.989003670009515

i doubt you would agree with that statement so if the same can not apply for adult human beings who do not have the ability to feel pain how could it apply for a developing human being who can not feel pain either 	my opponent would have us believe that n the face of it it is morally wrong to kill another human being 	0.9903311147111538
with this significant scientific disagreement i believe that until more substantial proof supports the  week limit we should to be safe make the limit at  weeks 	hence the killing of a foetus is not permissible whereas the killing of a sperm is permissible as the latter is not being denied the opportunity to live a future human life 	0.9818194852755497

final comments at the end of the day i admit that my opponents arguments from an empirical perspective do show that in this physical world with our laws culture society and police force that our quasi legalized abortion certain kinds are not legal depending on country does not reduce crime or at least is unknowable 	according to the marriam websters dictionary a human is a bipedal primate mammal homo sapiens man broadly hominid hu man like listen to the pronunciation of humanlike m n l k adjective and it defines a fetus as an unborn or unhatched vertebrate especially after attaining the basic structural plan of its kind specifically a developing human from usually two months after conception to birth and the definition of develop we can look at  a to go through a process of natural growth differentiation or evolution by successive changes b to acquire secondary sex characteristics now to argue my opponents case 	0.9937925646086344

if we follow your premise that all humans also have a right to use their own bodies how they please why does not this apply to the unborn 	 my opponent also states pro life if you are not aware means that you believe the government should not only have a say in a womens decision of what is right to do with her body and her child but that it should have the only say 	0.9863613033078044

my original point was alluding to the fact that a mother should have the right to choose what she does with her own body at least until the fetus has developed the capacity to feel pain or know it exists 	if the parents want to have the child and give it away for adoption that is fine however if the mother thinks she will find it emotionally stressful and would rather an abortion she should be free to do just that 	0.9885857700222868

the only incidences in which the action of abortion prevents more harm than it causes is when the child has a genetic disorder that would be debilitating or incapacitating and prevent it from living a normal life 	however if their decisions actions not respecting the daughters own decision will result in harm to their daughter ie not wanting to abort a pregnancy that may kill their daughter then the physician can take legal action against the parents and child services agencies and the court will also get involved in the decision making 	0.9915340189463782
for this point to be relevant my opponent would need to demonstrate that this right is grounded in morality 	if pro is trying to argue that the definition does not or should not mean what people think it does then his argument would still be irrelevant 	0.9881950674316611
this defeats the and arguments as in each case an entire life is worth more than part of one in addition to the other imbalances mentioned above 	what i had stated in my opinion on abortion is not a guideline just an assertion that there are cases where it is better for one decision to be made for another person rather than having them make it themselves 	0.9931299564193151

no one is saying that the mothers are forced to choose abortion but if either one of them are in danger it is the better choice 	even then if we are going to do a study on this from all abortion cases the rape ones might be the ones in first place compared to the others so it is worth looking centering around for this debate 	0.9865869189379404

 in the case of rape this is a tiny bit different but less than  of abortions are due to rape also just because the babies dad is a rapist does not mean the baby should not have a chance at life 	she has cancer and is pregnant and needs the chemo to save her life but a bi product of that is that the baby will be aborted 	0.9872872653520214
technically the baby is a part of the mother but the baby itself is a unique human being all it is own why should the mother be able to kill her baby since it has no way to defend his or herself 	it has nothing to do with abortion unless she is already pregnant then yea she should be forced to produce a life giving birth is a miracle just because she may not want the baby does not mean she can not give the baby up for adoption because unlike her there are people in the world who may or trying to have a child but can not she is really lucky in many cases she should not kill the baby 	0.985590178699233

also your concluding argument has nothing to do the debate which was thus commenting on it would be pointless for both sides 	going into the discussion of womens rights as a female i do understand what women had to go through to obtain and hold these rights that we have today however many women act impulsively when deciding on abortion and this is not a subject that should be taken lightly 	0.9846174458691336
the women has an option to put the child up for adoption or foster care to avoid that problem or the women is strong enough to get over such a gruesome attack 	i do not deny that home abortions might be a current problem although i would ask pro how common they are but i propose a different solution do not get pregnant or go through with the pregnancy 	0.9874426404301453

my argument is that the mother should have the say in whether they get an abortion or not 	it is important to note that the true question here is are the unborn human because if they are not then they do not get human rights and abortion should be legal but if they are human then they deserve the human right to life like every other human 	0.9844444642223432
the problem here is the fact that you are missing the point of my previous argument although you might ask for help in raising that child the mother and child may have already died in childbirth due to the fact that the mother was so young also because she is young there is an increased chance of birth defects the child may have to bear for the rest of their lives why should a child have to bear that kind of suffering for something that is not their fault and may not even be the mothers fault 	the point is that children should have a family who wants them and cares for them at the beginning and if the woman was forced to be a mother it is most likely that they do not desire the baby much less care for it 	0.9926982963370296
 the circumstances i listed above are things that this child might encounter and have problems with so why should a child have to live with themselves in the state they are in simply because their mother did not have a chance to end their pain and suffering before it even began 	however as i have said before there is a line that needs to be drawn when the mother just finds it inconvenient to have the child or dislikes the gender race or the fact that a child had a disability etc 	0.9920344936737344
and sometimes their are women who do not have adoption agencies in their area or their families do not care about their situations so once again i submit to you that the points you make are far to generalised and do not encompass the entire spectrum of this issue and the many different circumstances that come with it 	sustainability has been the number one reason for most of human existence though i might add for most of that time the process of abortion was not understood and instead infanticide was the typical course taken 	0.9925620882824917

i do not really understand your sentence about someone having to be born to die 	i do believe that a minor should need consent for an abortion 	0.9814818112251891
whatever it is it is up to the mother if she wants to do it and no one can say otherwise 	the simplest way to answer this entire question is to show the fact that the murder of a pregnant woman is two counts of homicide 	0.9870190275989904
murder killing something living pro conceded that it is not living therefore it is not murder 	in other words since the sperm all depend on fertilizing the egg in order to become sentient it is not immoral for them to fertilize it 	0.9725780460016907

the reason why i believe this is because it will develop into a human 	he she is still a living being and has potential to life and denying them the privilige of life would be cruel just because they have an extra chromosome 	0.9836328987686134
this is passing into the realm of morality slightly with the question con has asked me and as a person who subscribes to secular humanism for morality i will try my best to answer cons question 	i accept pros formulation of my argument as reasonably fair though he seems to have misunderstood it at points as i will discuss 	0.9869358661436135
it is only going to add suffering due to the financial burden on their part as well as on the child for it may be neglected due to its parents having to work day and night to support it 	but if you get pregnant then it should be seen as a responsibility to at least deliver the child and set it up for adoption if you do not want it 	0.9904911559645161
so aborting the baby is the equivalent of that as it relieves the mother and child of future stress and suffering and in both cases the baby would not be born anyway 	but if you thought that the baby s right to be fed is incoherent because it denied her parent s so called right to self ownership and therefore it was moral for them to care for a virtual baby instead of their own child then i can confidently say that your moral sense is simply broken 	0.987937720723035
having the baby born would be punishing both the mother and the child as the mother has to spend time and money to raise the child while the child may not have a good childhood due to the mothers inability to take care of it sufficiently or as a single parent 	the point is that children should have a family who wants them and cares for them at the beginning and if the woman was forced to be a mother it is most likely that they do not desire the baby much less care for it 	0.991243205452259
the main answer i would provide is that it causes pain and suffering to the babys family 	i have shown this in a majority of waysmy adversary is claiming that by having an abortion in every possible situation you are essentially committing murder but she has failed to distinguish that a fetus is a human life and not just life or the potential of human life 	0.98837823560486

i will admit in my previous response i deconstructed this poorly considering i as under heavy time constraints but now i can talk about this in more detail 	given that pro s only surviving justification is one of desiring to live or objecting to death and given that a teen in such a state would momentarily desire to die it seems that murder in this instance would be permissible on pro s account 	0.9908073775992333
next you talk about how i fair to support my claim to why i believe the childs life should not end because of the parents 	if you believe a mother should be forced to die so that she may give birth simply because the child would live longer than she would congratulations to my opponent  	0.9888434049689465

so basically what i am trying to argue is that all human life is equal therefore a human should not have the choice too murder another human for their personal benefit 	you are saying that rather than teach the rapist not to rape you would rather force the woman through childbirth painful labour and if your premature arguments are worth anything extremely painful labour as the undeveloped children that do have sex will have to give birth using their own bodies of which all would not be ready for such a streinuous effort as childbirth and force them to then hand the baby over to the government and move on 	0.9875388272242639

you argue that this is because this debate is not completely based on morality where i would argue that it is 	i think this exhibits some flaws in logic because the next logical step that my adversary would take is that killing this person or baby after the time it was conceived would be murder 	0.9867233609524326
i will also be examining ideas relating to morality such as the individuality of the fetus putting your own rights above others and the abortion industry as a whole which is completely immoral 	it fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life metabolism growth reaction to stimuli and reproduction finally is the human zygote merely a new kind of cell or is it a human organism that is a human being 	0.9898942827651818
i am very interested in your second argument and thus will present the argument this is meant to rebut first 	the constitution has been amended  times since its inception and interpreted innumerable times by the supreme court meaning the law as written is not necessarily the way the law has ought to remain 	0.9796097398290821
i will be examining alternatives such as adoption as well as looking into the psychological stress and harm abortion can because the recipient the mother as well as the doctor 	the study actually stated that women who abort actually suffer more than those who do not because it is likely that the victim already harbors feelings of guilt as a result of the assault medico social pressures which encourage and result in abortion could compound the woman s feelings of guilt and self blame perhaps as a result of their own biases and an unwillingness to deal with the more emotionally difficult complications of a pregnant rape victim many physicians suggest abortion in this case as one would prescribe aspirin for tension headache while on the surface this suggestion may appear acceptable and even humane to many the victim is dealt another disservice 	0.9904694058552614
true older parents do not live as long but there is always a better choice than death and as for physical effects if you are not willing to take some pain or die for your own blood that is pathetic 	to transform a fetus into a baby and then send it out into a world where the parents can have no assurance that it will be well loved and cared for is for pro choice people the height of moral irresponsibility 	0.9950835634929606
now as for somebody not knowing someone you do not need to know someone go on line to find a group that will help you pick a family for your child before it is born and also spanking them or giving them shots or circumcised that helps them later in life it dose not end there life and people that have a tuff life enjoy life more when something good happens 	for someone to hold a person body hostage to drain them of resource and comfort against their will even someone who is life may depend on that body is not right 	0.9890601103867808
still i do not think kids should be having sex they have meds for stress and depression plus sex is not made for enjoyment or to help with problems its for reproduction between a man and a women for a child to be made and for nothing else 	so a sperm being killed is not condidered wrong as the life does not have any worth 	0.9904256235119578
now about you saying if a condom breaks there can be consequences like pregnancy and stds and how i would not wish for someone to have to keep an std if they did not have to your right i would not wish that on someone yet a child is not a disease it lives it breathes it has a heartbeat and if the parents are too poor or young or old or sick there are answers for all of those too young they should not be sleeping together too sick they should not be pregnant be because they should not be having sex and too poor or old adoption 	abortion is morally wrong since it ends something that at best could have been a source of joy for those around it and possibily many other people and at worst a nuisance to society before it could even begin 	0.9907498429664413
plus with abortion being only wrong if you are not blessed enough to be set up in a good environment to raise it in that is wrong I am a bastard child my self and i mean that in the since of my parents were not married when they had me but my mom was  and my dad was  and had just got out of the service neither had a job and they both came from a long line of alcoholics who made very little money most doing hard labor 	i am  I am not even graduated from high school my life is in so much chaos and uncertainty and i know i do not have the capability to be a mother nor should i have to carry the burden of someone elses decision within my womb 	0.9911945565870326

i believe abortion is wrong because abortion is not some women got raped or something and does not want to be reminded of it for nine months most of the time it is some one got pregnant and did not want to be so they kill the child for their mistake i wish a good debate to my opponent but i just do not see how you can agree with killing a child and taking it from its life just because the parents do not want it they are not disposable and abortion is not birth control and even if a women is raped its still going to effect her for the rest of her life anyway so why make the child suffer for a adults mistake and if the parents do not want it put it up for adoption abortion is pointless and unnecessary why take life from an unborn child for nothing 	with these two points clarified i think it is justified to say that even though i am pro the burden of proof is on my opponent to prove that  the federal government provides significant funding of non medical non abuse abortions through tax payer dollars and  the amount of federal dollars used to fund non medical non abuse abortions is not justified 	0.9926999140373992

it is not fair as i have had greater education experience than you and have lived through social issues that you have not experienced yet 	if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy existing because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy and this is true 	0.9864957135932143
 of abortions are in the first trimester so why should we completely outlaw it when the fetus is completely dependent on the mother in the uterus at this time cannot think anything or feel anything on its own 	 weeks which is the standard almost globally is well short of that meaning that according to our current science the fetus does not feel pain thus refuting a common argument that of the fetus feeling pain  my body my choice the fetus is completely dependent upon the mother while in the womb for its nutrition etc 	0.990570250850104
  pregnant teens die each year during childbirth and the babies have a  higher chance of dying as well 	i would argue for the childs in this case seeing as the mother has already lived and experienced life where as the baby did not even get that chance baby from beginning if you do not know this already you can research this 	0.9821129253309376
they will not be able to feed themselves or their children so why can not they have an abortion 	not all women are comfortable with being forced to have babies for other women they would rather not have children at all or not have children until they want them for themselve 	0.9851643832960706

it sounds like we have a concession 	good since infanticide does not because more good than harm if the above exhibits are seen as convincing then abortion should likewise be viewed as a net loss for society 	0.9625722491063693
this would suggest that a being only is subject to bodily sovereignty if it is sentient only reinforcing my point that it is sentience that is the determining fctor in the morality of abortion 	in the interest of time and attention i will for the first round attempt to confine my points specifically to those raised by the instigator 	0.9873756283711486

the fetus did not choose to be born out of it is own free will so you can not argue that the fetus as a sentient creature must observe bodily sovereignty of it is mother as it has no choice but to be in it is mothers womb 	closing arguments so with that let us look to the pro side of the debate pro first on the framework my opponent accepts the burden of proof but claims that it is abusive to say they must win all six of their points to win this debate 	0.9877652646849643
the man who is dying can not take the other mans heart because the other man is sentient as well and has an equal right to life a right that i agree the dying man can not violate 	though i can never imagine the feeling that a pregnant woman has i can imagine its not that pleasant but I am more then sure that there are women who have been raped but still had their child 	0.9922345227648496
i feel the man has the right to do so because the monkey is not intelligent in the same way as the man 	 my argument completely states that the law sees the baby as a human being and therefore avoid killing the mother until she completes giving nourishment to it p  p s   	0.9872955192889917
if a fetus is not self aware in the same way as a living human then why does it have the right to destroy the life of an intelligent living human 	the thing with abortion after the nervous system is pretty much fully finished developing is that at that point it really is a human being as in they can feel they have a working brain they can move 	0.9874302713505068
regardless of how anatomically similar it is to a person a fetus could be have more in common mentally with an animal then a mature adult 	allow me to just say that my next points referring to the slaughtering of animals and human babies of any development come from a biblical view and my faith that lies in god 	0.9841690918805984

so in conclusion it is the mental development of a fetus that determines the morality of killing it not the species 	that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness 	0.9856174356544504
i certainly am not treating children like animals assuming that means how animals more likely to be treated cruelly quite the opposite i am asking you and others to consider that it is fundamental we consider actions to prevent greater harm and suffering and always striving to reduce the need for any extremities to accomplish such goals 	this is a tragedy and if banning abortion does not reduce the abortion rate but instead increases the rate of unsafe abortions then making it illegal is immoral clearly i am sure my opponent will agree with me on this issue 	0.9921223892387014
and i must say i think your prognoses are ignorant of a vast amount of information on the subject this to me makes some of your positions seem very rude in considering all the aspects of these topics and how people deal with the agenda of abortion 	my argument is this  the moral position of one does not necessarily negate the moral position of another in a just society 	0.9913240228479385
 no females do not always have a choice in getting pregnant and based on your arguments against abortion you attempt to take chooses away from women by dismantling their basic right to choose to become a mother 	the most commonly cited reason for taking longer to get an abortion was inability to make arrangements quickly  and this reason was cited about twice as frequently by poor women guttmacher  	0.9901442747964
the issue is usually to what degree of suffering can be determined though it certainly is an open subject but abortion is not entirely depended on it such a proposition 	but disabled people are still autonomous because they are sentient beings and don t live inside the body of another person and suck up their nutrients 	0.9898144572404853

i am under the impression you are not even researching anything on the subject as your response are not well balanced to the data on reality 	killing the embryo cannot even be considering murder because the brain or nervous system has not be developed in the early stages and you have already agreed that abortion after rape is acceptable so you must not have any strong feelings on killing embryos at all 	0.9904661600497461
i explain my reasons here i am arguing that suffering is a good thing to reduce which i stated at the beginning of my elaboration on the conclusion 	argument  the value of human beings is not in the fact of life being a living organism but rather in the ability to have consciousness and experience pain and joy 	0.9886792328020705

quality of life after birth although abortion itself is not very pleasant we have to take into account the state of the parents are they financially stable 	while it is true that most people are still in favour of death penalty the fact that a substantial percentage of people are against it throws doubt into the morality of killing anyone as a punishment 	0.9885331950920274
when the baby has been developing for  weeks it is no longer applicable for abortion now although this is quite away into the development of the child it is highly unlikely that abortions will be carried out as they become unsafe and usually if someone has left the baby this long they intend to keep it 	first i want to establish that i will be focusing on the principle of abortion and thoroughly believe that the time when you can actually get an abortion should be decided by medical professionals and the women involved 	0.9903729066528105

finally you have no philosophical reasoning for demonstrating why it should matter that killing babies is wrong just because they are cute does not necessarily mean they are persons 	a batch of such reports might read something like this name dick tater age  analysis a dangerous manically depressive loner who exhibits an unhealthy obsession with guns and who is liable to walk into school armed with a high powered firearm and indiscriminately shoot students and teachers before turning the gun on himself but who is not intelligent enough to pose any serious threat to national security 	0.9920782347549659
the fallacy here is similar to the argument from silence which states that just because someone has not responded to an argument or claim does not mean that argument claim is true 	here an argument is made that the results of not acting to provide safe access to abortion only increases the harm done 	0.9879166176292484

 debate let the audience note my opponent has only addressed the cross examination section of my rebuttal 	as for the con attacking my position over the death penalty to nullify my argument there is a very outstanding difference between retrospective abortion and the death penalty death penalty the subject has already committed a terrible crime been found guilty of committing it and the state he was prosecuted in has decided to sentence him to death 	0.9827998917857826

my opponent ignores this entire paragraph from my last round but taking a step back for a moment I am still failing to see the difference between wearing a condom and aborting a fetus 	and personally it was horrific to see a baby squirming for its life when a vacuum was ripping it to pieces from inside do not mean an emotional appeal to be the foundation of my argument but i find that some merit can be drawn from this if you want to google it and see what I have seen 	0.9873748073314352

the answer is yes in  of all abortions the living content of the womb is killed 	none of this actions in and of themselves are ethically justified it is wrong to kill and it is wrong to steal but in light of the reason why they were stealing or why they were killing we accept it as a necessary evil 	0.9835826838301778

women should have the right to make decisions about their body the government should not be allowed to force a woman to carry a baby and live with the consequences of that for the rest of their life 	the mother would no doubt be scarred for life emotionally and as such may not be able to treat her offspring in the way in which it deserves to be treated 	0.9924298500802317

you are incorrect just because a fetus is part of its mother does not mean i has the same rights 	i do agree that such abortion cases must not be permitted but my opponent never made it clear in the previous rounds that she is arguing against those cases 	0.9833149963993868

a person and their doctor should be allowed to make the decision that they think will be right for their health and their future 	normally i would have to argue for either rape or the health of the mother as situations where abortion is permissible before going further but since the con has kindly yielded the health of the mother i will build upon that point 	0.9879754306073502
it is that persons individual choice to do what is morally right or wrong as long as they do not break the law 	and it is also very true that many people who do not follow a faith also are strongly against abortion and i would just like to point out that neither do i find it a pleasing nor happy concept that abortion is legal but i do strongly wholeheartedly understand that it is a completely necessary process just as was world war i and ii horrific dreadful but necessary to protect the world as we know it 	0.984685371089914

i think we can agree that no child should have to be brought up like this living their childhood in an orphanage without ever meeting their real parents 	but if a woman is raped rather than responding to violence with more violence we should work to help the woman get through such a traumatising experience rather than acting like it did not happen 	0.9869712773307046

my post this round will be extremely short because my opponent has not given me much to respond to 	my opponent utterly fails to prove why we should make such a drastic claim to the status quo and then demonizes me for opposing his opinions therefore i urge you all  in this debate simply because my opponent gives you no reason to vote for them 	0.9854841617215492
I am arguing that it is possible to determine if someone will end up like that when they are still in the womb 	the real premise that all my arguments come down to is a living being is not anything else while it is in development 	0.9875273745140123

in conclusion i have explained why the mothers life is more important that the fetuses and that in cases where the mothers life is put at risk abortion should be an open option i have explained why it would be morally wrong to allow some babies who have no consciousness and barely any brain activity to suffer through the hardships they will face in life i have explained that illegal abortions will occur and the results will be disastrous if it is not regulated by the government and i have refuted my opponents fetus versus baby contention 	  autonomy however even if we assume that all fertilized eggs fetuses have personhood equal to that of a birthed child and they would all choose to force their biological parent to carry the pregnancy to birth which i do not believe is a solid assumption based on the reasons given in  i still do not believe this is sufficient justification for denying a person the right to an abortion 	0.9936307079843999
in extreme cases such as when the mothers life is put in jeopardy the baby will likely die before any of this could be said about them and often times they will take the rational breathing thinking mother with them 	it would not really matter if what the sperm are doing is moral since in this example they are not sentient yet but still have the rights of babies 	0.9898694913675463
i am talking about when a person has limbs that are underdeveloped and they have no consciousness to begin with and they are simply a financial burden to the family 	i think so because machines can make a person function when they are clearly dead this creeps out family of the dead if they see it they do it for saving organs etc sometimes and if you start using machines one by one on a person their heart and brainwaives the things that make them clinically alive or not can be usurped by machines and later they are vital signs would be working again 	0.9927766613284708
first and foremost in cases where the life of the mother is at risk there is a large chance that the baby will simply die along with the mother so in predetermined circumstances where it is deemed likely that the baby will put the mothers life at risk it would simply be best to abort the baby no matter the stage of pregnancy as aborting the fetus will likely save the mothers life 	it would not really matter if what the sperm are doing is moral since in this example they are not sentient yet but still have the rights of babies 	0.993035579252112
it is fairly sad to see and it is best to spare the family the hardship of the countless medical bills and emotional trauma 	simple as that it is brain is not fully developed to meet such a criteria 	0.9868051268802145
because of the vague title i did all of this in the assumption that you were talking about all cases of abortion in general 	the only reason anyone would contest an abortion is because it is fatal to the fetus so if the fetus can survive the abortion i will not argue that it should be illegal 	0.9921852138556656
if the mother had two or three children after the initial abortion that could have killed her if she had not gotten it then in the end multiple lives were saved at the cost of having an abortion 	you should have the option to do whatever you like and other than the fact that the affirmative is clinging on the fact that i he loses on all other arguments and therefore if he cannot prove his case the vote should go to the negative in this debate 	0.9899286129519573

so instead of simply putting the title abortion you should have probably made it something more like abortion should never be permitted in any case in the united states or abortion should never be permitted in most cases in the united states then you could state the rare exceptions in the first round 	it is important to remind them that disabled people are still autonomous becausethey don t live inside the body of another person and suck up their nutrients 	0.9970505814198024
opening statements in round two i am going to argue that abortion should be permitted in cases where the mothers life is at risk where the baby will undoubtedly have major physical and or mental handicaps and before the fetus develops consciousness and the capacity to feel pain 	first of all when con says but provides no source defining how he was led to this conclusion nor does he back up this statement therefore it is a baseless opinion statement irrelevant as no evidence has been presented by my opposition that i can really accept as valid as there is not much i can rebutt from that statement which proves that its not really a valid argument 	0.9937572976655654
in all honesty i was reluctant to accept this debate as i seem to only debate big issues which can get a tad boring after a certain amount however i have not debated in rougly two months so i figure it is about time i get back into the game yes 	 sorry for the late response i just got a spike of homework so i did not have much time to do debating as con has taken the pro life side i will assume that i no longer need to argue that there are cases in which abortion is not ethical as we are in agreement on that so i will not rebut any of your rebuttals to my statements saying that abortion can be unethical 	0.9911846644354363
another key argument i will make is that the fetus cannot make rational choices so it is up to the mother who can make rational choices to decide the babys fate before consciousness and brain activity sets into the fetus 	 i assume that pro wishes to converge on the question because pro anticipates this would demonstrate that if life is said to exist then objectively it cannot be taken away 	0.9910781475377141
major diformities and if a young girl is raped who has a body too young to produce children and it is much too emotionally difficult for a young girl to give birth to a child anyway please note by young child i mean under  abortion can stop her from dying in birth and the child from having to carry with him that his mom is a dead  year old 	and everybody is not to live according to it part is also answer to i will be arguing that the woman should not have the choice to abort a child due our unalienable right to life and the very basics of our human dignity 	0.9827444246834108
i believe that a women should be allowed to do what she pleases with her body and it should not be in the goverments control 	if a mothers children or loved ones were being held hostage and the hostage taker threatened to kill them all unless she aborted the baby she was carrying then i do not believe it would be wrong of her to abort her child to save those she loved 	0.9862564995053267

if a women was not ready for the commitment yeah she should have tought about what she was doing but that does not me that she lost the ability to decided what to do with her pregnancy i do think their is a time when it should be consider inhumane but if the fetus have not fully developed i think that theirs not a big deal regarding wether a women decided to abort her child or not 	the point is that children should have a family who wants them and cares for them at the beginning and if the woman was forced to be a mother it is most likely that they do not desire the baby much less care for it 	0.9912019762455169

it is not by definition killing by that logic eating eggs is abortion and so is eating any form of seeds but noone blinks an eye at those thing so what is a big deal 	when the nazis killed millions of jews it was not because it was necessary to maintain bodily rights of the kind as argued for in the violinist analogy 	0.9805913818304839

most of us disregard that not everyone in life is perfect and daily we may do certain things that are not morally acceptable 	statistically speaking hardly any of the abortions committed had anything at all to do with her life being in danger or because of rape less than  are because of rape or incest 	0.9905961995320965

i do not care what if i go out there and murder a child infanticide then i do not think the government should intervene because they should leave it to the matters of the individual who is committing murder to a human being not to a person 	it does not matter if you are having a hard time following my arguement which i doubt because i did not put the period at the end of a sentence its the voters choice 	0.9924497431348072

given this all moral decisions should occur under the over encompassing shadow of this moral guideline since nobody wishes to suffer we should focus on maximizing freedoms while limiting harms so as to bring about the best possible reality for everyone 	this is impossible for con to do however as all modern medical research proves fetuses are not human beings 	0.9823829592639629
forcing someone into a physical state against their will when they have done no wrong is a violation of liberty and a great harm 	contrary to the opinion of anti abortion activists falsely called as they are against the right to life of the actual human being involved a woman is not a breeding pig owned by the state or church 	0.9897213664588327
therefore sentience is not the best means by which to determine the morality of abortion because it does not take into account the same level of freedom and harm prevention as the issue of bodily sovereignty does 	having another member of the family is extremely expensive i am sure there are stats on this but without internet i cannot check them and it should not be forced on people governments should stay out of the bedroom 	0.9906282341815698

there are many things we can do to make this optional 	as to whether or not such would extend to our furry friends i hope that all my talk of homo sapien life stages made that clear and though it is immaterial to my argument i do happen to think that those which can be shown to think and feel in some manner are sympathetic to people and that they are also often naturally deigned worthy of rights in a manner similar to that i sketched out for people 	0.9878218649688101

thus for those reasons as well as the fact that there has been no response to any of my arguments i would ask for a vote in favour of the con 	  economics one of the reasons a mother has an abortion is because the father walks out on her or she simply can not afford to have a baby at the time 	0.9871677206115022
both form a philosophical and a scientific perspective there really is no doubt about whether a fetus at any stage of pregnancy is a living human person 	my opponent s arguments are also flawed because under his logic a parent can simply stop providing for a very young child that can not take care of itself because we apparently have the right to stop providing others 	0.9917873567603529

when a society is no longer willing to protect the life of the most vulnerable of its members namely its unborn children then that society has certainly fallen to the lowest reaches of depravity 	yes i see your point on the matter however the problem is the fact that if the mother gets pregnant and the risk of dying in child birth exists than why should the mother put her life on the line for a child she does not even want at times which is feeding off of her body and may possibly have to grow up with conditions that would hinder it from ever entering society yes i perfectly open to admitting that abortion is murder because it has been observed that the fetus is in essence alive due to the fact that at proper conception nuclear fusion occurs and makes new cells however those cells are not necessarily capable of coherent thought thus the only thing that you are killing are a group of cells that currently are residing inside the mothers womb those cells which in essence are the same kind of cells we kill on a daily basis when we wash the floor or clean the dishes or clean the bathroom or anything we are trying to get clean almost always involves the murder of cells and or bacteria we just feel different about the cells residing inside the mothers womb because they will grow into a human in later development which is fair understandable but the child those collection of cells will grow into could develop horrible mutations in its genes or will have copying errors in its dna due to the lack of genetic diversity in the case of incest 	0.9911872287491604
even the most liberal and most pro abortion politicians and people in our country would i think be horrified if it were suggested that the killing of  year old children should be legalized 	if a defected fetus is kept and born into the world the fetus is already developed into a child who is carrying a bad pool of genes waiting to be released into our civilization which will halt the formation of a more improved human race 	0.9867497223800415
but i do argue that no matter how the child was conceived that its life is still just as valuable and therefore deserving of our protection 	i do not agree that a fetus has to pass some sort of milestone marker in order to gain value in this world because that would mean the fetus value depends on its ability to feel which is not at all a very scientific or ethical way to determine value 	0.9907796371147943
in the third criteria the ability to reproduce i would explain that cell reproduction is a common way for an organism to meet this requirement 	if abortion is murder reducto argument recall here how i argued that if you accept the abortion is murder premise and apply it consistency and follow it is logic where it gets you mass incarceration of woman death penalty where applicable who have had an abortion in the embryonic period 	0.984900111408763

third i do not feel that abortion should be completely wiped out i just feel that it should have more restrictions 	I will stop here and elaborate further on later if i must but here are some points of why retrospective abortion should not be allowed it might not protect the world from future tyrannical people who act like normal children in their early years this process could put to death thousands of children whose lives would not have caused the misery of millions childhood behavior does not foretell how they will act in the future many of the people who are infamous in history did not develop into who they became until adulthood the age limit of such a law could allow people who do act evil to escape the system parents may try to exploit the system to have their children aborted because they could not get an abortion before 	0.9860099255926523

definitions abortion judging from the oppositions first round it must then be defined that our abortion case is that of convenience abortion only not any incovenience abortion such as that of life threats rape and premartial pregnancy objections to arguments raise by oppositionsince we are talking about a cost analysis representation of then we shall clearly see that abortion is hamrful towards the let us make the assertion that a moral act cannot derive from an immoral act not that immoral acts can lead to moral acts in the future which is a possibility but that when something has origins in an immoral act then when the process goes on there is no possible way that any moral factor worth could be extracted from it or that the action could ever be morally justified 	i would also note that in the circumstances of late term abortions it is rarely a choice by the pregnant person to have such a late abortion 	0.9942886699408972
with this said the oppositions arguments for sexual freedoms inherently contradict the underlying logic of sex sex creates babies and that is the only moral and just type of sex that anyone could have 	as john lott notes he is a very respected man in the debate on both sides to understand why abortion might not cut crime one should first consider how dramatically it changed sexual relationships 	0.9924459038511094
like us assent to say that all those who go to convenient abortions are weak minded and have no place in society for they let their emotions control them on the fateful night when it should always be reason that controls them 	people have the right to have sex and sex does not always lead to a child and with modern technology of birth control and other forms of contraceptives it is not something that even has to be a part of the equation 	0.9893642582470161
if a person has sexual intercourse not for the sake of having a child but for the sake of pleasure then bears a child without any ideas of from pregnancy then firstly that is an immoral act 	the answer is far from simple but one must consider when searching for it that abortion if practiced at all should only be seen as a last resort 	0.9885112338380191
if the child was created for the sake of a side affair and pleasure then that is already immoral as an act and nothing that can follow it can be considered moral except for the conventional way of treating such conditionals 	statistically speaking hardly any of the abortions committed had anything at all to do with her life being in danger or because of rape less than  are because of rape or incest 	0.9875458640104791
here i am not arguing that since sex is beneficial everyone should have it but i am arguing that since in an abortion based concept sex has already been done then one should expect an off shoot and embrace it for humanity perhaps not mother nature will always benefit from another off shoot 	if abortion is murder reducto argument if it is the case that abortion in the embryonic stage is equivalent to murder as some anti choicers assert then that means all women who have had an abortion in that period should all be in jail doing sentences for murder maybe even the death penalty as well as any future women who will have an abortion in the embryonic period 	0.9928041937202273

firstly the first postulate to sexual intercourse is off shoot this is the only moral type of intercourse as their is a good will behind the action 	yes it is often said that one does bury their own grave and this is true just for about most choices in life but one that should stand at from this is whole ordeal is that there is no clear win situation for the mother 	0.9849468902781092
someone who wants a abortion is murdering a life depriving a life of what it may have become 	and personally it was horrific to see a baby squirming for its life when a vacuum was ripping it to pieces from inside do not mean an emotional appeal to be the foundation of my argument but i find that some merit can be drawn from this if you want to google it and see what I have seen 	0.9854010415012014
my second standing point is why would you have sex when you realized the risk of a pregnancy if you did not want such a thing then why did you not have sex with a condom birth control or both for all i care 	but we have this law called the right to life and i do not think we should make accpetions or give power to any individual to decided who is worthy of being a human and who is not in our society 	0.9874573187521024
some say you can not get depressed over something like an aborted fetus but aha your wrong 	your use of the terms unborn baby and killing must arouse certain emotions in you so as to distract you from the further consequences of your lack of action to prevent unneeded suffering and the emotional physical damages caused by those state of events 	0.9837241982029298
yea woman should be allowed to make decisions regarding their body but not for abortion they should watch how they dress and who they go to bed with as i said before use a condom if you do not want to get pregnant safety first 	also if this was true that doctors had to ask permission to abort the baby then we would be doing it with every abortion and since it takes so long that she would be dead anyway then we would have no babies being aborted and they would be all born 	0.9866837705685457
i understand that women have fought for their freedom but in this case abortion should not be illegal taken a life of a child is not right 	though i am not christian i respect and honor the christian beliefs and though i may not agree with all the catholic beliefs i do believe that abortion is wrong murder and whatever else you would like th call it but one thing is for sure it is not right 	0.9906876944637354
ok but that is a different story though if the mothers life is in danger it does not mean she is giving up on the baby and giving an abortion it means she has been hurt and it could effect the baby 	the only time that this might not happen is in cases of rape but this has been defined as no part of this debate in round  	0.9886407274218365

who ever got an abortion or is for abortion should deserve to get killed the same way they kill the poor inocennt babies i have no regert saying what i just said 	abortion whether therapeutic or illegal is in the main no longer dangerous because it is being done well by physicians  finally it is not as if women are forced to have abortions if they do then the problem to be solved is the fact that they are being coerced the vast majority are seeking an abortion out of their own free choice 	0.9905636802838332
the point of that story is that yes she could of got an abortion from the begging because the condition was obvious in ultrasound but she stuck by her baby and let it pass away when it was ready to she wanted god to take it on his time not at a scheduled time so i feel it should not be a popular as it is because people get an abortion because oh I am not to mature for a baby well you were old enough to have sex trust me your not going to tell me about hard I am  and got pregnant at  	i would say in that case you would be setting the baby free into the kingdom of heaven not arguing this but this is just food for thought in looking at it from a pro choice religious aspect and this is irrelevant beside the part that most pro life people are believers of god but since the debate has not gone to this topic and would be too late now I am going to rebuttal your points from your post and address the questions that you asked 	0.9912485258929056
