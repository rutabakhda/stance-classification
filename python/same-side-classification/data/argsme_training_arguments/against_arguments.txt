my argument is and has been this if we as a society are to weigh the value of life to all persons in making decisions then we must also consider the value of the life of the possible person inside the mothers womb 
 at the end of her comments dairygirl reminds us any differences of opinion we might have it seems would be an inherent value judgment call and tehres not much more to discuss 
 i think it is reasonable to think reasonably disputed life can be valued less than the freedom to choose 
 i also think incidentally that you could be personally against abortion but allow people to decide for themselves but only if you do not think it is certainly a person and are using the freedom issue 
am i understanding you simply put i believe dairygirls belief in early abortions to be reasonable for a person to hold who has not examined the full rationality of the situation 
 and none of these statements in any way provide justification for the implied assumption of her claim right to choose abortion value of life to society now it can be argued that i have given no justification for my argument that value of life infinite however this is irrelivent 
consequently these are the closing remarks so i shall mostly restate my argument attempt to answer  concerns and to demonstrate that although this debate missed round  for reasons of the holidary it should be inconsequential to the debate results because of the weaknesses inherent in dairygirls arguments 
 i acknowledge the society can have a say but I am simply saying if it says the laws are arbortion friendly it is rational not that it is analogous completely to areas where it can obviously exist 
 liberty value of life a very specific choice therefore in two rounds of debate dairygirl has presented no substantiation for her claims that a government can rationally legalize abortion 
 if you want to have a baby by all means proceed 
you seem to be pretty much admitting that if you do not want to risk pregnancy you can not do it 
almost no one goes to this degree but they could which shows some degree of culpability 
and the last reason it should be illegal in principal is because the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy 
the common arguments in favor of abortion should be used here as holistic approach to why she should be able to decide given the various moral considerations involved 
the pro and con about human life here are enough to say in principle we should defer to human life but not clear enough to make any meaningful punishments for it 
but on the other hand the earliest cell does meet the requirements for what would constitute an organism albeit it would probably be viewed as more like a parasitic organism given it must live off of the mother 
 aside from rape and mothers health abortion should be illegal in the first trimester but not investigated nor punished 
i would take that same reasoning though and argue that it is such a strong consideration that it should at least be illegal albeit with no legal consequences 
while the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy she may have tried her best not to get pregnant and got pregnant anyways 
for all the reasons i stated above we to defer to that putative person as a person because there is too many compelling reasons not to 
for all the reasons i stated above we treated that putative someone as a person but recognize the various factors in consideration and not punish 
but when it comes to potentially harming a putative someone else it becomes an issue for society 
as the pregnancy continues she assumes the issue more and more by not abortin when it is at least morally grayer 
i can understand if con thinks I am less persuative but my impression is that he is acting as if there is something more quantitative that I am missing 
no sane person would argue that the wrong doer should be able to kill the victim 
i do not see how con thinks the best interpretation is his guidelines because it is just contrary to good sensibilities of interptation and application 
he did not address my assumption of the risk point at least directly 
 claim coming from the pro is that there is no way to easily identify person hood 
i suppose we could take these standards being argued by myself and con as blurry 
plus if i were to want to get technical and play dirty it is not like burglars are without rights 
with sex the woman must understand that she is causing a sitaution where someone at least a putative someone will become dependant upon her for actions that she took 
perhaps this is sufficient for a secular mindset to not grant rights to that person but there is no necessary moral reasons we coud nt go further back 
he can disagree but he seems to be acting as if there is more I am not addressing that i in fact am addressing 
but we recognize the moral ambiguities and other considerations i gave in my first post and make the laws have no legal consequence 
so as a matter of deference to not wanting to kill people we should ban abortion 
I am not sure why con says i have not provided argumentation 
and the last reason it should be illegal in principal is because the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy 
the common arguments in favor of abortion should be used here as holistic approach to why she should be able to decide given the various moral considerations involved 
the pro and con about human life here are enough to say in principle we should defer to human life but not clear enough to make any meaningful punishments for it 
but on the other hand the earliest cell does meet the requirements for what would constitute an organism albeit it would probably be viewed as more like a parasitic organism given it must live off of the mother 
 aside from rape and mothers health abortion should be illegal in the first trimester but not investigated nor punished 
i would take that same reasoning though and argue that it is such a strong consideration that it should at least be illegal albeit with no legal consequences 
while the mother assumed the risk of pregnancy she may have tried her best not to get pregnant and got pregnant anyways 
i also know keeping the baby from the attacker is a crazy idea but i think the baby deserves the right to live like i said you could either have the baby and give it up for adoption or let someone else carry the baby and raise it up as their own 
i know what rape is like I have been raped it is hard to get over but if i had a child from the attacker i would keep it 
if i had an baby from my attacker and had an abortion i would not be able to live with myself after that 
i do not think abortion should be legal because no matter if it is unwanted you should give it up for adoption 
I am sixteen years old and i believe abortion is bad and unfair to the new life that you are bringing to the world 
you killing a baby is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life 
pro forfeited the entire debate 
if pro does not want to debate i will take points from full a concession 
and not even getting into much of anything in terms of actual substance in the debate for why it should or should not be that way etc 
con is just ranting it seems like about things that strike unjust to him but reading too much into the things to begin with and then blowing htem out of proportion 
but again I have said nothing that would indicate this 
you parents might actually be willing to support you if you knew 
there is no reason we can not have laws that are not enforced no matter what is customary 
it makes you wonder about whether he really has much to say in terms of substance at all 
semantics are always beside the point 
it would reflect that we see it as wrong but that we also recognize the difficulties involved so we do not wish to punish it 
the cost to make that sort of law would be de minimus in the bigger picture 
that could be argued to include money we could spend on something else 
the argument i actually made i essentially made the following argument in my affirmative speech that does not beg the question on positive rights but justifiably assumes their existence from moral experience lest i be charged with only arguing for positive rights in this conclusion if born children have a right to assistance or a positive right to life from their parents and unborn children have the same rights that born children have it follows that unborn children have a right to assistance from their parents 
if we can generally trust our five empirical senses even though we only assume they give us reliable information about the world then why not with the same confidence trust our moral sense that says persons are valuable and have intrinsic rights 
i do not feel any obligation to defend the first premise born children have a right to assistance from their parents because it seems obviously true to anyone with moral reasoning abilities 
but if you thought that the baby s right to be fed is incoherent because it denied her parent s so called right to self ownership and therefore it was moral for them to care for a virtual baby instead of their own child then i can confidently say that your moral sense is simply broken 
the declaration boldly states without need of philosophical justification the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world everyone has the right to life liberty and security of person 
con does not dispute the humanity or equality of rights present in the unborn because it was the debate resolution but he instead goes after a much larger metaphysical target for his rebuttal 
consider the following true story march   a south korean couple arrested for allowing their baby to starve to death had been raising an online child state media reported citing police sources 
therefore infants who are incapable of rational discourse but whose growth and development is necessary for it must be kept safe until they can fend for and protect themselves 
con is arguing for the ethical theory known as voluntarism or the claim that i have no duty to aid anyone else unless i freely say i want to aid them 
consider the universal declaration of human rights issued by the united nations just a few years after the unthinkable crime of the holocaust 
i contend that the right to life for persons is as self evidently true as the wrongness of trivial discrimination among persons 
because the woman has caused the fetus to need the use of her body and because pregnancy is an ordinary way we provide care to fetal persons unlike general organ donation then she is obligated to provide that care 
after all if i presented an argument in defense of concentration camp victims right to life to an ss officer while imprisoned at auschwitz my argument would still be correct even though i have no real freedom to present it or have it rationally considered 
we may not violate the property rights of other people if we hold discourse to be a rational means of normative inquiry 
but i provided compelling evidence that a fetus is a person and therefore this person would have property rights over his own body that an abortionist may compromise 
i believe con s argument fails to justify abortion rights because it requires us to assume the truth of premises that are even more controversial than the conclusion of the argument 
bu this clearly seems to be false and i can provide several examples to show that property rights are routinely curtailed in the interest of more compelling rights 
moral patients like animals fetuses infants the handicapped ecosystems or even future generations may not be able to act morally themselves but their nature may still require us to act morally towards them even if no contractual arrangement is arranged between either party 
the existence of such a right would automatically violate the negative right of self ownership of someone else through binding him to act in a certain way and would therefore be unacceptable 
when conducting an argument the parties only assume that laws of logic such as a a or a statement cannot be true and false at the same time in the same sense are true 
point  freedom and arguments while premise one is obviously true it is not true that an argument itself depends on the freedom of the arguers premise two 
if you believe that this baby has a positive right to be cared for because they were created by a moral agent then i cannot see how a fetus is not entitled to similar care 
 i own my speech intellectual property and the body that utters it but the you s supreme court ruled in  that even a basic freedom like speech can be curtailed in the interest of public safety 
these rights can never be violated if rational discourse is to be maintained 
pain perception some humans such as those in comas or the disabled do not feel pain but we recognize their general right to live 
there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being and the same is true of the most profoundly and irreparably intellectually disabled human being even of an infant who is born anencephalic literally without a brain 
 human fetuses have a right to live   premise  abortion directly kills an innocent human being  abortion violates the fetus right to life and is therefore immoral   con may argue that the unborn child s right to life is not violated because they have no right to use their mother s body without her consent 
as philosopher francis beckwith argues the pro life view is that human beings are persons in community and have certain natural obligations as members of their community that arise from their roles as mother father citizen child and so on 
while children may not have a right to extraordinary care like the donation of a parent s organs pregnancy is the universal means to provide unborn humans with the basic necessities of food water and shelter 
they claim that the ability to feel pain have rational thought or live independently outside of the womb are necessary conditions for personhood that fetuses lack 
a human fetus after all is simply a human being at a very early stage in his or her development 
david boonin author of a defense of abortion writes perhaps the most straight forward relation between you and me on the one hand and every human fetus on the other is this all are living members of the same species homo sapiens 
 finally even at the earliest stages a human embryo is a whole human organism on a path of self directed development 
in contrast many animals for example pigs feel pain but are not given the same right to life that human beings have 
  the right to live and receive care from their parents is not dependent on the born or unborn child s level of development or degree of dependency but on his or her identity as a member of the human species 
premise  fetuses are human beings or members of our species this premise is held without significant controversy in scientific philosophical and legal arenas 
for example embryology textbooks used in medical schools affirm that fertilization a k a conception is the first landmark in the development of a human being 
con will argue that the fetus is a person with said rights but that abortion is still morally acceptable 
 pregnancy does always have medical risks but the mother agreed to take those risks because she had sex with a man and knew their was a possibility of pregnancy 
in lack of a mutual consensus the dog owner mother should have to stick to her end of the deal and preserve the dog because she entered a mutual agreement with the other dog owner father to take care of this dog when they purchased it had sex 
when we entered an agreement to mutually buy a pet symbolic of sex we accepted that we each had to do our part to ensure that whatever came out of this purchase of an animal was indeed mutual 
requiring a woman to take unnecessary risks with her life and body and pregnancy always greatly increases medical risks just because the man who ejaculated into her says that she must is indicative of slavery and a blatant infringement upon her rights 
proof of this is the fact that our legal system does not require the father to pay child support to a woman while she is pregnant with the fetus 
 the father does not have a say in abortion because abortion is about the womans right to choose not the mans right to property 
another question if this dog is both truly ours and just happens to be residing in your home at the moment what gives you the right to kill it without by permission 
 as for my opponents sole argument i agree that the fetus belongs just as much to the father as it does to the mother 
simply because the fetus resides in the mothers body does not giver her any more rights over the fetus because a fetus is not a part of the mothers body 
however to force a woman to utilize her body in certain ways against her will is a violation of her legal rights 
last time i checked a father is a person and according to my opponent a person has rights 
as such the mothers body does not belong to the father and therefore the father has no jurisdiction over what the mother subjects her body to 
similarly both the mother and father are equally the parents of this child and therefore have equal rights when it comes to determining the interests of the child 
however a few things must be kept in mind 
resolution in regards to non medical abortion a contract should have to be signed by the mother and father of the fetus stating that they both consent to the abortion 
that is all for this round i look forward to this debate and thank whoever accepts it 
 arguments  the fetus belongs to the mother just as much as it does the father 
when you create a debate it is your responsibility to make sure that you can completely finish it without forfeiting 
in fact abortion ought to be illegal expect in those three situations which i gave in my first round 
pro has not successfully refuted this argument and his objections to it are all flawed and very weak as i clearly showed when i refuted them 
more importantly does the fact that the world is harsh justify killing a fetus and thereby depriving it is right to become a fully grown human like us and have a life and a future like us 
 rebuttal so pro is arguing that it would be better for the entire world and the people that reside upon it for that person to not be born because many people in the world have not enough food to eat and because many people have diseases like choleria etc 
the fact that our world is harsh does not give us the right to deprive the fetus right to become a fully grown human being like us and have a future and a life like us and nor does it justify it 
i have given a non religious but also still a reasonable reason i e the future argument refuting some of the most common objections to it as to why abortion should be illegal 
there are many theories published though out the years stating a wide range of populations that the world would be able to sustane from one million people to one trillion 
in  the united nations food and agriculture organisation released a report stating that there are  million poeple without enough food to eat 
thus pros claim which is also the title of this debate that there are no non religious reasonable arguments for abortion to be illegal is false and refuted 
i know it sounds harsh it sounds harsh to me too but the cold hard truth is that it would be better for the entire world and the people that reside upon it for that person to not be born 
moreover even if a fetus is not a person yet I am saying yet since the fetus will become and has the full potential to become a person does that mean that it does not have the right and chance to become a fully grown human person and have a life and future like us 
 since fetuses have the same kind of future that we do and will become fully grown humans like us and since it is wrong to kill innocent humans and to deprive them of their futures it follows that it is wrong to kill fetuses and thereby rob them of what is of the greatest value to them their own life and future 
i will however argue that even if a fetus is not a human yet it has the full potential to become one 
therefore i will only refute the  most common objections to this argument 
however the right to self ownership cannot justify killing a fetus which will become a human being and have a future and life like us 
the fetus will become a human so by killing it you are not even allowing it the right to become a human and have a life 
thus if you do not allow women to take abortion you are denying womens rights on their freedom of choice 
don marquis probably the founder of this argument says the effect of the loss of my biological life is the loss to me of all those activities projects experiences and enjoyments which would otherwise have constituted my future personal life 
moreover even if the fetus does not feel pain when it is being killed that does not justify killing it and depriving it is right to a life and a future 
thus even if a fetus is not a person or a human yet it should still not be killed and deprived of it is chance and right to become a person and a human being 
after that i will refute some of the objections to this argument 
in fact if you had killed me when i was a fetus i would not even have the chance to be here right now and talk to you 
you are basically taken ones right to even have a chance to live have a life and a future 
if someone kills a human being he or she will get in prison their whole life or at least in a very long time 
that however does not mean anything more than that it puts the womans personal interests and comfort above the value of a unborn babys life 
i however do not think abortion should be illegal if  the womans life is in danger  if the woman was raped and  if the fetus is very bad and I will meaning that it will probably die anyway 
every human being obtains the rights granted to the human race under natural law as soon as the human life cycle starts 
this debate forced me to think in ways that i never thought before because i have never discussed abortion without involving the moral code laid out in my religion 
under this natural precedence a womans right to life 
as i pointed out in   the first things that develop from a fertilized brain are the heart the brain and the spinal cord 
his her conduct was a lot better than anyone else who i have had this discussion before with and i really appreciate that 
there is no doubt that a society can make statutory laws to define how the government will protect life 
using statutory law principles here for a moment the act of commission in consensual sex in rape the act of commission rests with the rapist took place completely at the behest of the woman 
a miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy in the first  weeks sometimes referred to spontaneous abortion in medical journals why do they occur 
counter to   inevitability with all due respect to pianosandwich arguing that unintentional miscarriages that a human does not have control over can somehow be used to justify a deliberate termination of human life abortion is to completely eliminate the divide between natural forces and deliberate human interference 
otherwise a law becomes simply a set of ideals that humans can choose to ignore at their pleasure 
between  and  of first trimester miscarriages normally are the result of chromosomal abnormalities in the egg other reasons may include an egg that didn t implant properly in the uterus or an embryo that had structural defects 
response to  personhood pianosandwich with the utmost respect i must point out that pianosandwich made a critical mistake in regard to the natural right to life in his counter 
she can only follow the advice of her doctors to ensure the most successful pregnancy possible 
according to the encyclopedia britannica natural law is defined as follows regardless of the statues that a society can pass natural law applies to every form of human life 
in engaging in this debate i will draw heavily upon my own biblical beliefs as well as scientific facts that i believe prove the sacred truth regarding the sanctity of every human life 
when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg they combine to make one living cellular organism and the human life process has started at the moment of conception 
  bringing together all of the evidence i have outlined in the previous sections a fetus is scientifically a human being 
i shall endeavor to conduct this debate in the spirit of civility maintaining politeness while being candid despite the controversial nature of the subject 
what moral basis do we have for terminating the life of an unborn child whose only was to exist as the result of someone else s evil deeds 
however doctors and biologists can see enough through modern technology to tell us that a fertilized egg has an anatomy of cells 
we have no moral basis before god or in scientific laws to take the life of a human being that has not even interacted with others yet 
the strict biological definition of anatomical life is a structured form of living matter that is visible to the naked eye margulis  
i am assuming that the main scientific debate between pro and me will occur over the issue of cellular life versus anatomical life visible life forms 
consequently the fertilized egg must be classified as an anatomical form of life which represents the start of the human life cycle 
each of these can distinctly be seen by week four of a woman s pregnancy therefore the developing fetus is not a mass of tissue 
if the people seeing this are going to vote according to technicality you win by far but if their judging on who actually cares and who is morally sound 
about infanticide i said that it would be only logical to assume harmless little   and  trimester abortions would lead to that 
i do not think our founding fathers would if ever possible look into the future and enjoy seeing the fetal products of their hardwork sucked out and utterly destroyed 
but i do not think its right my reason being that i feel it will lead to something much worse that you might not support but these infanticidophilic people will use your same arguments against you 
i clearly said i think if a woman is raped she should be given a choice 
again i think if a woman is raped in all politically correctedness she should be able to have an abortion 
in that case if i find some hobo that no one loves morally i could stab it blow it up anything i want right 
if you were raped i think constitutionally you should be given the choice of abortion but i wish gov t would strongly advertise having the baby and giving it to families that are unable to have children 
you do not know the limits of humanity and i think the value of a human life is worth so much more than you are making it in your argument 
I am not saying that parents can deny an abortion if a doctor requests it I am just saying that parents should be involved in the process 
you cannot say or well i think that parents are certainly more educated in the field of abortion when compared to their teenage daughters 
abortions could leave to future ectopic pregnancies a mother has a  chance of dieing in an ectopic pregnancy women who abort are  more vulnerable to breast cancer abruptio placenta which is when the sac holding the baby the placenta tears away from the uterine lining 
opponent i will simply disagree with the pros argument that parents can be better judges than physicians in regards to when a medical abortion is necessary to terminate an I will pregnancy that can physically harm the child 
and judges complete strangers should not be able to dictate to parents what is in the best interests of their children 
women who have experienced abortion have a  increase in their risk for abruptio placenta in future pregnancies emotional distress including acute feeling of grief depression anger fear of disclosure preoccupation with babies or getting pregnant again nightmares sexual dysfunction termination of relationships emotional coldness increased alcohol and drug abuse eating disorders anxiety flashbacks of the abortion procedure anniversary syndrome repeat abortions suicide many of these women go on to report that they regret their choice and would do anything to go back and undo the decision that resulted in so much pain 
and children in my opinion and i am a child cannot represent themselves adequately when it comes to such mature matters like abortion 
i believe that all parents know what is in the best interest of their children no matter what the circumstances 
and even if children are of making this decision that does not mean that the parents should be silenced 
children are children they are naive ignorant and a lot of the time do not know their best interests 
i do understand that abortion can be life threatening which is exactly why children should not be left to tend to it 
children are not capable of making any decisions for themselves without the input of their parents 
since a minor is still being cared for by the parent then parents have to right to either grant or not grant an abortion without input from their daughter 
minor someone under the age of  i believe that minors should be required to get permission from their parents to receive an abortion 
if that is your sole argument then i believe we are indeed finished and by my laws which say that these internet laws are not worth nil when it comes to debating i will proclaim myself the winner since you appear to have no better argument 
they seem good for a fun game but when it comes to real debating then i want a real debater with real reasons for their argument 
I am trying to have a meaningful debate where the opponent makes a far better argument than some silly internet tradition 
like I have said in my first post first between the nazis attempt to justify their murder by dehumanizing their target and liberals claiming that unborn children are not human which of course they are as one of their main justifications for their malicious deeds 
ok first off with your do you know if it refers to topics where hitler and the nazis is the original subject of the conversation 
because it would be ridiculous if a conversation went like this guy a gee adolf hitler was a mean guy 
maybe i should have just said abortion is similar instead of identical to nazi ideologies 
i was saying they are like nazis only for the abortion holocaust comparision 
a black defendant on trial for murder is  more likely to be given they death penalty than a defendant of any other race and nearly  of all victims in death penalty cases are white despite the fact that whites make up only about  of all murder victims 
also killing a person that has shown a they have no respect for another persons right to live is actually defending life 
being opposed to abortion saying it is murder to kill a child that is alive and growing inside you that you created is very pro life 
if we had a standard for the death penalty like any type of murder results in the death penalty which is to be carried out within a year or after their first and only appeal 
think about the lifers in prison they are the most dangerous people in that prison simply because they have nothing to lose 
the death penalty is a penalty it is not a random thing they do not pull people off the street and execute them on a whim 
but another thing that is typically liberal is to accuse everything they do not agree with as being racist 
saying that  people could have been wrongfully executed is not a reflection of the death penalty in any way 
conservatism is giving people a lot of freedom but holding them responsible for their actions 
china executes around  people a year and they have a low violent crime rate 
you say finally one more argument against the death penalty states that its application is unequal and discriminatory 
rather than execute them you would have them being a danger to other inmates as well as guards 
i also have a definition for you hypocrite  
how can you want to snuff out an innocent life yet want to let an evil person that has proved to society that they are willing to kill others live out his life 
i went through profiles of people i disagreed  or more on and most of them were liberal in favor of abortion and against the death penalty 
only in favor of killing those that can not defend themselves and opposed to killing people that would murder others 
i do not see where you get the stats you claim from that link 
given your propensity to make up things as in your first post i would not be surprised if you are stretching the truth of what you found in your second post 
as of now i concede the argument and you win 
 at  that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors physical emotional psychological familial and the womans age relevant to the wellbeing of the patient 
an abortion is necessary is a professional judgment that the georgia physician will be called upon to make routinely 
so to keep with the snpirit of roe v wade legally more regulations should exist in the third trimester 
it is actually proved that   women who want to do abortion but see the baby through the ultra sound decide against their abortion plan 
the law is justified in those late term cases and here too in not extending absolute right 
the law i am contending just does not go far enough it does not require the baby to be removed safely if possible 
no one has an absolute right to kill someone just because tehy are on their property etc 
healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother or trivial reasons when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed 
 to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do 
in cases where mother wants abortion or to be free from the baby but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted 
even if we accpet your premise that the mother has an absolute right to evict them 
you like almost everyone who takes ths debate is arguing against soemthing i do not even say 
I am just arging they should be safely removed if healthy 
healthy viable babies who can live outside the mother should not be aborted just removed 
the police do not come and shoot trespassers on your property they come and tak them away 
even if it were accepted that it is unjust to destroy a fertilized egg which i do not grant it is greater injustice to violate the rights of the woman to govern her own body 
neither pro nor anyone else would allow a child to be killed at age three on the grounds of the child being the product of a rape 
from the viewpoint of society this is a substantially greater injustice than terminating a fertilized egg 
if human worth can be degraded then morality has lost meaning 
for example there is a clear distinction between a person being struck by lightning compared to a person shot in the face 
when pro grants the exception to allow abortion over concern for the health of the woman pro grants that the woman has a greater right to live than the unborn 
pro illustrates by claiming that there is a right against that exists independent of human rights 
since i have proven that a a fetus is a human he concedes to the dna argument b a fetus is a being proven by definition you can now extend this and use it as a drop to his case that the fetus is indeed a human being 
a fertilized egg is both within the woman and cannot survive independently of the woman therefore it part of the woman 
i e only social abortions second yes dna does make up a human third the clash comes down to the idea of 
thus if rights are in conflict the rights of the woman supersede 
 basically my opponents logic means that it would be justified to kill a child even after he she was born because he she could not be properly cared for 
pro implicitly acknowledges that fertilized eggs are not human beings by providing the exception for rape in his assertion 
first the resolution implies an obligation we must evaluate the resolution based from that standpoint 
however it is not unjsut to incarcerate that rapist because it does not violate any human worth 
the affirmatives advocacy is not that abortion is a violation of rights rather the advocacy is that killing any type of human without due because is dehumanization 
this definition can only apply because justice is based on human worth itself and what is due to a specific person 
this is an appropriate evaluative standard because justice is what giving each their due is 
second even if you look to the argument it still is inferior because rights come from human worth 
i do however point out that a reasonable interpretation of pros offer is that under those circumstances reason would be allowed to prevail 
a fertilized egg can feels nothing therefore the level of violence is nothing this is wrong for two reasons first if someone was numb all over and then killed you can infer from my opponents logic that that is not a violent crime 
third positive rights argumentation does not impact the resolution in so far as my structure determines the impaction 
first since there is no universal definition of human being we must breakdown the word itself and then come to a logical conclusion 
argument  this argument comes down to a standard evaluation 
second my opponents logic leads to the fact that once a fetus develops a nerve system then it is a violent act to abort 
to mitigate possible heinous crimes the fetus must be presumed as living just in case it is 
apparently one can completely fail to respond to an argument  not know how to look up a definition and claim arbitrary nonsensical value criteria yet still claim victory 
everyone can agree that this is a terrible waste of life and potentially very dangerous for the mother concerned and of course many people object strongly to abortion on moral grounds 
give me  reason why we should keep it 
hell yeah it should be banned its murder simple 
yes not all women have friends and family they can turn to but there is bound to be programs to help her 
i hear people saying that once there is a heart beat or a brain wave the life is official but says who 
a dead person can have a heart beat and brain activity for hours sometimes days after his death does that mean hes still alive 
if there is a chance that the being in question is alive more harm would be done by killing it than to let it live 
if you are pregnant and your child develops cancer in the womb the longer its in there there is more of a cahnce the cancer spreads to you via blood stream 
the reason abortion is and always should be legal is a matter of the personal right too make a choice 
  economics one of the reasons a mother has an abortion is because the father walks out on her or she simply can not afford to have a baby at the time 
even if the answer of child support is there is no way she could ever get it what about in family adoption 
i know you seem to think adoption is an easy option and in some circumstances it may be but certain places both in the us and around the world do not have adequate adoption facilities programs so they could be made similarly to an unheathy babies 
if the father walks out on her she can get child support if they were married can she not 
void you do not have to tell the child he is adopted infants are more likely to be adopted than any other age group anyway 
also anybody who is capable of going through the first two trimesters without an abortion does not need one in the third trimester 
even if you do not believe abortion is murder you should believe that if at the time you get the abortion the child can be alive that should classify as murder 
in certain situations abortion is appropriate but if they are so young and its not rape its there own fault 
are not you going to counter argue 
abortion is just not practical what is the point in killing your offspring inside of its carrier 
better yet think about it before you lay your head down tonight 
but i believe that above all if you are not willing to have a child do one of the two a use a condom 
people find it ok do do a sick thing killing children before they are even born 
where dilation and extraction is performed without inducing partial birth then it has the potential to be just as safe for the mother 
no sane person would say the victim should be able to be terminated 
why is it not okay to kill a second outside the womb when a second earlier inside the woman it was anything goes 
that the doctor might use pain killers etc does not detract from the fact that he has killed the baby and the other arguments we are having 
i acknolwedge that late term abortions esepcially are done by far for health reasons of the mother and such 
 why would we legalize the latest most trivially based abortions just because the mother might do it anyway 
yet you state that with late term abortions they do not feel pain etc 
you have to be willing to accept that abortion a week before the due date is okay even if a commonly thought of exception does not apply 
no sane person would say the victim should be able to be terminated 
that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not 
the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply 
a reasonable person would say the tortfeasor must at least wait a few months until they can be separated 
please note most sane commentators to this debate say i am giving myself too much discretion that it is not fair for that reason 
so for this debate you must accept that a woman should be able to abort a week before her due date even if she does not have a commonly thought of exception like rape or mothers health 
he has not made one single valid argument to challenge the law of hindered birth or to prove that it does not partially govern the impact that abortion has on society 
however it is quite obvious that liberty is clinging to this with all the fervor of a religious zealot who will not change his mind on anything despite all the evidence to the contrary 
did he even ready my arguments or is he simply arguing based on what he assumes i will say 
 this does have to do with the law or the woman because if the unborn are living humans then killing them because they are unwanted is barbaric 
i have proven that the unborn are living humans and have supplied ample evidence from embryologists the experts in the field who tell us that a new unique human life is created at conception 
your resolution does not state that the law governs the morality but that it governs it 
he has not responded to my arguments and he has certainly not proven any of his alleged or the resolution at large 
 this does as you made the claim that no one or very few people think my ideas are valid 
why would we treat the unborn the same way if the are living humans like you or more 
you have not offered proof therefore you can not make the claim that my views are invalid simply because you disagree with them 
in fact liberty has not supplied one expert who claims that life is instead he equivocates 
you seem to be worried about the one that will make it through and survive and not the other fetuses who will be miscarried or flushed out 
if a woman gets pregnant with her lover and does not want the child her situation is not likely to drastically change in nine months to where she would want a child 
if you can not tell the unborn are human because they might not be born then you can not tell if a newborn is human because it might die of sids before it reaches adolescence 
 this does have impact on the debate since you yourself have stated that life is and the potential wanted fetus is a human while the unwanted fetus is mere 
they deal in what is true and observable 
 it does as you have made the claim that by keeping the unwanted child the wanted one will 
one way to tell a law and a theory apart is to ask if the description gives you a means to explain why 
as i read my opponents final round argument i have to ask myself and i suppose the reader will also ask themselves if givemeliberty and i even read the same debate 
also if wanted childrens lives are being lost during unwanted pregnancies do you think women should become perpetual baby making machines so that the fewest possible number of children will live 
you are killing the life of a child already in existence for one that may or may not happen 
yet no one would say it is okay to kill a toddler because the mother suddenly does not want them anymore 
even in the case of rape as i have indicated this is not a good reason to kill the unborn child as i have already made the case for 
there is no reason to expect that if they are aborting their child because of other factors i e job school etc that their situation will drastically change in nine months and they would want to have a child then 
here I will quote a couple more human development begins at fertilization the process during which a male gamete or sperm unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to form a single cell called a zygote 
but let us recap the resolution that we are debating is 
again it is irrelevant that there is no consensus as to when life begins 
i confess i have no idea what you were trying to show me with your first link from religious tolerance 
the as he calls it would not be to save the life of the wanted fetus because in order to do that the already conceived unwanted fetus must die 
please find me an embryologist who is an actual expert in the field who says we can not know when life begins 
in fact your entire argument is ridiculous because you are making the case that we are only valuable if we are wanted 
however if the girl woman is worried about poverty or any other reason she can always gift the child to a loving couple for adoption which is much better than having the child killed 
my position that life begins at fertilization is much more consistent than your position that life begins at birth because birth is an arbitrary event 
 keith l moore before we are born essentials of embryology  edition philadelphia pa saunders  
this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual 
pro apparently thinks that keeping an unwanted child will always result in not being able to have a wanted child with her lover 
hill recognized is that believing the unborn to be fully human from the moment of conception requires an acknowledgement that they also are entitled to the same actions one would take to defend any other human being 
while most would be abortive women are understandably reluctant to come forward and state that violent action saved their childs life there is at least one notable exception 
if we knew that we or our loved ones were about to be killed as thousands of unborn children are each day we would defend one another with the means necessary 
if questioned we would assert the moral necessity of taking this action 
we would not limit ourselves to legal and educational remedies that might possibly stop the bloodshed in the future rather we would take the immediate action necessary to save one another 
i will be arguing that the use of physical force to defend the unborn is legitimate and morally justified 
 los angeles times june   agree  disagree which of these statements comes closer to your opinion abortion is the same thing as murdering a child or abortion is not murder because the fetus really is not a child 
we are not debating whether or not abortion should be legal or whether or not the majority of americans would have it banned in any or all circumstances 
given four categories to choose from a combined  indicate abortion is murder while  say it is not murder very similar to the gallup s  findings 
the morality of abortion asked about the morality of abortion in general americans are evenly divided  told gallup in a may  survey that abortion is morally acceptable while  answered that it is morally wrong 
time cnn august   murder  do not feel this way a unique question asked by the center for survey research at the university of virginia explored americans feelings about abortion as murder in greater detail 
university of virginia january  murder as bad as killing person already born  murder not as bad as killing a person already born  not murder does involve taking human life  not murder is a surgical procedure for removing human tissue  no opinion  this article shows that the majority of americans believe that abortion is murder 
however as can be seen about one fifth of those who consider abortion murder make a distinction between abortion and killing a person who is already born 
the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse 
the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse 
the only way to become pregnant is to have intercourse 
i feel it is intellectually dishonest when people argue against the death penalty but are in favor of late term abortions 
in the same way actions that are considered are those that do not reflect the actions of someone who has a relationship with god or at least the judeo christian perception of god 
conclusion even if the fetus consents abortion must be regarded as immoral 
murder by the definition of morality provided cannot be moral and must be regarded as immoral 
according to this clause the fundamental human rights of life liberty and property should not be infringed without due process of law last i checked the woman is not judge jury and executioner an abortion clinic is not a court of law and is not a legitimate violation to constitute the death penalty 
and you dropped my point in regards to the  amendment just because it grants protections to a group of people does not mean that all other groups are excluded and as i stated before the  amendment insures this right to all persons 
either way a chinese person is still a person 
a person is a human being some thing with a complete human genome as well as a functioning system of organs 
the  amendment says that people are citizens by being born in the us because you can know when someone is born not when they are conceived and it does not deprive protections to people not born in the us it only guarantees them to those who are 
if i went to china and murdered someone then came back to the us and got caught I would get arrested even though it was not an american citizen 
abortion reduces crime no corelation is not causation besides i could point out a different coorelation which shows the opposite in switzerland the abortion rate is  
the bat lewis carroll twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what you are at 
 whistles aimlessly still no argument from con 
according to the marriam websters dictionary a human is a bipedal primate mammal homo sapiens man broadly hominid hu man like listen to the pronunciation of humanlike m n l k adjective and it defines a fetus as an unborn or unhatched vertebrate especially after attaining the basic structural plan of its kind specifically a developing human from usually two months after conception to birth and the definition of develop we can look at  a to go through a process of natural growth differentiation or evolution by successive changes b to acquire secondary sex characteristics now to argue my opponents case 
a few more things my opponent should consider before his rebuttal  
what one must realise and what will help in my point against my opponents abortion claim is that there are enumerated rights and prenumbral rights 
now let us go to how griswald could even have rights in the first place 
from  ct had a law that made it a crime punishable by fine or prison to use distribute or advise the use of contraception 
so the court was claiming that marital privacy is a penumbral constitutional right implied in the     and  amendments 
should we arrest women who have abortions preformed so they will not die during labor have massive physical damage or psychological damage 
to have full american rights you must first be an american citizen 
should we not preform abortions on a fetus that is grotesquely abnormal 
you argue that abortion only endangers the lives of   women and that it decreased 
all arguments notwithstanding i do not feel that con deserves or merits votes in this debate due to his sheer disrespect of this community 
 you do not see how the points are relevant to the argument even though you admit that legalized abortions are now safer than ever 
that said akmath has also moved the goal posts of this debate though i must admit i got caught up in it a bit as well focusing a lot on when life begins and the viability of fetuses rather than the issue at hand whether legalized abortion has done more good than harm 
you also say that guttmacher institute considered abortions to be safe  years ago 
yes they are saving money by not providing a range of services such as foster care education welfare and the adoption of children who have physical and mental disabilities 
perhaps you also think it is wise to save money by not funding research and development into the cure of deadly diseases 
again you have cited but not told us what that refers to 
even if you already knew this statistic it is possible voters did not and that does not change the relevance to the topic 
now a few quotes to combat this exhibit from scholarly sources compared to states that support women s health those states that oppose safe and legal abortion spend far less money per child on a range of services such as foster care education welfare and the adoption of children who have physical and mental disabilities schroedel  
 about half of all pregnancies in the you s each year are unintended and four in  of these are ended by medically safe legal abortions 
however if the terrorist as terrorists often do forced his or her way into the space station and used violence to place this bomb in joes hand surely it would not be fair to force him to die over this 
this example would perhaps be applicable if joe invited the terrorist over for dinner a game of chess and to watch breaking bad 
can not the same be said for the all the sperm that do not fertilize a given egg 
today  percent of the abortions in the you s are provided to women over  and to teenagers cdc  
 the states that have the strongest laws against safe and legal abortion are also the states in which women suffer from lower levels of education and higher levels of poverty as well as from a lower ratio of female tomale earnings 
you essentially claim that the good of the self is what makes natural morality i say that this proves you have a misunderstanding of what morality traditionally means and probably lack any understanding of contemporary evolutionary theory on the matter 
 the babes in question ought not be treated as persons and your lack of demonstration of such reasons their extermination ought logically to be as abhorrent as was that perpetrated by hitler 
behavior is extremely regular there is logical evolutionary benefit there is strong evidence to call behavior natural if you look to my argument that human rights are products of our natural qualities you will see that it is logical and based off of premises which are evident that is that reason feeling and interaction are natural qualities of people 
correction i did not say emotional feeling and reason develop but that the rights do human rights of which i speak 
however those that do not are felt to be abhorrent and immoral by people who have a full knowledge of the facts that is including knowledge that there is no reason to think of jews gays etc as sub human being that as i stated in arg 
as to your argument of population control though i am generally of the opinion that such detached weighing of outcomes is not a practice largely because i think it obvious that morality comes from a combination of natural feeling and reason and though perhaps such weighing is logical and so in some sense i find it that i feel it is abhorrent i must argue that even if one feels morally compelled to weigh matters of importance as such that the abolition of late term abortion does not because one to completely abandon the idea of population control as types of effective contraceptives are many and early abortions quite easy to carry out 
many people look to the supernatural to provide an explanation as to how we are in some way different from the rest of nature and bound by laws in how we treat one another though this argument would in one way provide a source for these rights being that such an assertion is quite beyond my reasoning capability i will not try to tackle it 
secondly i did not define a because i am not absolutely certain as to whether or not i would wish to confine the definition to only those stages of homo sapien development which are capable of thought 
as to whether or not such would extend to our furry friends i hope that all my talk of homo sapien life stages made that clear and though it is immaterial to my argument i do happen to think that those which can be shown to think and feel in some manner are sympathetic to people and that they are also often naturally deigned worthy of rights in a manner similar to that i sketched out for people 
my careful wording is because i believe that the argument that brain dead bodies are dead bodies and not really what we mean when we say has some merit and i do not wish to argue against it 
pro life people argue that unborn children have rights that must be protected as well i would argue that since late term unborn babies are developed to a level of physiological complexity at which thought can occur their is no reason whatsoever that they ought not be treated as persons and be acknowledged as having human rights 
i acknowledge that women have a right to privacy and to act in regard to their body but submit that in this kind of case in which two peoples rights conflict they must be measured and balanced 
in measuring the two parties rights it becomes quite clear that simply allowing the killing of one party to avoid getting involved in the intimate affairs of the other is not a just solution 
being that a person is deserving of rights based upon their being a person that is based upon their own internal characteristics 
that is it is not reasonable to simply ignore the rights of one party 
saying that the baby would serve as an emotional reminder of what happened in the past is not the way out although i sympathise with victims of rape who have conceived babies for their attacker i say to you please keep in mind that there are happy couples out there who have tried for years to get pregnant but simply can not because on infertility so for you to have that ability to bring a precious soul into this world and give it up is saddening 
that is abortion because of medical reasons i can not say to you that the correct thing to do in a situation like that is to save the baby and leave the mother to die because the mother may have a husband who loves her and have already attached to her so in a situation like this where it is strictly for medical purposes and abortion seems to be the only way to save the motherls life then i agree that it should be allowed 
if abortion is legallised without boundaries then this will just be an easy way out for women to become sexually active even more than before and not have to worry about giving birth 
i am strongly against abortion simply because man does not give life and therfore should not take life especially a life that innocent 
in essence if a man hits a woman in the womb and kills the fetus regardless of the stage he will be tried for not one but possibly two accounts of murder depending on the mothers health 
if a defected fetus is kept and born into the world the fetus is already developed into a child who is carrying a bad pool of genes waiting to be released into our civilization which will halt the formation of a more improved human race 
they cannot have a life worth living because they are not happy or not aware of living 
i do not live in the you s i live in australia where abortion is not considered as feticide 
because giving birth would jeopardize the  years old girls life and if you still insist that she should not have an abortion anyway because you believe abortion is a crime knowing the risk then you are feigning ignorance to that girls well being 
another classic contradiction is if a fetus survives the abortion it is then considered a human life and people have to try to save its life under the born alive infants act 
the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime 
when a man is raped he may suffer mental damage 
if abortion was a crime then she would be criminalized just because she does not want to risk her life 
this is because the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime 
even a doctor someone who has to oblige laws and regulations would advise her to get an abortion 
their families also will be absolutely devastated because now that they have memories of their children it is more painful for them to die as a human being than die as a fetus 
and to the contrary i would argue men were seen as tools to a higher degree than that of women 
my opponent argued that men were seen as tools to a higher degree than that of a woman e g vast majority of death in war 
the fetus under the law in this regard is considered a living human being and is granted the protections of humans 
i agree that if a man causes grievous bodily harm to a woman example provided by my opponent as seen above he should be charged with the crime that he has made 
they are also constantly in pain due to the diseases that were already imprinted on them since they were in the womb 
negative rebuttals then two points on individual aspect of his her argument 
then she is advised by the doctor to get an abortion to avoid putting herself at risk 
ladies and gentlemen as a debater on the affirmative side i strongly believe that abortion should not be a crime 
at  years old she can not have the life experience motherhood needs nor the physical ability to carry out a difficult labor 
would you argue that an unborn fetus not yet a real human being should be kept despite that its existence will no doubt kill or greatly damage its mother a very real living human being 
round  affirmative rebuttals then two points on the individual aspect of his her argument 
the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime 
a few centuries ago and of course in some countries up to this day women were viewed only as a reproduction tool to carry out their husbands genome 
they were created to make sure our society functions orderly and to prevent as well as punish any act conducted by an individual or a group that may endanger the environment or society 
does having an abortion will create an outbreak in crime or distort the order in the society 
negative rebuttals then two points for his her argument 
abortion is not a crime it is neither harmful to society nor the environment 
round  affirmative give rebuttals to the four points that were made by the opposition 
sex is primarily for procreation and is designed to be enjoyed by a man and a woman within the confines and commitment of marriage 
a fetus is neither dead nor an insect nor a plant 
you embrace the selfish nature of people rather than encouraging individual responsibility for our actions 
 russian children killed by adoptors is certainly a tragedy but it pales in comparison to the  babies killed by abortionists each day just in the us alone according to concernedwomen org which also states abortion increases breast cancer risks other health risks and leads to serious emotional consequences 
do we step on adult spiders and cut down mature trees 
also  women have died as a result of legal abortion 
 just look at this picture of a train from japan no train expert but i have a feeling that the japanese train shown is more technologically advanced than any government controlled amtrak train 
again look at amtrak if the government is controlling the commoddity trains abortion etc then it would be in the best interest of the government to create a monopoly for itself with cumbersome regutions and licensing so that they can make more money 
according to nr in  congress passed the passenger rail investment and improvement act priia which endowed amtrak with the powers of a regulatory agency that makes decisions in conjunction with the department of transportation about scheduling uses of available tracks maintenance and other metrics and standards that compel certain behavior by the entire you s rail industry 
if government got into the abortion business it would have the power to regulate and control the abortion business enough to the extent that the government would crush all of its opposition in the free market 
sure pro did not explicitly say that the government would threaten people with fines violence imprisonment in order to make them pay for abortion clinics but i say how else would the government get people to pay for things if they refuse 
freight rail entities which actually are private understandably objected and the d c circuit agreed with them that priia was an unconstitutional delegation of governmental regulatory power to a private entity 
like i said even dollars and change can mean the world to people who live eating only one meal a day while living paycheck to paycheck and the government would literally be stealing those dollars and change from the poor in order to pay for the abortions of rich people who just did not feel like wearing a condom one day 
according to a  study published in the scandinavian journal of public health stated that abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression 
according to a  chinese study and a  study of women s with abortions on the international journal of epidemiology  both studies found a strong link between abortion and breast cancer 
a trend of which breast cancer is more common and mental health is at risk sometimes even turning suicidal  
according to maureen condic phd of neurobiology and anatomy assistant professor at the university of utah states most primitive response to pain the spinal reflex there is universal agreement that pain is detected by the fetus in the first trimester 
this brings me to my extension fetuses do feel pain during abortion 
so essentially abortions also put a permanent torn on the mother 
thus i ve proved to you in this round that a fetuses deserve a right to life b abortions can because later problems for the mother 
heres a brief outline of the debate round  acceptances and definitions round   debating rounds arguments and rebuttals round  summaries rebuttals are allowed by no new arguments are permitted some basic rules no personal attackings no use of abusive language no forfeiting getting onto some definitions abortion the elimination of a foetus during pregnancy 
i can say for all his cases let us allow an emergency abortion but that still does not meet the criterion for his b o p that is abortion 
he does not get to simply spam random words and then expect my to piece together his argument like a jigsaw 
i have written more than he has about this on this debate 
his argument is just singular words with no context 
likewise no one should say the baby should be at the mercy of the mother at least later in pregnancy 
you merely state that two seconds outside of the womb is insufficient to kill the child because it no longer is attached to the mother 
no one would say the victim in the analogy should be at the mercy of the person who caused the accident 
if a mother or parents cannot handle a child why force them to have it simply to satisfy the people who do not believe in abortion 
i do not understand why you took this debate if you do not think the mother should be able to abort a week before her due date for fleeting reasons 
she still assumed the risk of pregnancy and there is soemthing to be said about her lack of periods and keeping in tune with what is going on 
 recgonizing not all woman have periods due to birth control etc so are you suggesting a woman with no traditinoal exception like health should be able to abort her child a week before her due date just because she wants to 
you were just trying to poke holes in something 
that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not 
the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply 
if there is no significant health or life or very very significant emotional problems which might include rape but since I am focusing on later term pregnancy the mother is losing her rights in that regard given she did not abort when morally grayer aborting the infant in the womb is no different than aborting it when it is born 
as for his statement that no one gets an abortion unless they need one that is utterly wrong most people go straight to this option 
abortion something everyone says is totally right and those who oppose it are wrong but are we 
should there be an amendment to ban abortion in my opinion yes there should 
if not then one of two things is true either the victim was afraid to report it which is totally understandable or it was not actually rape 
would aborting the baby change history and totally erase the rape in every way shape and form 
the questions i posed regarding rape my opp does seem to have the initial same answer as me is it the unborn babys fault the woman got raped 
you are then forced into a lengthy and expensive court battle to try and get the child into adoption 
but even after the child is born the rapist could then step in to legally block the adoption 
what judge jury in their right mind would really let a sex offender have access to a child that they allegedly took part in creating 
finally you are forced to pay money to your rapist for the next  years all because he raped you 
would aborting the baby change history and totally erase the rape in every way shape and form 
even when i debate my liberal friends about abortion they shut off when i ask those questions i eagerly await my opps rebuttals  
in order to defend this position further my opp would have to answer the following questions  
yes there is pain involved i can attest to that more on that in a bit but not every moment is pain as i can attest why or how can i attest to this 
there is no reason why someone should abort a baby due to a deformation 
i am by all intents and purposes a productive memeber of society as are several other people with spina bifida even the ones who do not walk google gabriel gigout 
is it the unborn babys fault the woman got raped 
i will let my opponent make his arguments in the first round 
now the only way i can state that this type of murder is absolutely wrong immoral and unethical is to state that the bible claims murder should not be done 
 harm implies a certain amount of self awareness or a taking away of something one is aware they once had 
do you believe it is moral to bring a child into an environment in which they will not be stable nurtured or cared for 
 the point of my first argument is that very little harm is truly being done 
you yourself cannot give any justification of why abortion should be allowed therefore it is not right to continue abortion because it is indeed murder 
physically we are made of the same things but otherwise humans and animals are totally different 
my point in the first statement was that it does not matter in either case they are both an individual human 
this is actually quite common in the animal kingdom if a mother or father cannot properly care for their young they will kill all or the weakest of them 
abortion is legal because the government has shied away from the definition of a human life 
even if you say there is no harm done in this logic there is nothing wrong with killing a person in a coma 
how does abortion fit into the unethical side 
intent to inflict grievous bodily harm short of death iii 
if you cannot care for a child you can choose the following  not to have sex  prevent fertilization  adoption 
 this is murder by the law and abortion if the embryo is a human falls under this category 
but the choice is not instead of letting the person die we kill the person 
so any pretense that abortion is not killing is a signal of our ambivalence a signal that we cannot say yes it kills a fetus faye wattelton planned parenthoods longest reigning president 
i will be taking the position that abortion is wrong unethical immoral etc 
i am not sure what my opponent will debate here to show abortion is wrong but i am sure it will be interesting 
 i think we have deluded ourselves into believing that people do not know that abortion is killing 
definition of abortion killing a fetus aborting a pregnancy to show the gravity of the situation here are some statistics in   
not forced but just made aware that her unborn child can live its life being loved by a mother who never had the opportunity she has 
by three months the unborn child goes from being called an embryo to a fetus meaning that it now has limbs and such 
 and even if that is your true motive why should one woman get to force another woman to have a baby for her 
those children that are older have a choice already on how they choose to live and if they want to be adopted to a certain family or person where as those unborn children don t 
not require and not trying to fix only trying to save the lives of those  million aborted babies that had no say in there unlived lives 
not all women are comfortable with fertility treatments and would rather just adopt a baby they can raise as their own 
 number of married women ages   that are infertile unable to get pregnant for at least  consecutive months  
i doubt that your belief is based on the thousands of women who can not conceive 
i wasn t really going for terms but if you want to get technical the unborn child 
abortions should only be allowed before the end of the womens first trimester the first  months after the first three months the only option for the unborn child should be adoption 
why punish the baby for the mistakes of another 
the sanctity of life is the idea that god gave life to the human race especially christians and so to take away life before natural causes including disease is to be playing god which is blasphemy and condemns the perpetrator to hell 
 gods divine plan does not conform to the idea of free will  it takes away the uniqueness that god bestowed upon humanity when he created the human race  it is considered to be murder and commandment  says that 
secondly god is supposedly a power above humanity and the things he does he does for a reason 
point  links on to this really very nicely too the idea that god created us in his own image let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth 
the bible does indeed state that god has a divine plan but it also says that god gave humans free will to a great extent we can determine our future 
christians are offended by the idea that abortion is legal how humanity created by god has fallen to such a low level 
christians are opposed to abortion because of the following reasons  it breaks the sanctity of life the idea that god gave us life and so only he can take it and for a human to do that is playing god 
why would anyone create anything better than something else yet have that same thing bound by its own will which makes it the same as the things it was supposed to be different from 
abortion is appalling in this way as it refutes the idea that humanity is unique and special and that we have a right given by god to live 
as you can see god gave us free will free will to follow his commands but in the way that does not make life meaningless and controlled but rather in a way that allows us to make our own informed decisions or else jesus would not have had to pay for our sins the bible would be a useless tool as we would do whatever god wanted and thus we have free will 
murder one of the ten commandments written by god and dictated to his creation in the knowledge that believers would adhere to such things 
the free will is what makes a human a human we are not bound by mere instinct we are dynamic and capable of a higher level of thought 
even if they do go to heaven the biggest issues christians have with abortion is that it is murder and to murder is to break one of the ten commandments and as such go to hell 
secondly you said that god has never interacted with the human species himself except to speak to moses in the form of a burning bush 
as such the fact that abortion exists is because of the free will god gave humanity and not an act of god itself in the same way that fertility treatments are an extension of jesus knowledge and love abortions were the extension of free will bestowed upon humanity so that we would not be animals 
and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother 
this means that we have the ability to make our own decisions whether to abort or not for example 
for a start this is unclear as to go to heaven one needs to be christian baptised and been cleansed of sins three things that unborn babies can not do 
therefore if states do not allow for teenagers to be seen at an appointment without a parent or guardian present it is illogical for someone to allow the decision of an appointment for an abortion for a child to be there by themselves or make the decision by themselves 
i believe that teenagers are not able to process what comes emotionally and or socially after they make the decision of having unprotected sex due to various cases of pregnant teenage girls that go to the school counselor just to speak of bullying or other critics that they may receive once made that decision 
many parents would agree that a majority of teenagers are incapable to make decisions that affect another individuals life 
with a consent of a parent or consent from a guardian the child is being advice from an adult before they continue with taking someones life 
i do believe that a minor should need consent for an abortion 
some people may not understand what an abortion is until it is done 
that was my bad i had forgotten to post my initial position along with the description of the rounds 
so to choose to terminate the life a possibly viable human is wrong indeed 
therefore if the mother is conscious during the first  weeks she should be well aware of her condition and should have by this point accepted her destiny to become a mother otherwise she would have abort the child in the earlier stages 
the baby should be delivered via c section and given the medical care needed to offer the best chance for survival the quality of medical care will always very based on the current conditions and my in fact may include no care if none is available 
i am not debating validity of abortion at large but rather as it applies to this topic abortion when the health of the mother is at risk 
 if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy would exist because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy there are many cases where abortions happen after viability 
perhaps i could have made it more clear but in any case this debate is pretty much over 
it is just not true that the child can not live without the mother 
i meant this to mean it could live without the mother 
healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed 
 to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do 
abortion should not be allowed in cases where mothers life is at risk but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted 
the pro has clarified how people who are suspected of being future tyrannical leaders would be examined on an annual basis which may give his argument more believable but what if a subject is examined multiple times and only once is considered for retrospective abortion 
as for the con attacking my position over the death penalty to nullify my argument there is a very outstanding difference between retrospective abortion and the death penalty death penalty the subject has already committed a terrible crime been found guilty of committing it and the state he was prosecuted in has decided to sentence him to death 
they are being killed because of fear they will commit a crime based on their early childhood behavior and nothing else 
as much as i despise hitler for many reasons hitler only became involved in what would be the nazi party in  
 is that it would bring peace to the world the  is that it would only be used on children of extreme naughtiness 
I will stop here and elaborate further on later if i must but here are some points of why retrospective abortion should not be allowed it might not protect the world from future tyrannical people who act like normal children in their early years this process could put to death thousands of children whose lives would not have caused the misery of millions childhood behavior does not foretell how they will act in the future many of the people who are infamous in history did not develop into who they became until adulthood the age limit of such a law could allow people who do act evil to escape the system parents may try to exploit the system to have their children aborted because they could not get an abortion before 
coupled with the facts that is it from the h sapiens species and has all human dna there is no valid justification for not considering the embryo to be a human being 
my point is that even though death is natural it is not the indispensable means by which society is created nor does it have any special social value 
whether sub consciously or consciously the risk has already been taken and the blame is put on the people engaging in the act of coitus 
not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights i quote from my opponent the second part of the argument can be dismissed 
my opponent tries to dismiss my by saying that a person in a coma already already has legal rights and is not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights 
i have also left out the fact that many abortion are taxpayer funded which adds to the economic societal detriment 
kinsey showed in  that  to  of all illegal abortions were performed by licensed physicians in good standing 
also my opponent has dropped one of my most important points which is that the fetus embryo has all the human dna that will ever be developed in its lifetime 
my opponent has completely neglected the part where i previously said that by engaging in the act of coitus the participants are automatically taking up a risk 
first of all the point is not whether or not the person who shot the gun was doing it accidentally 
just because birth control fails it does not automatically give the women the right to abort 
not only does this debate have nothing to do with current legality but just because something is not binding does not make it any less valid 
i provided a source which stated otherwise but apparently my opponent automatically thinks that a book source is invalid with no justification whatsoever 
also even if the womans life is not threatened but she is somewhat temporarily disabled the killing of the baby is not justified simply because of a temporary disability 
he has introduced these so called without any proof of them even existing 
death is natural but that whole argument also hinges on pregnancy having special social value and being the precondition to society 
you have definitely not proven that the coma argument is invalid 
my opponent has failed to address perhaps the strongest point of my case the fact that an embryo has all human dna that will ever be obtained in its life 
an embryo or a fetus has all the possible dna that a human can ever obtain in its lifetime 
in circumstances in which the female is at the risk of dying or has been raped abortion is permissible 
my opponent also has not stated why the embryo or fetus does not have a right to use the pregnant womens body 
consider an alteration of this argument made by jim spiegel   
my opponent has also asked me to prove that if a embryo were a human abortion should be banned 
fetus humana human is defined as  a member of the genus homo and especially of the species h sapiensbelonging to a species is determined from the dna of an organism 
this point is again a violation of the rules and should be disregarded 
my opponent has stated that because an embryo is not conscious it should not be granted rights 
the person who randomly woke up with a violinist connected has not been previously aware of any sort of risk that this might happen 
the only time that this might not happen is in cases of rape but this has been defined as no part of this debate in round  
 violates rightagain this has all been addressed in the rules of round  
however the concept of human rights in it self requires a certain set of morals to recognize them such as not murder stealing etc 
an abortion is clearly a violation of the hippocratic oath and cannot be deemed to continue 
it is responsible for the development and growth of mankind 
if it does not have a right to do this then all pregnancies should be aborted as it is a violation of the rights of the female 
  my opponents  moralitymy opponent is stating the government should have no obligation to enforce morality to human rights 
people in a comatose are given rights are not conscious nor viable 
when somebody chooses to be subjected to a risk and the risk happens the blame should only be on themselves not the innocent human being inside of them 
this is according to the one of the only embryology textbooks used in medical schools langman s medical embryology written by thomas w sadler phd  continuing on with the point that a fetus is a human we have to realize that not only is the fetus being created by the human s natural processes it is a unique human individual just as each of us is 
i will choose to focus on a fetus not a zygote or an embryo because most abortions happen during the fetal period 
 fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm spermatozoon with a secondary oocyte ovum and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell 
one very important point is that the entire biological and scientific communities agree on one common definition for human life one human individual s life begins at the completion of the union of his father s sperm and his mother s ovum a process called or 
that is the amount of money that the state could have gained by not performing abortions 
multiply the number of abortion    by   the average salary per year and then multiply it by  the average life expectancy 
a fetus is simply the combination of the male sperm and the women s ovum 
this fertilized ovum known as a zygote is a large diploid cell that is the beginning or primordium of a human being 
combining the two creates an entirely unique organism not alike to its mother or father 
to summarize the first contention i have concluded that a fetus is a living being is a unique human individual and is simply a stage of development in the human process 
since the legalization of roe v wade in the united states there have been about  million abortion 
resolved the practice of abortion ought to be made illegalabortion the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy 
people make choices all the time so this should not be surprising to anyone that sometimes a person may change their mind on the idea on abortion 
i will instead use this time to elaborate on the claim and hope my opponent engages me 
if an abortion does not work then the person in question has the choice to attempt the abortion again which happens in many cases 
i am sure my opponent and i can agree on the term abortion as given below 
abortion a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy and because the death of the fetus 
so botched abortion is a fallacy as it does not mean the baby was born during the abortion 
if you cannot handle a baby because you are not able too than think of the baby instead of yourself 
i stand resolve that instead of abortion that we need to think of adoption so that a baby can have a mom and dad 
people tend to forget that what if our parents believed in killing us instead of keeping us or at least putting us up for adoption 
just as the liberal creed goes a human life by how far along down the road of life he is on and we should not judge a human by whether he is conscious or not 
let me propose my pro life argument in the form of a question if you pro abortionists could be convinced beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever that an embryo was a human life would you recant your abortion stance 
using this argument is it ethical to kill a newborn solely based on the fact that it is not by our standards 
there is a dichotomy in this debate and if you are you essentially condone the act of abortion since you do not condemn it 
how then do you justify killing something that has no awareness of itself on the sole basis that it does not have awareness of itself 
my opponent utterly fails to prove why we should make such a drastic claim to the status quo and then demonizes me for opposing his opinions therefore i urge you all  in this debate simply because my opponent gives you no reason to vote for them 
so no i have warranted my opponent needing to win all six points in my prior speech which my opponent never touches on and i have further clarified it here 
now as for the con side my opponent does not touch the three points i offer so they also go to the con 
but what they do not understand is it is these restrictions that make such atrocities not happen in the first place 
closing arguments so with that let us look to the pro side of the debate pro first on the framework my opponent accepts the burden of proof but claims that it is abusive to say they must win all six of their points to win this debate 
second my opponent never warrants that it is just a so this argument is two fold not applicable 
my character limit makes it impossible for me to not only copy paste my prior arguments and expand on them but it would also be irrelevant since is the last round and my opponent could not argue it back 
now for my closing statements my opponent advocates that this debate is strictly that concerning but it goes far beyond that 
his refutation also has not evidence to support his claim 
physical damage to the mother argument summary it is too early in the debate for me to summarize just yet especially since my opponent has not had an opportunity to respond to my constructive arguments 
the bulk of their content is in my attacks on the pro case as it is already and the topic does not give me a burden to provide an alternative but simply to disprove the pro 
now for maximum clarity i will frame the round a bit then i will be going pro then con and finishing up with an argument summary frame i simply want to point out here that the burden of proof is on the pro as they are advocating a change to the current state of events 
pregnancy is an emotionally and physically stressful time for women and they deserve to know about the procedure before under going it 
again pregnancy is a stressful time for women they deserve time to think on such a huge decision i also want to extend my arguments on point  here 
meaning they must over overwhelmingly win the clash first off and also win all six points they presented in their constructive 
con for now i will just present the tags and expand on them as later 
if pro disagrees they may say so in their next speech and this point will be abolished 
here is a vast amount of support in the united states for a ban on partial birth abortion 
i know there is a lot of people out there who disagree with this so the invitation for this debate will be open to anyone 
i do not think it matters the timeline of proof i have shown 
I am just trying to say there is a way a father male were to have a right to choose just as much as the mother female could 
this was a fun debate i appreciate it and thank my opponent 
unborn are humani have given a valid definition from an embryology book that attests to the fact that the zygote developmental stage is factually when a new human organism comes into being 
i previously established that the unborn are humans and since humans have a rational nature humans are persons at every stages of life 
since pro had no countering studies to the effect his only response was that the study was of a small sample size 
defence of argumentpro has claimed that i have taken the pro life side and that is true but not exclusively so 
it is merely an appeal to emotions and as such this argument has been disproven 
once again this is contradictory to the premise of fundamental human rights and equality of people 
since pro has failed to discredit the fact that the unborn are individual distinct human beings and did not disagree with the concept of fundamental human rights my argument stands in its entirety 
the pro life refutation of this argument would counter that personhood is best described by the philosopher boethius a person is an individual substance that has a rational nature 
additionally rationality and thus sentience is not something that is added to a human by the mother or some other agent but is rather an inherent attribute of humans that expresses itself to a greater degree over time 
instead of refuting this claim with any scientific claim or knowledge to the contrary pro attempts to refute scientific fact with an imaginary blending of colours that represents the developmental stages of the unborn child 
conclusioni have defended my original arguments and clearly shown why each of pros arguments fails to substantiate his argument 
that is like arguing that because the plantation owner may have his finances adversely affected that he has a right to enslave some blacks 
furthermore i have shown why pro arguing that the development of sentience is the dividing line between permissibility and impermissibility of abortion has actually caused him to lose the entire debate 
argument  bad future for mother and child when rape involvedhere i went really soft on pro 
thus by making the sentience argument pro has lost the debate because by using sentience as the dividing line one is forced to take the arguments to their conclusions 
one could argue that you should be able to have your kidney forcibly taken from you to help another person who is dying because this other persons interaction and interactions from his relieved family members will be a net positive to society 
the study actually stated that women who abort actually suffer more than those who do not because it is likely that the victim already harbors feelings of guilt as a result of the assault medico social pressures which encourage and result in abortion could compound the woman s feelings of guilt and self blame perhaps as a result of their own biases and an unwillingness to deal with the more emotionally difficult complications of a pregnant rape victim many physicians suggest abortion in this case as one would prescribe aspirin for tension headache while on the surface this suggestion may appear acceptable and even humane to many the victim is dealt another disservice 
thus the parents and particularly the mother are viewed as owning the child instead of being the natural guardian s of the child 
often the offer of such quick and easy solutions as abortion only serve those who are uncomfortable or unwilling to deal with the special problems and needs that such complications as pregnancy might present 
 from this stage onward a new human organism exists one which we all had to pass through to arrive at our current level of development 
this moral equality is the this was most famously penned in the us declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
what we are debating is the whether or not a human being has a right to its own life dependent on the circumstances either she or her mother will face now or in the future 
one cannot pursue happiness if one does not have a right to liberty and one cannot have liberty if one does not have a right to life 
i posit that we live in a world that has come to realize the inherent and inalienable rights of humanity 
now while it is true that our societal interactions can be positive for society this belief would make it justifiable to kill hermits or the homeless who choose not to interact with others 
the child will grow up with unloving parents if there are indeed  parents 
the unborn being afforded no such interaction with the world are thus easy to dehumanize into objects with scientific terms like fetus and embryo 
once she is on the operating table she loses control over her body 
and it is this right to life that is being dismissed if people accept that there are times in which abortion should be allowed 
giving birth especially when conception was not desired is a totally selfless act a generous act a display of courage strength and honor 
abortion an operation or other procedure including ingestion of abortifacient pills such as ru  conducted with the primary intention being the death of the zygote embryo or fetus 
as per the rules i will make one clarification of position here in the form of a definition of abortion 
this concludes the my opening round and i pass the debate back to pro to provide the opening arguments 
human and not jewishhuman and conscioussee how good we are at creating reasons that permit us to enslave dominate and kill some particular group by not recognizing the obvious fact that they are as equally human as the rest of us 
 in fact pro goes on to state that mowing the grass is morally equivalent or perhaps worse than killing a human zygote the most elementary stage of human life 
I have shown that his arguments are based on appeals to emotion and a denial of rights through discrimination based on size and development of the unborn 
this is not something that happens by accident or randomly but rather is the normative developmental trajectory of humans 
sometimes right sometimes wrongpro questions why i bothered to fully refute his argument stating i refuted it because it was faulty logic and he has to show that there are both times that it is and is not permissible 
conclusionpro has failed to substantiate either side of his argument 
so the argument is that if you have had a bad accident or will suffer a brain aneurysm in the next  hours we can just rescind your rights and kill you on the spot 
that is because he introduced almost no new arguments but instead tried to give analogies that showed that the unborn were not humans before a certain age 
i had noted in the previous round that rationality is something that develops from within the organism and not something that is implanted by the mother or some other agent 
this is because we have a rational nature unlike trees do not have rational natures because trees do not naturally express rationality my apologies to any ents reading this discussion 
i believe that i can confidently state that we humans are rational creatures 
if you live to a  are president and have grand kids do you have any greater right to life that the child that may only live an hour outside of its mothers womb 
we do not have a right to a particular outcome but what we do have as human beings are fundamental human rights 
is life itself and its meaning a mystery that each of us get for our time we are alive whether long and glorious or short and feeble 
additionally i gave sound reasoning as to why humans have a rational nature thus showing them to be persons right from fertilization 
rebuttalsi must admit that pro is mostly correct when he said that the majority of my rebuttals from the last round were refuting points he had made in the first round 
as such this argument has been completely substantiated and shows that every human has inalienable rights 
they had no say in these circumstances and were instead simply given life 
its not a gerbil and we can recognize that it is human life 
development is false also as a  year old woman is more developed than a pre pubescent and yet they are both human environment does not change anything as going  inches down the birth canal does not make you more or less human where you are does not dictate your humanity 
  finally this new human being the single cell human zygote is biologically an individual a living organism an individual member of the human species what makes the fetus so obviously biologically human is that from conception the fetus has human dna and the zygote is what every cell you are made from develops 
so any pretense that abortion is not killing is a signal of our ambivalence a signal that we cannot say yes it kills a fetus 
according to scientific planned parenthood argued as far back as  that everyone already knows that abortion kills 
 the official senate report reached this conclusion physicians biologists and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being a being that is alive and is a member of the human species 
 the fusion of the sperm with  chromosomes and the oocyte with  chromosomes at fertilization results in a live human being a single cell human zygote with   the number of chromosomes characteristic of an individual member of the human species 
killing robs a being of a natural property which is of great if not the greatest value 
 on the other side of the pond ann furedi the chief executive of the largest independent abortion provider in the uk said this in a  debate we can accept that the embryo is a living thing in the fact that it has a beating heart that it has its own genetic system within it 
round  acceptance round  openings round  refutations round  conclusion abortion the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy most often performed during the first  weeks of pregnancy 
in order to justify killing innocents con attempts to bring up that people should be able to choose what is moral for them and bodily autonomy however killing a human deprives them of the choice to be happy flo and violates the bodily autonomy of the fetus 
introduction refutations tbrs main argument goes as such  the government should not try to impose morality onto people but should instead let them decide  banning abortion imposes morality onto women 
allowing a person to make a choice in keeping with her moral and not subjected by anothers is socials balanced morals 
 this logic is false because the governments job is to find the best system of morality and use it in laws 
allowing a woman to make a choice in keeping with her moral and not subjected by anothers is socials balanced morals 
this argument turns to pro because the fetus is the one with bodily autonomy being violated 
by tbrs logic we should have a system of popular sovereignty in which we can choose to own slaves 
she has no legitimate claims to abort the baby if it can just be removed given her hindrance is not really an issue 
in any case ask anyone if they would rather be born into rough conditions or die and you see it is clear we should give preference to letting it live 
you seem to think the birth canal is the magical point but it is a lot more arbitrary because for effective purposes the baby can survive and all you are providing is trivial location points 
healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed 
 to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do 
in cases where mothers life is at risk but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted 
i likewise thank you for your time and for a terrific debate 
thirdly i want to bring this into the arguments because this is personal to me 
i thank you for the debate and apologize in advance if i was rude or harsh in any way to you in round i 
my cousin matthew alex has many disabilities it is hard for him to walk speak and eat among other things 
secondly a poll commissioned in  for the telegraph showed that  of members interviewed were in favour of the limit being reduced to  weeks from  week pdfs  march sunday telegraph abortion survey 
until we take a stand and let the government know we are serious about our morality ethics and values there will be no end to the debate 
we were told something would get done about abortion and we got the partial birth abortion bill which actually did next to nothing for the pro life because 
we were told something would get done about our current over taxation only duct tape and bubble gum were applied 
if you concede that a child gains the right to life at a certain point in the womb then the government has an obligation to regulate abortions even if it is only to make the determination that in a life threatening situation the most viable life must be saved 
at this point this is your position a very small number of abortions occur after the   weeks so the government has the obligation to regulate abortions 
at the point where i rob a bank my right to be involved in my decisions that affect my life and future ends 
the amount of doctors willing to perform legal abortions is shrinking so much that there has been a  decrease in abortion training in hospitals over the last  years 
a baby is the only form of innocence that humanity ever knows impeding upon the babys right to life for the sake of what is best for the woman is the ultimate act of selfishness 
according to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women discrimination against women includes laws that have either the effect or the purpose of preventing a woman from exercising any of her human rights or fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men 
it seems to me that the woman actually has more political fredom and responsibility 
 this is actually the weakest point of your argument 
if you take into consideration that a woman would have to a break the law 
one part is all i needed to address you defeated your own position 
i can decide that the best thing for my future is to have a lot of money 
the biologist will tell you that a frog is a frog from the instant it first functions as an independent organism regardless of the form it takes during the course of its development 
it would be like declaring the benchmark of life for the butterfly organism is the presence of wings and antennae and then after examining the caterpillar pronouncing that because it has neither wings nor antennae it is neither living nor a butterfly despite the fact that it is a living organism with the genome of the butterfly and if it is not killed before it completes its metamorphosis will become nothing other than a butterfly 
an organism is never identified purely on the basis of its morphological or physiological state at any given point in its lifecycle 
human being my opponent has consented in his last speech that if i prove a fetus to be a human being then my claims are legitimate 
the biologist will not hesitate to affirm that the tadpole is indeed a frog 
well it depends upon how you define the frog organism 
may we identify an organism as a frog purely on the basis of its morphology physical form 
no it would not be considered murder if he she it had no rights 
if you abort a baby in the late stages of pregnancy you are killing it 
not only but since you are the instigator in this debate then it could said that you have an even heavier burden 
it had a beating heart functioning brain skeletal respiratory digestive and other bodily systems 
obviously in this scenario the fetus posses the right to life for which the criminal will be punished for having infringed upon that right 
the burden is on you to prove that abortion is correct in every situation 
if you kill a pregnant woman you are charged with two murders 
the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy done in the late stages of pregnancy 
moral of pertaining to or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong ethical moral attitudes 
as my opponent is affirmative the burden of proof lies on him her 
okay this has to be at least one hundred characters so i am just going to ramble so she can have a chance to respond 
as far as abortion goes i think we stand on the same platform as far as the execution of the act goes only the law remains in speculation 
if we fail to execute murderers and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims 
and i agree there is always much more than a check in a box to describe your beliefs 
do not confuse in believing the death penalty for every crime with that of when it is necessary 
the average inmate on death row has an  grade education  have been convicted of prior homicide and  prior felonies 
finally if a murderer is kept in a medium security prison it would be easily achievable for them to kill another inmate 
sometimes it is a harsh reality but killing is necessary 
it is a terrible thing to say but is the driving force of civilization since the dawn of society 
the average death row inmate is held in a medium security prison 
we are talking about guilty criminals being convicted by a jury of their peers who find them too dangerous and unfit for life 
 again every rogue who severely attacks social rights becomes by his wrong a rebel and a traitor to his homeland 
i assume you will bring up the matter of when life begins 
the death penalty is applied to guilty criminals whereas abortion deals with an innocent life 
my definition is that when the potential for life begins developing i e conception life is set forth 
partial birth abortion is murder even on the pro choice understanding of personhood 
the baby has his or her body torn to pieces in most abortion methods and that can because pain to mother and child 
if a woman does not want a baby there are many contraceptive methods out there 
a lot of the abortion methods are harmful to the mother and baby 
i affirm the right of the woman to use contraception 
if she does not want a baby she needs to use contraception 
my debate partner is accusing me of forcing my beliefs on others 
if a woman does not want a baby she needs to close her legs or use birth control 
it is truely an orwellian society when unborn babies are killed because the mother is too selfish to use birth control 
the baby is a genetically different person with rights 
let the record show that my opponant is using the bandwagon fallacy again 
most abortions saying that something is true because the majority believes it is the bandwagon fallacy 
if the mother is under  and raped we should not allow the baby to die for it 
if the baby is healthy there is no reason the baby would have to die in this situation 
i would not squabble too much and understand though if you simply disagreed and it was on the specific point of allowing abortion for those underage and raped even later in pregnancy 
healthy babies are too often aborted in the name of saving the mother or trivial reasons when labor could be induced or teh baby somehow otherwise simply removed instead of abortion the mother should not have the option to abort a healthy baby when it can jsut be removed 
 to be sure this includes much abuse for mental health etc if even a healthy baby must be aborted to save the mother msot including me would agree it is the right thing to do 
in cases where mother wants abortion or to be free from the baby but the healthy baby can be safely removed instead of aborted 
on a side point given con has the highest elo on this site I am honored that con has chosen to debate this 
that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not 
the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply 
but there and earlier an argument could be made that earlier in the pregnancy she forfeits her right to not be pregnant by assuming that risk 
like say that fetus you aborted was the doctor that could cure cancer or ends proverty in  world countries abortion occurs in naturehumans will spend will tons of money to have surgery to kill the fetus and get it removed 
 fetuses cannot feel and do not have a sense of mortal danger 
you are pregnet for  months 
provided that semantics are common on this site i will provide a list of rules to prevent anyone from twisting this debate to their advantage 
it is implied that women who get abortions during their first trimester or use birth control to prevent pregnancy are not selfish 
pro nor con may not change or attempt to change this resolution 
this is the definition of selfish that me and my opponent will use for this debate 
 with the exception of rule  
the only scenario where grammar or puncuation is used as a voting factor is if the arguement is so illegible that the voter has a hard time following 
if a woman does not realize she is pregnant until the second trimester than she should woman up and have the baby like a non egotistical sociopath killer of a mother 
i can make an argument that you broke all of them and that is all i need to win this debate anyways 
voters please look at his sources and tell me if they are credible in any way shape or form 
both of these sources are sketchy as hell and they are both fvcking blog posts written by people who have no evidence of any kind to back up their bullshlt opinions 
on top of this you made three errors just in your last statement 
but seriously kid are you in fvcking elementary school 
you might want to look more closely at my arguments before the next round 
 many women could be in higher education or are really working hard for a promotion 
second of all this argument has nothing to do with abortions past the first trimester 
however even if this is not the case if the woman does not tell her partner about her pregnancy as soon as possible she is selfish 
it is important to consider this especially since grammar is an important indicator of who wins debates on most websites including this one 
now that that is out of the way the reason i think rich or middle class women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish is self explanatory 
this is not the case for rich or middle class women who almost always have the ability to get the procedure done by the end of the first trimester 
this is certainly the case for women who get abortions past their first trimester because by doing this they show a blatant disregard for the well being of the unborn baby they have in their womb 
 i assume that pro wishes to converge on the question because pro anticipates this would demonstrate that if life is said to exist then objectively it cannot be taken away 
 by this argument women must either practice celibacy the only  guaranteed form of contraception well almost if you count the immaculate conception or else risk being the hostages of their reproductive biology up until to the age of final fertility 
what the pro finds evil is the execution of the most innocent part of our society for no reason besides the burden they pose 
the pro does not want to dive into the benefits of federalism but the main point is that it allows for more direct representation of us citizen s wishes 
would this then extend to and cover all forms of human intervention that assists or ends life e g should we take polio vaccines 
the con uses faulty logic here and is also assuming what the pro believes with no evidence 
the pro also argues that individual men and women have the right to defend their body however they wish as long as it does not encroach on other individual s civil liberties 
the pro believes that the unnecessary loss of any human life is a moral evil and a terrible sadness 
the pro believes that any execution should never be committed unless there is an existing threat from a guilty individual to another human 
this displays that pros side subjectively believes there exist scenarios in which the ending of life by human intervention is sometimes a justifiable action 
if the human race does not plant the flag of human value at the conception of life there is no defense against the murder of any individual 
the sad and heart breaking act of ending a human life should only be performed when the human being can no longer return to life while not on life support 
as to the arguments of human intervention maintaining lives the pro believes that all options should be exhausted for as long as possible to save the endangered life 
the pros position is that the abortion of fetuses which do not endanger the mother are immoral and should be outlawed by proper legislation 
this belief is based on the idea that there is a set of natural processes which eventually leads to a human being outside of the womb 
this is dangerous because it deters basic human worth which can lead to the murder of millions of people 
now to begin the case for why abortion should be outlawed if the life of the mother is not endangered by the fetus 
the pro would also like to ask the con if the con believes that abortion is a terrible act no matter the justification for it 
or do you agree she should have that right and if so how do you make a meaningful distinction especially given the anaology and simple logic that the baby is still a baby regardless of if it is in the womb or outside the womb 
you have not conceded that a woman should be able to abort a week before her due date just because she wants to and not for a commonly thought of exception 
also you did not respond to the analogy which is also based on reason 
plus according to your logic if they have equal rights that does not mean the woman can kill it given the consideration mentioned 
con asks me to explain the basis for the infants rights 
my only contention is that sometimes the woman should not be able to abort 
and the assumption of risk point which you have not addressed also gives basis for infant rights 
and you did not address the hypothetical of an accident being caused by someone where the other is attached to you and you can not separate the people for a few months 
con would make it an issue of semantics an say everyone has equal rights 
no one would say it is okay for the person who caused the accident to kill the victim 
so it is okay to terminate a week before her due date just because she wants to and not for exceptions like health of the mother 
are societys rights prioritized when they say a smoker can not smoke in public places 
that analogy could be extended to later in pregnancy and then topped off with the fact that she did not bother to terminate when it was more debatable whether it is a person or not 
the only difference that the mother is hindered is trumped by the risks she assumed and that leaves nothing to justify abortion later in the pregnancy if an exception does not apply 
a reasonable person would say the tortfeasor must at least wait a few months until they can be separated 
well the debate has ended with no effort to argue in favour of abortion by pro 
my opponent has forfeited which is a shame because i was looking forward to having a good debate on this 
please state your opening argument 
i ask my opponent to not refute my rebuttal as since there will be only one round for rebuttals i cannot make a counter rebuttal 
the term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy 
violations of these rules may result in the loss of conduct points 
feeling a bit better now i suggest we restart this debate next week as i have to deal with some other personal things to deal with before i can continue this debate 
i have gotten quite sick and i have do not have the physical nor mental strength to post anything debate worthy 
same thing goes if the father wants an abortion but the mother does not 
you want to keep the child but your girlfriend wants an abortion 
the father has no rights until the second his child is born 
in many countries if a woman wants an abortion there will be an abortion even if the father wants to keep the child 
a fetus having rights is a door for men having rights over abortions 
if we define bodily autonomy as the liberty to control ones body then clearly we recognise that this is a right 
for example bringing up a toddler can because stress anxiety and other health issues yet it does not follow that the mother is justified in killing her toddler in order to improve her health 
clearly in the latter scenario someone has the liberty to withhold the use of their organs and hence the government ought to not enforce it even in cases where it would be life saving 
from this graph you can observe that the safety of abortions was increasing due to better medical technology with legalisation having little effect 
women are not forced to have an illegal abortion if they are those who are forcing them ought to be arrested and hence they accept the risks of abortion by choosing to have one 
but the other health risks of pregnancy do not justify abortion either since we are not justified in killing others in order to improve our health 
the fallacy within the bodily autonomy argument is that it wrongly presumes that pro lifers appeal to the foetuss right to be sustained by the mother whereas in reality we appeal to the foetuss right not to be killed 
this is essentially j s mills harm principle the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community against his will is to prevent harm to others 
furthermore con makes the false assumption that having an abortion in these cases would increase the welfare of the woman 
therefore abortion is not justified in cases of rape because there is no reason to suppose that it actually helps the rape victim and it even suggests that it negatively affects them 
for example this criterion would mean that comatose unconscious people have no liberty including the freedom not to be killed 
however it is not demonstrated that one can only have liberty if they value it 
for example i have the bodily autonomy to control my fists but not to the extent where i can punch someone since this causes harm 
in a stable civilised society the mother has obligations to ensure the welfare of her offspring whereas she may not have these obligations to those who are not her offspring 
since abortion is the direct killing of the foetus this infringes upon this latter right not the former because the former is not a genuine right 
therefore one does not have to value their liberty in order to have liberty therefore a foetus can still qualify as a being that has human liberties 
 both of cons attempts to remove a foetuss liberty are invalid and hence the foetus retains basic liberties namely the liberty not to be killed 
women have the moral obligation to carry an unborn child women are morally obligated to provide for a child during pregnancy for the following reasons absolute dependency one of these reasons is that the child has absolute dependency on the mother 
since it is the duty of the government to create laws that protect our unalienable rights and it is the moral obligation of human beings as a whole to protect unalienable rights i declare that abortion should therefore be illegal 
the government fails in it is duty to respect the most important of unalienable rights and since the government s duty is to uphold these rights the government should therefore make abortion illegal 
that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness 
now most of my opponent s arguments rested on the fallacy that unalienable rights are subjective and that since we as a people have no right 
  we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
in both cases the person who desires to take the life of another is denied because they conflict with our unalienable rights 
it has already been shown that life begins at conception and seeing that true the right to life has been granted to the unborn child 
 to force laws among other people then women still retain the freedom to have an abortion whether that choice is moral or immoral 
conclusion to take the child s life is to value the ease of your own life over the unalienable rights of the unborn child 
women have the moral obligation to provide for an unborn child this section will finally focus on how humans have a moral obligation to provide for those who have absolute dependency on you in order to fully respect our human dignity and the right to life 
in response to me arguing that innocent human life is not to be terminated do to respect for human dignity and the right to life my opponent responds you may have a moral rules laws and maybe abortion is out of moral but you can not require or force somebody to live according to the rules set by society if it contradicts the liberty of person you have no choice 
in response to me stressing the importance to the right to life my opponent says if your laws are wrong then it is time to change your law 
the reason unalienable rights exist is because we need an objective foundation from which all rights may transcend in order to make the most efficient and morally sound society as possible 
in response to my argument on the importance of the right to life my opponent says you have a right to leave baby has a right to live on but the woman has also right not to destroy her life so that the baby can live on i do not understand what my opponent is saying due to atrocious grammatical mistakes 
my opponent finishes his arguments by providing stories that are supposed to be comparable to abortion but instead brings stories that are flawed due to the human not having absolute dependency on the provider 
my opponent is in essence arguing that we cannot force anyone to go against their own personal liberty therefore the individual should have the right to do anything even if it means the termination of another s life 
my opponent s arguments are also flawed because under his logic a parent can simply stop providing for a very young child that can not take care of itself because we apparently have the right to stop providing others 
the unborn child has complete dependency on the mother therefore meaning that the woman has the moral obligation to carry this child and then when possible may either choose to continue caring for the child or give it up for adoption 
the thing is the stories are extremely flawed and cannot be compared to abortion at all 
we are not something different than what we were at conception but instead we are the same being at a different stage of development much like how a child is still of the same biological material an adult is but is not at the same stage of growth 
 as explained in my introduction through human dignity and our unalienable rights we are afforded the right to life not only by society but by humanity as a whole 
conclusion every abortion takes the life of an unborn member of the human race violating the unalienable right to life of that human and eroding the human dignity of that child 
seeing this as true if there is a morally justifiable reason that i be killed there must also be a morally justifiable reason for killing an unborn child but because that child has done no evil it is life should not be terminated 
as americans we have established that the right to life is an unalienable right and is to never be taken away unless the rights of the individual is taken away due to actions they have committed against the society 
 from the moment of conception to our death we are all full fledged members of humanity 
introduction i will be arguing that the woman should not have the choice to abort a child due our unalienable right to life and the very basics of our human dignity 
I am going to be talking about the very controversial topic on a mans right in the say to a abortion I will have reasons like how no one should have their child stolen away when you did nothing wrong women should have to keep the kid but are allowed to opt of of being a parent and men and women should have the same rights as a parent 
your all excited telling your friends family and in the highlight of it all your baby is gone you are told you are not having the baby you have no choice in the matter you are just denied the your right to have a child 
i want you to take a second and imagine you are an adult and you got the great news that you are having a baby 
the child should not be held responsible for the rapists actions it is not their fault that they were made 
the mother can always give the baby to another family member to take care of or put it in an orphanage 
its the mothers life that will be affected as well if an unwanted child is born in many cases the woman is not in a position to care for a child either due to financial reasons or personal reasons like the terrifying prospect of raising a child alone 
i do not think abortion should be allowed in america because it is not the mothers life 
i understand that it does not have a heart yet or fundamental organs but it is still a living breathing creature that is being murdered because of the mother 
the act considers an unborn baby to be a human being and imposes penalties on those who inflict harm on a fetus otherwise than through an abortion 
with contraception being so effective unwanted pregnancies are typically a result of irresponsible sexual behavior 
that is my religious belief and it may not be yours which is wonderful that there is diversity 
I am sure that people who were not concieved as a result of rape have also commited suicide which flaws this argument 
you say that the woman actually does have every right and while this is a pretty bold statement you provide absolutely no evidence to why this is and you cite no sources why she should be able to 
however if that was the case i would definitely raise the child as my own because taking responsibility is what separates the weak from the strong and i choose to take care of one of gods miracles rather than killing it 
to counter your first contention I am sure that if you asked the whether or not it would rather live with that or lived at all it would have chosen the first option of living 
as a side note you failed to counter any of my arguments that i made and because you have the burden of proof i have won the first round 
while your second point makes little sense what i think that it says is about how the mother feels after 
it took me another nine years to be a part of the silent no more program 
a fetus is a human being and thus being so has the basic rights to life 
i have been more attentive towards things much more important than this debate as of late and i think that I am going to have to concede 
so unless the womans right to not be pregnant makes it permissible to kill the fetus then we have no reason to accept this 
after all i do not see how it would be acceptable to kill a born person who suffers from the same thing as the fetus in your example simply because they are a burden on society 
my second objection briefly is that you are not responsible for the violinist you are attached to 
he says that when a woman is forced to give birth the she loses utility but does not actually touch on how the mother losing utility because of her actions means she can abort to alleviate herself of her responsibility 
after all an abortion is not successful unless it results in the death of the fetus so from all of this we can conclude that abortion is intrinsically geared towards ending the fetus life in order to end the pregnancy 
 yes the main goal of an abortion is ultimately to end the pregnancy but the fetus death is the only way to do this 
however for the sake of colloquial leniency i am just going to assume that my opponent means that a woman should be allowed to control who uses her body to survive how long someone uses her body to survive and when someone uses her body to survive 
in abortion the act in and of itself is meant to kill the fetus so that the pregnancy ends 
i do not see how the are analogous so that abortion could be seen as acceptable 
as for cases of rape the violinist example is a better defense of abortion in this case because two people did not engage in voluntary sexual intercourse and would therefore not be jointly responsible for the fetus or violinist they are attached to 
while i doubt whether or not this example is realistic i think that it would not be so common and this would be one of the times where abortion may be acceptable 
if this is taken in the most literal sense then my opponent is flat out wrong 
in abortion the goal is to end the pregnancy by killing the fetus 
if my opponent agrees that some restrictions should be set forth then we can reject this claim 
therefore I will be doing the same thing as my opponent just arguing in a semi formal prose manner 
i do not anticipate that i will be forfeiting this one so i think the debate will be uninterrupted 
if a bundle of flesh can make no rational choices then it the duty of the mother universally agreed upon governing body to make that decision for it 
definitions abortion a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy and because the death of the fetus 
debate rules  pro will write his case in round  
 pro will abstain from posting any arguments or rebuttals in round  in order to ensure an equal number of rounds for both sides to debate 
if they choose to stay in school they get even more support in order to that 
i agree that if the pregnancy is dangerous for either mother or child there should be no question as to whether or not she could have an abortion 
they get more support if they move out of their parents house and live on their own 
should that be a choice for anyone 
in this debate i am against abortion and you are for 
well like my previous statement 
i say no it should not be legal i only see it able to be legal is if it is rape other then that it was their choice to have sex and they know the consequences of that action s 
this is important because i want to have my viewpoint challenged the reason i think rich or middle class women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish is self explanatory 
this is not the case for rich or middle class women who almost always have the ability to get the procedure done by the end of the first trimester 
the reason that poor women who get abortions past their first trimester are not selfish is because they may not have the resources to get one before the second or hopefully not the third trimester 
 provided that semantics are common on this site i will provide a list of rules to prevent anyone from twisting this debate to their advantage 
it is implied that women who get abortions during their first trimester or use birth control to prevent pregnancy are not selfish 
sorry i could not put spaces in between certain words in my resolution 
i meant to put on my other debate too but i did not because there was not enough space to do so 
i actually got to know the user better and it turns out he she is not that bad of a guy girl 
also if con had actually read my argument instead of skimming it they would see that the beginning of my argument was addressing this i will now point out that con has contradicted him herself 
 it is funny that you even made this into a contention oh what ever shall i do i misspelled the word 
do really i need to mention that you have not used any sources of any kind whatsoever in your past two pathetic excuses for rebuttals 
however we are not discussing the moral implications of abortion just the selfish aspect 
con is saying that it is nonsense to bring a child into the world if they are unloved 
most rich middle class women who get abortions are doing so cheifly for their own benifit most of the time at the overall expense of the child 
this is the definition of selfish that is used in this debate s own personal profit or pleasure 
i know that if those mothers can give their babies in adoption instead of killing them because they will find someone that adopts them and loves them 
i would like to point out this part of cons statement specifically one of the worst thing that could happen to someone is having parents who do not love him 
  lastly i want to emphasise the generalising nature of the resolution 
con states that one of the worst thing that could happen to someone is having parents who do not love him 
middle class and rich women by definition have more than enough money to go to other countries to get the procedure done quickly if need be 
granted getting an abortion may be difficult for poor women who may or may not have the resources to do so but they are not included in my resolution 
everyone has a place in this world 
there is no guarantee that it is the best decision for both parties and how could it be that way if one of the parties dies non consensually 
if abortion was illegal the choice would be much simpler and the abortion rate would decrease which is what both the left and the right want to accomplish 
a fetus should be a child when they have all the necessary chromosomes to be so 
even though sex feels good it does not justify killing the unborn child that comes as a result of it 
read argument  and the reasons that i believe i should add here 
if they are not ready for a child then they do not have sex 
consider if you have agreed to donate your kidney to a possible recipient then there is no justification to willingly unplug and kill that recipient 
viability is often used by pro choice advocates but this is a largely meaningless term that I would be happy to address in the next round if pro wishes 
old child an interesting moral dilemma but i can play that game all day what if one room contained  strangers and the other contained your sister 
i will do so on the basis of logic science and legal consistency under the assumption that human life deserves to be protected 
the  unborn victims of violence act uvva section  says that any action that injures a child in utero can be punished as if the injury was inflicted on the mother herself even if the offender acted accidentally or had no knowledge she was pregnant 
this is a very difficult question to answer since there is no clear answer to be found 
incredibly this means that if a pregnant woman on her way to the abortion clinic gets hit by a texting driver survives but loses the baby then that driver can be charged with manslaughter 
since pro claimed that an embryo even if we are meets zero criteria this argument is now at least in doubt if not refuted 
sure you could say indirectly maybe but that standard could be applied to all of us i could be indirectly killing a coal miner in peru since my choice to flip a light switch on is driving the demand for a dangerous energy source 
not only do embryos meet some of these criteria but this definition fails when applied to other groups of people and should be rejected 
the problem is there is evidence that at just  weeks an embryo can hiccup and react to loud noises 
the combination of  chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in  chromosomes in the zygote 
yet if the woman arrives safely at the abortion clinic she can her baby in a perfectly legal and often celebrated procedure 
to take it further let us apply these criteria to other people a brain dead person lacks   an unconscious person lacks   a severely mentally handicapped person lacks   on and on 
if we once again relate this to our consenting organ donor then it appears pros analogy has little relevance 
this is largely an irrelevant point since abortion is currently legal and it has nothing to say about why abortion should remain legal other than pro thinks it seems 
there is not a single scientific argument to justify why a fetus is not a member of the human species 
i am advocating a right to life specifically for unborn embryonic humans and i have no requirement to extend that out to drone strikes war dropping the a bomb 
pro assumes that i would save the  year old because i would instinctively identify the  year old as a person and the embryos as non persons 
the problem is i never used a fundamental right to life argument so I am not sure why pro is attacking this 
i have already demonstrated why these  criteria do not survive scrutiny which forces us to embrace a definition more in line with the uvaa a homo sapien at any stage of development which provides valid justification for making abortion illegal 
if this is an acceptable rebuttal then allow me to use it on pros entire position the abortion laws could be wrong 
of course anyone has the right to withhold consent before or even during sex but that is not at all what we are talking about 
so saving the  year old does not prove the embryos lack personhood there could be many reasons for making that choice 
this is a more formal presentation of the argument that an embryo is just with no consciousness or self awareness suggesting it is not human 
again i never presented an absolute right to life argument so hopefully this is the last we hear of it 
my point with this rebuttal is to show that pros personhood criteria are insufficient and would qualify other groups of people for death in addition to embryos which is not reasonable 
if pro chose to save their child is it because their spouse was a non person 
the right to life as an absolute is untenable pro phrased this argument in round  as a rebuttal 
 year old if anyone has failed to engage this argument it is pro 
as such my entire argument is in a sense a response to this 
pro has not disputed my claim that a genetically unique homo sapien is created upon conception other than saying a human person must exhibit  additional criteria 
pro misses the larger point here the uvva legally defines an unborn child at any stage of development as a full human with rights equal to those of the mother 
nor have i advocated for an ex post facto law that criminalizes all past and present abortion 
but if i told you that same intersection has had ten fatal car crashes any sane person would want a stop sign put up 
think about it this way if i told you that an intersection without a stop sign has only experienced one fatal car crash in it is history you would not think anything of it 
 your right ones right to live should not be restricted unless justified and i do not think abortion justifies it 
i would not want either to die but given the choice between taking the life of  or  i would chose only the  
 this is a claim or something similar i hear all to often in the abortion debate 
if you ever wondered why some regard the pro life as anti woman it is because of things like this 
i will be arguing against you for i believe abortion is immoral and unethical 
vote for con to protect of the little human organism trying to make it into the world 
at the third trimester virginia state says now we think abortions at this juncture should not be legal anymore for some reason 
 consciousness  reasoning  self motivated activity  the capacity to communicate  the presence of self concepts and self awareness if we use pros criteria to terminate living human organisms there will be no restrictions in abortions there will be living human organisms outside the womb that can be terminated 
i know the appearance is not pretty during the embryotic period but it still a whole human trying to make it to the next stage in maturity 
 therefore i submit that pro does not have a clear point when a human organism should be protected 
there is no clear point for pros side with only statements of 
my argument is that protecting the potentiality of human life is at a clear point human life begins at fertilization 
doctors have test urine or blood to indicate presence of hcg to confirm a woman is pregnant 
I am not sure why pro uses in the claim if you do not really mean restricted 
pro is trying figure out in what sense iinnocent so what i mean is a is not responsible for or directly involved in the abortion yet suffers the abortion consequences 
 I am not ignoring any contentions i think it is more appropriate for me to clarify before any further rebuttals and i will use my last round to finish any rebuttals and to finish my side of the debate 
i talk about things like  day human embryos human organism human fetus embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization etc etc 
i m simply saying abortions should be illegal during the embryonic period as well as with the rest of the pregnancy without stating any wording of the law or wording of the penalty or wording of any exceptions to the law 
what exact point in a pregnancy event horizon if you will that you think abortion is no longer appropriate 
it would because people to be mentally unstable 
i need help 
send me a challenge if you do I am up for it 
sure feel free to start it again 
hopefully you will be back in the next round 
none of this actions in and of themselves are ethically justified it is wrong to kill and it is wrong to steal but in light of the reason why they were stealing or why they were killing we accept it as a necessary evil 
it is not a house yet and following the logic presented here we treat it as a bunch of  nailed together and standing upright 
at the least its not possible to say you are ethically justified in ignoring the negative thing which occurred just as you cannot say that a woman is ethically justified in having sex and then aborting the child because she has no moral obligation to keep it 
i think here it is important to stop and define exactly what it means to be ethically justified 
we do not treat peach seeds like peach trees and accordingly we should not treat a fetus like a fully gown human being 
you had the ability to make the conscious choice to not go to sleep for one night just as we have the ability to choose to not engage in sex without protection or birth control 
however i will go as far to say as an abortion is not ethically justified if you have the foreknowledge that having sex with someone could lead to a child 
to be ethically justified an action must be drawn from the principles of basic human ethics i e it is wrong to kill etc 
in the same manner we do not necessarily treat a fetus like a fully grown human being but we treat it in a certain manner because we have knowledge of what it has potential to be 
you do not go to sleep with the prior knowledge that you may potentially wake up attached to a violinist in dire need of your kidneys 
an ethically justifiable action is one with the property such that by taking the basic set of principles that define basic human ethics such as murder is wrong theft is wrong etc 
after that period it seems to me that as the fetus gains fully human facilities it should gain increasing moral significance 
i think i have clearly established a framework to view this debate clearly defined what it means to be ethically justified and shown that abortion cannot be ethically justified 
yet to believe personhood can be turned on and off like a light switch or that it would be permissible to kill a temporary comatose patient seems absurd but this is what a performance approach entails 
this point is relatively uncontroversial as ultra liberal moral philosopher peter singer explains there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being 
second as patrick lee points out this organism is fully programmed actively to develop himself or herself to the mature stage of a human being and will do so if unharmed  
on such a view the type of being is what grants personhood and all human beings including the unborn share the quality of having a disposition as a moral agent regardless of performance 
even the alien persons would be protected in this scenario as a being with this valuable property flo 
conclusioni want to close with the words of moral philosopher rosalind hursthouse who perfectly captures the profound nature of the issue to think of abortion as nothing but the killing of something that does not matter 
abortion may be a contentious moral issue but providing easily accessible healthcare to women for example should not be controversial in the least 
indeed singer whom pro cites admits as much we can see that the grounds for not killing persons do not apply to newborn infants 
his cultured aliens would be persons due to the type of creature they are de facto rational agents 
it also covers most adults as they have this desire and arguably even infants who have the implicit desire to live and it excludes the unborn 
as such both infanticide and the killing of the disabled would be morally permissible on his view as neither would be persons with a right to life 
slippery slope assuming pro holds that animals are not persons his restrictive performance criteria would have to exclude infants and people with low iqs 
not only that but if pro s cultured aliens managed to operate without desires this account would exclude them as well 
as this round is primarily for acceptance I will quickly introduce some brief definitions and then allow pro to make his opening case 
it is great to debate a fellow brit especially such a well established member on such an important topic 
abbreviationspc pro choicepl pro lifeto avoid equivocation over stages of development in pregnancy I will also use the term as an all encompassing label 
the law says that your parents are responsible for your education health and well being 
 legal aspects of healthcare administration george d pozgar the body of law as it applies to minors is based on the constitution however as a minor you are subject to the instructions and policies set forth by your parents 
while the bible is not the best source of morality i would agree i was merely stating even back then people wrote about the rights of a minor and the obligations of the parents 
parental authority in operating an orderly household trumps all else if these conditions are met 
in the mythical world you would live in a  yr old would be thrown into the streets to fend for him herself and a  old can do as he pleases and if he is harmed so be it there is no moral obligation of the parent to see no harm comes to their child and to you the harm to a child is justice for the child actions 
as for my mother she was a black slave for a magian as for my name he has named me jual beetle and he has not taught me even one letter from the quran 
so you have made mistakes against him before he has made mistakes against you bible children obey your parents in the lord for this is right 
however making the decision to marry join the army have or not have a child to vote on your governmental leaders these are lifes biggest decisions and a  yr old is just not wise nor educated enough to have the freedoms to make these decisions on their own 
there is a moral foundation for the laws as they exist and that is to protect minors from themselves 
 children have the right to be treated equally vis a vis their siblings in terms of financial gifts

abortion the use or prescription of any instrument medicine drug or any other substance or device intentionally to terminate the pregnancy of a female known to be pregnant with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth to preserve the life or health of the child after live birth or to remove an ectopic pregnancy or the products from a spontaneous miscarriage 
d after parental consent is withheld the minor may go to a court of jurisdiction and request to over turn of the parental wishes

again in response to the justification of animals being slaughtered i will save my response for another debate that is only dealing with proof that god does or does not exist which can then lead to a discussion of the factuality of the bible 
i understand that for this debate we should only be focusing on the two issues i initially brought up so i will refrain as much as possible from my faith onto your arguments as i have complete respect for the many other beliefs people have and obviously yours to be specific 
at first glance i thought you were trying to say that absolutely no other form of punishment existed but i now realize that you were trying to justify the death penalty in a society where absolutely no other form of punishment existed 
my whole argument does not depend on the morality or immorality of the topic but rather depends on how i believe god would handle the situation 
bible i personally will never try to push my faith on anyone that does not accept it but i will continue to use my faith as the foundation of my arguments 
i will also go on to say that I am guessing this debate has no further meaning amongst either of us because my beliefs on abortion come from what i believe is in the bible 
even if you were a vegetarian why would the issue of abortion be more pressing than these animals when the amount of animals slaughtered for consumption is notably greater than the fetuses being aborted in addition to the fact that the animals consumed are fully formed 
and yes we do agree that the issue of adoption does become a lot more complicated but that has nothing to do with the proposition being a solution or not 
it results in whether or not you think it is absolutely necessary for the woman to have an abortion 
it is hard to take in the viewpoint of someone who says i do not believe in abortion but i would opt to have one under a certain circumstance 
i am running out of characters to use for this argument and this would take me quite a while to show you the dozens of ways you are taking biblical text out of context but i will refrain and again encourage you to start up a debate dealing with this particular topic if you so choose to further my biblical arguments i have made 
which is why i feel so strongly that our government should be willing to provide more housing for them like i feel they should also spend money on the building of more prisons to eliminate the overcrowded prison problem that already exists in our country 
obviously if the government is not willing to provide much more housing for the growing number of orphans then yes it is easy to see that the illegalization of abortion would compile overcrowded environments 
i also agree that supply exceeds demand by a long shot but i disagree that the problem would be so long as there is a government willing to spend money on better programs and houses for orphans 
allow me to just say that my next points referring to the slaughtering of animals and human babies of any development come from a biblical view and my faith that lies in god 
hunting and killing animals that are wild and attack men or their domesticated animals is not considered evil either as david in the old testament had to kill a lion and a bear to protect his sheep as a part of his shepherds duty 
the diligent hunter takes his game for food roasting and considers it a precious possession as he has food for his familys table 
though from the  century through present day we have become much more civilized i still hold strong that courts of some sort and prisons did exist which would obviously serve as an alternate to the death penalty 
we could both agree that most of the present nations do not kill each other for food and we certainly do not kill babies for food 
i could name other atrocities of killing animals which take place with evil motives but i believe god looks on the heart and motives of men when it comes to how we treat his creatures and we shall be judged for it 
now do not misunderstand me if someone killed your friend or family member i sympathize with you completely and i do not think they should be given light treatment just because I am opposed the death penalty 
it is even worse when our court systems seek the death penalty for an inmate and solely base their judgment on the fact that our jails are crowded so we do not have the room to give this person life 
people are so worried about peace on earth and our failing economy yet look at what we are doing this very second 
but it is not right for someone to die for something completely evil they did 
and it is not like we can send our prisoners to other countries either because that obviously costs money that we do not have 
who are we to pass a life or death judgement on a human being 
since our government does not know how to regulate its spending and how to not get into further debt people must die for it 
money that piles on top of the  trillion dollars worth of debt we are in because our government can not control its spending 
it is interesting that we as a nation are so worried about how high our crime rates are yet we hypocritically turn around and legalize abortion and the death penalty 
i that we should strive to bring up wholesome children but they cannot be wholesome if they can not exist 
i have been very busy and have not had time to post much i will refute your arguments in the order you created them 
you stated that a mother would request an abortion because she cannot just using one example have the baby inside her body please tell me how one would not be able to maintain a child in her womb 
 there are many more bible verses that prove that abortion is the shedding of innocent blood violation of the golden rule attempts to destroy the work of god encourages sin degrades human life disannuls the plan of god and shows lack of faith which i will gladly present in the next round if the circumstances are favorable 
and then in  the you s supreme court finished roe v wade and initially made abortion legal throughout america 
 and the baby that is eight weeks old or more than endures real physical pain 
 my argument completely states that the law sees the baby as a human being and therefore avoid killing the mother until she completes giving nourishment to it p  p s   
it also has an impact to young people where they would know that there is no severe effect for that primary doing 
 to think the fetus heart starts beating at  days and began to send brainwaves from his brain in  days these factors are used by the law to verify death brain and heartbeat 
if men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart from her and yet no mischief follow he shall be surely punished according as the womans husband will lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine 
by damaging the simplest human bond of all a mother and a child abortion breaks down the valued glue that unites america 
 for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mother s womb 
in the old testament god required death penalty to mothers who gave birth to a child prematurely and dies 
and there is a possibility that the baby has a better life than anybody else refer to my statement in round  
psalm    elaborates it clearly that he was there personally and not as a blotch of tissue that later developed into his human figure 
there is a possibility that your baby would be incomplete and a less chance of delivering a normal birth 
it started with an intercourse and then the sperm penetrates with the ovum fertilizes and a new human life has begin no need for source 
 how did abortion become legal in the you s 
thank you minddrag for challenging me into this debate 
 one is either for human life as a right or thinks human life is a privilege granted by law or society since pro life refers to abortion this stance is based on protecting the life of the innocent not the guilty which capital punishment addresses 
pro seems to be the one trying to change that 
no that is why we have dictionaries to ensure that we are all speaking the same language 
if pro is trying to argue that the definition does not or should not mean what people think it does then his argument would still be irrelevant 
my opponent has either badly misinterpreted the term pro life or is simply trying to affirm that pro life does not or should not mean what people think it does 
the level of disingenuousness of those that make these claims can only be judged by how they define pro life not how pro defines it 
abortion should be restricted because some people will become irresponsible having unprotected sex knowing that she will do abortion and it can increase rates of infection 
it might seem funny for me to say that but due to the politically homogenous nature of my environment i was not sure 
b before i read your topic i would have said absolutely yes a living human is a person 
i do not believe they would qualify as human but not having a degree in biology i can not be sure 
i would counter that seperated skin cells are not living which i believe is accurate though i might be mistaken 
the government can ban a breed of dog and put down animals against the will of the owners in some cases 
if you define personhood genetically a fetus is as much a person as you or i and entitled to the same fundamental rights 
if you went hunting and you had because to think that there may be a person hiding in a bush you would be morally and legally responsible if you fired into that bush and killed a person 
even if you disagree with this definition of personhood you have to wonder about it 
if we don t think about them we only can have the views fed to us by the media and our parents 
i think we need to cut  weeks because the  is not the morally relevant dividing line 
you are not suggesting when fetuses feel pain they do not have an interest for the pain to stop 
if done on interests then i believe that  and certainly  should be the dividing line as then they have interests as they can feel pleasure and pain 
or do they suddenly get interests when they first see daylight 
for that reason if we see that politics and law are not working to stop the two year old killer we should engage in defense of others and shoot the man killing the children 
how is it not her fault that she did not abort earlier when morally grayer even the law recognizes no absolute right and how not her fault that she is at least partially responsible for the childs existance etc 
he did not comply with rules that determine how to determine viability etc 
the only reason i mentioend it hte way i did is because in that last post i responded to con ended with comparing it to a blob 
at  weeks the baby is viable can live on its own 
con seems to say if it is late in the pregnancy do not abort 
the only distinguishing point you make is how advanced the two year old is compared to the unborn baby 
as it sits now he has no reason aside from the arbitrary location of hte baby to say it is not developed enough yet when had it been born instead of terminated by law it would have been advanced enough 
if con had used the mothers autonomy at least he would have made an arguable distinction 
most abortions are performed entirely voluntarily by women that have the means to raise a child but simply do not want to 
for example in  only  of women in the us cited health risk as the reason for abortion 
most had social reasons i e were not ready did not want a baby a baby would interfere with their career etc 
another is that it rids the woman of any responsibility for her sexual actions and that she did not protect herself in other words there are condoms and other contraceptives which one should use if one does not want a child including abstention 
i was born with  mrntal illnesses so i empathize but i feel i have the moral right to live 
my councelor says I am probirth control not prolife but i do suooport humans from genetic conception to death 
god created you for a reason 
did you know that god had a plan for you before you were born that is being played out right now 
anywhoo despite our differences i feel sad that you do not love yourself enough to assert your right to live before birth 
do you honestly feel your mother had the right to kill you before you were born 
i ask that neither me nor my opponent show dead people pics 
that will most likely end her education and because her to work at mc 
i think so most people make stupid decisions in their life especially in high school where they can not think about the future and if they do have children can they take care of it 
i think not and most parents will be angry with their children 
by medical standards human life begins at conception 
for the purpose of debate by accepting this challenge the opponent agrees to the following definition abortion the intentional termination of a pregnancy by surgical procedure in which the death of the fetus is an intended result 
i appreciate your concession 
unfortunately my opponent simply assumes that a womans right to trumps the innocent babys right to life 
many people would say that an innocent persons right to life is the most important right above any other rights 
it seems that my opponent admits that abortion is the killing of a human person 
something inside of us cries against this position even if we try to rationalize it away 
finally after a rape scenario what a woman primarily needs is love and a restoration of that dignity which has been so horribly snatched away from her not an abortion 
unfortunately my opponent has not clarified what he means by 
pro shall have the bop to show that abortion is morally permissable in certain situations 
my opponent also simply states his own opinion and commits a bare assertion fallacy 
as my graph in round  shows it is medical developments not legislature that statistically determine the danger of abortions 
introductionmy opponent seems to contradict himself in his arguments as he claims that morals do not really exist yet he bases most of his arguments on how abortion could reduce suffering 
the correlation is better explained by the fact that medical science is far more developed in countries where abortion is legal than countries where abortion is illegal and so the fact that abortion is safer in countries where it is legal is not because it is legal but instead it is down to superior medical development 
in other words it is not demonstrated that history of consciousness has any relevance to the permissibility of killing 
but for the purposes of this round or until con specifies otherwise i will presume that con believes that we ought to reduce suffering and that he is disingenuous in claiming that there are no morals 
 but this can be absurdly applied to other scenarios for example stealing is dangerous so it is also cruel to risk a womans health possibly life because they disagree with one on stealing 
no it does not the reason why this is fallacious is because the height and hairiness of people is not relevant to whether we are justified in killing them 
so i am not sure as to which position con actually believes as the assertion that we ought to reduce suffering coupled with the assertion that there are no morals is a contradictory pairing 
we would be just as justified in killing them outside the womb since the reason why we are killing them in the first place is not dependent on whether they are born or not 
 the thing is whether a person is born or not has no relevance to the eugenical aim of why we are killing them 
finally con writes it is also cruel to risk a womans health possibly life because they disagree with one on abortion 
in other words just because someone believes that a wrong action is right it does not entitle them to considerations of their safety when undertaking said act 
although the fatal flaw in the argument lies in cons last line i understand that going around killing people with disorders is very bad but abortion is different as i have explained 
as this is a morally abhorrent and absurd conclusion the initial premise that we can justify killing in order to improve the genepool must be false 
abortion whether therapeutic or illegal is in the main no longer dangerous because it is being done well by physicians  finally it is not as if women are forced to have abortions if they do then the problem to be solved is the fact that they are being coerced the vast majority are seeking an abortion out of their own free choice 
if abortion is justified in order to improve the human genepool the justifications are not logically limited to the unborn 
whether someone is conscious at present does not affect whether they will go on to live a future life which is the reason why killing is wrong in the first place explained in round  
yet even if we do know for certain that the childs life will be made miserable because of its parentage which we definitely do not the proposition that we are justified in killing rape children to prevent them from suffering has absurd conclusions namely that we would be morally and legally obliged to kill anyone if we perceived that their life would contain suffering 
the latter is an actual human being that will go on to live a future life the former has the potential to form a human being and as such will not go on to live a future life the sperm ceases to exist at fertilisation 
hence the killing of a foetus is not permissible whereas the killing of a sperm is permissible as the latter is not being denied the opportunity to live a future human life 
even if a woman is raped there is no reason why this should render the killing of a foetus as morally permissible 
a sperm is fundamentally different to a foetus in such a way that killing the former is permissible whereas killing the latter is not 
nobody denies that having to carry the child of your rapist will be probably be mentally unsettling but in order for this to be shown to be a justification for abortion it must be demonstrated that this is a less preferable event than the killing of the foetus 
a sperm does not have a potential future human life all it has the potential to do is fertilise an egg nothing more 
therefore the argument fails because  millions more die if abortion is legal and  banning abortion would not have a significant effect on womens health 
  furthermore the legality of abortion has no immediate affect on their safety as the medical director of planned parenthood wrote ninety percent of illegal abortions are being done by physicians 
moreover the fact that the majority of rape children are living ordinary lives and are not suicidal is testament to the fact that they prefer the chance to live their life as opposed to being killed in order to spare them potential suffering 
if someone is killed then they have their whole future life eliminated whereas undergoing nine months of unwanted pregnancy is a temporary period of physical discomfort 
definitionsabortion a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy and because the death of the fetus  immoral not morally good or right      rebuttalsno excessive argumentation regarding semantics 
he seems quite convinced that abortion is morally justifiied so i anticipate a lively intellectual discourse with him 
 to a debate regarding the morality of abortion 
therefore my opponents arguments that consciousness or at least potential consciousness allows human beings to be killed are exposed to not stand up to scrutiny or at least they do not justify abortion 
my opponent also says that comatose patients have been conscious before but aside from this not having any clear relevance it is not always the case 
however we do not criminalise acts purely on the basis of societys self interest we criminalise on the basis of what is moral to do 
i agree that there is no instrumental purpose to the foetuss life but if we judge ones right to life on instrumental value then we would be justified on killing the dying elderly without their consent 
the negation of an incoherent conclusion must be true so the maxim do not kill others must be true 
my opponent states that stealing is detrimental to society where abortion is not and so the former ought to be illegal and the latter legal 
the utilitarian and deontological theories are enough support of the premise that the killing of human beings apart from self defence is immoral 
my opponent asks a legitimate question why should we be consistent in our moral assertions 
as my opponent shares my conceptual objection to evolutionary ethics i will not waste my character count defending an ethical theory i do not even support 
anencephaly is similar to someone who has had his head shot by a rifle the person will die and has no brain activity but we would not be justified in actively killing this person the most ethical because of action is to let them die naturally as they will 
i congratulate him though as i rarely meet someone who defends abortion as well as he does 
if we also allow anything that is not detrimental to society then there would be no reason why an abortion is justified and the murder of a  month old baby living on taxpayers money is not so long as both deaths are painless 
one could argue that if a foetus is unwanted then its life will not be happy but this is a gross assumption considering that many people who have been unwanted as infants have gone on to live happy lives 
just to say though there is a difference between keeping an anencephalic foetus alive and actively dismembering poisoning it as is the case in abortion 
in a similar way we are not justified in killing anencephallic foetuses but we ought to let them die naturally instead 
just as a bungee jumper may die after his cord snaps he inadvertently consents to the possibility of death when he consents to act dangerously 
if we recognise that an action is immoral then we ought to criminalise it simply because it is immoral just because it will not stop the action happening altogether it does not mean we ought to legalise it 
often abortion actually harms womens mental health  so it would be not necessarily help to have an abortion after being raped 
my opponent mentions that to force a woman to keep the child of the rapist is incredibly immoral but he does not justify this assertion 
to summarise women who die in illegal abortions bring it upon themselves nobody forced them to have an abortion 
this is because there is currently less of a stigma towards single parenthood so less social pressure to abort and medical hygiene has improved on a general scale  
rebuttal of argument  the next argument in favour of the morality of abortion is that it should be allowed in cases where the child has extreme birth defects 
therefore as foetuses are in a temporary state of unconsciousness we ought not to kill them 
rebuttal of argument  my opponents first argument roughly states that the value of a human life is its consciousness and therefore a foetuss lack of consciousness is the moral justification for killing it 
if we are to make a correct ethical decision then we ought not to be influenced by pity 
he does not voice his opinion on whether patients in temporary comas should be kept alive but i will assume that he agrees they should be 
why abortion is immoral my argument is as follows premise  abortion is the deliberate killing of a human foetus premise  a human foetus is alive and so therefore a human foetus is a living human being premise  it is immoral to remove the life of a human being conclusion abortion is immoral now i will support my premises premise  abortion is defined as expulsion from the uterus of the products of conception before the fetus is viable 
there are many reasons why i am justified in asserting this moral truth rule utilitarian approach having a rule stating do not kill human beings will result in a greater amount of happiness than the absence of such a rule therefore this it is moral to abide to this rule 
if my opponent disagrees and argues that killing of human beings is morally justified aside from cases of self defence then he will have the burden of proof as he is making the positive claim that killing of human beings is morally justified 
  we know due to the definition of viable in this context that this procedure will necessarily kill the foetus 
 unless of course the pro abortionist would consent to being killed if they were a human foetus but i highly doubt they would be serious in holding this conviction 
summarily the killing of human beings is immoral according to the vast majority of normative ethical theories 
deontologist approach killing of a human being is wrong because it is a maxim that cannot be universalised no rational human being would freely consent to live in a society that permitted the killing of human beings 
i will be arguing that abortion is generally immoral in all cases apart from when the mothers health is at serious risk 
reality is that less than  of all abortions are enacted because of these reasons the  is simply for the sake of convenience or desire 
 it sounds like value and what that includes determines the weight on the scales of a mothers desires vs 
when does a newborn or a child not feel any degree of pain or pleasure and still lives 
if you agree with me that feeling is the morally relevant factor for value then  weeks should be the abortion limit 
can you give me this morally relevant factor and explain why animals are not included and fetuses are 
because that would mean the fetus value depends on its ability to feel which is not at all a very scientific or ethical way to determine value 
 an adult human life unaware of the pain or negative consequences would have value where the unfeeling fetus does not as the adult human though not being aware does have the capacity to feel pain 
this reason for value necessarily puts a milestone marker on when this value starts 
the fetus is either valuable or not and i think abortion becomes wrong when the fetus becomes valuable 
abortion is legal in the uk up to  weeks 
it is true that pro abortion activists feel the fetus is not ahuman and does not have rights 
it is almost a given that the mothers consent should be given before any drug enters her body or any abortion occurs 
however the fetus has the dna used to develop a human body and organs 
if you take the time to read my first paragraph and have an iq above  you would understand that i said that sex based abortion is sexist 
kind regards someone with an iq above  
the topic is you are which means against meaning you disagree that i am pro meaning i agree that is is misogyny 
your previous round is a prime example of you use name calling in your debate which shows you are not only not worth my time of arguing but also a bad debater 
you are supposed to be arguing that you are not for the abortion of children based on their sex however it would seem as if you are 
it is possible to choose the gender of your child through sperm seperation if you want to do that 
i believe it is sexist and wrong to murder baby girls for their gender 
the fact that a parent will choose whether or not the child is allowed to continue its growth and life depending and based on gender is  misogynistic 
 see this is late on in pregnancy when the child is already developing 
the child regardless of gender should be allowed to continue to grow and to live out it is life regardless of their gender 
my opponent forfeited 
extend all arguments 
even if a family can put the child up for adoption this may not make the childs life any better nor the mothers life 
this can have detrimental effects on a womans life health and sanity as well as other negative repercussions eg 
statistic shows that  of all pregnant women experience health problems and  of women endure complications that are considered life threatening 
now i shall present my case 
there are not enough parents willing to adopt children meaning babies will be placed in orphanages at the expense of tax payers 
con must present reasons for why adoption is the solution to abortion 
adoption to take into ones family through legal mean and raise as ones own child 
note this is not a pro life or anti abortion vs pro choice argument 
breaking this rule is an automatic forfeit i as con need not provide a case only rebut pros 
but it is rare that one has the mind to concede when he has lost 
a higher rape rate would drive many to not have abortions as rape in many of these countries is the only case abortions are allowed 
 all of these outcomes more out of wedlock births fewer adoptions than expected and less pressure on men to do the right thing led to a sharp increase in single parent families 
as john lott notes he is a very respected man in the debate on both sides to understand why abortion might not cut crime one should first consider how dramatically it changed sexual relationships 
for example the data used for the you k was not replicated and the trend was overall increasing even after controls for other variables where put on and at best had no effect on overall crime 
foreign levitt made this claim to prove it had an international effect and this was an outrageous claim that was investigated by scientists and never replicated 
first that one positive impact is outweighed by the negative ones and second that data is un replicated and suffers from methodological problems 
as we can see in all of the countries where it is legal other factors explain the high abortion rates 
again most analysis s show abortion had many more adverse social effects then positive ones which logically means levit s hypothesis is weak and that it is more likely it increases crime 
yet when we look at the declining murder rate during the  we find that this is not the case at all 
 children raised out of wedlock have more social and developmental problems than children of married couples by almost any measure from grades to school expulsion to disease 
in the middle east they are in many wars and polygamy is very common 
it was only later that criminality among those born after roe began to decline 
many reside in africa the middle east or in latin america 
 science and hebrew tradition on the method of zadig p  we can agree science should be able to often predict phenomena and the theory should be able to be correct right 
the study found however the data failed to control for many controls 
if i was stating the question in scientific form i main question would be when do you define a baby someone say it is as some as a sperm and egg meet others say a certain amount of weeks 
in all types of situation it is wrong to kill a baby even if they were an accident would you kill your know child if he she is an accident 
if you would not vote for me i think as soon as the sperm and egg meet it is a new live 
so when you think about it your committing murder 
well  million means more diapers food and formula 
not become homeless or something stupid like what you said 
if a law passes where there is no abortion if you do get one you will go to prision for murdering a baby 
that is enough for a whole state 
but when a human life is the subject of the question it is still a heinous act to condemn that child to a death before it was even properly born 
i am sure we can all agree that life on this planet humans more so than any is protected and cherished 
no matter whether or not it cannot voice it is own defense and is spoken for by the mother it is a protected human life 
by inference it would also be a crime to the developing child and end it is life sadly before it even got to see the bright of the world 
well to introduce my views i will not be using anything quoted from religion or from the bible and i myself am not religious in any way 
taking away the chance to experience life is heinous 
i can concede that we need to provide euthenasia for children that will be at a disadvantage or will endure a particularly stressful life such as someone born with aids a terminal disease or born out of incest or rape 
this is an outlandish comparison as an appendix is a useless part of the human anatomy while a fetus is the development stage of a conscious being 
this right shall be protected by law and in general from the moment of conception 
obviously this points to the bare fact that a human fetus does esentially deserve rights 
also the long standing position of the american convention of human rights upheld since  states that every person has the right to have his life respected 
this decision effectively characterizes a fetus as a legal victim and by this decision it can be inferred that it has the rights of an individual 
from the moment of it is conception a fetus has certain traits that would define it as a person 
yes our societies do strive to affirm life as much as possible and to make the quality of life of our citizens as high as possible 
for one the child is by this point devoloped and fully a human life so why should we be allowed to kill an unborn baby but not another adult human being 
i guess my only choice is to forfeit this debate 
sorry to my opponent that my internet was wacked up 
if you would like a redo please contact me 
if rights do not objectively exist then you can not say that a woman has objective bodily rights and you could not say objectively that the rapist and the kidnapper was wrong 
the huge problem with their argument is that if rights come from our own interest then that also means that the rapist and the kidnapper also get to define what rights we have 
in my opening argument i established that what makes someone have the right to life is the fact that they are human 
it was then stated that s body against her will a fetus carries out exactly this kind of aggression 
that said it is ridiculous to say that the mother has these rights when my opponent can not even establish that these bodily rights objectively exist 
otherwise there would be no rights at all and my opponent would have no argument for bodily rights 
so i am curious if the examples where mothers hurt themselves due to abortion being made illegal are just as common as abortions harming the mother 
while someone might save the child instead of the  embryos this would not show that the embryos were not human and vice versa 
i was not saying that there was no such thing as bodily rights but unless they can back up that claim objectively then their argument falls apart 
i have already made an argument for why humans have a positive right to life 
this would only show that the emotions of a person impacts their decision 
if there is an objective right to life then the human embryo gets that right as well 
i spent my whole opening argument proving that being human makes you have the right to life 
my opponent says i did make the argument that rights derive from our own interests desires but more importantly taking cons denial approach means rape kidnapping people and taking a kidney have not done something wrong since there was no bodily rights to be violated in the first place 
and if they decide to deny the existence of rights altogether then their whole argument falls apart and this debate comes down to me showing that rights exist objectively 
another argument against abortion is that since a cell in the human body has human dna and is alive and because it is okay to kill it therefore it makes no difference to kill the cells of a fetus 
the argument about the personhood of the fetus is very flawed since the people who make the claims have not really thought about what a person really is 
for example people say that these aliens would have the morality of a human the same functions of a human unlike a real alien and etc 
and if a person were to choose the embryos that does not make the child non human 
many people would recognize that the fetus is a human but would deny that the fetus is a person 
a fertilized egg has the nature of a whole human being which is not the case for a skin cell which only has the nature of skin 
as for the argument about people only having a negative right to life this also just isn t true 
the united states has always recognized that the life of any human is valuable 
then there is an argument about humans only having a negative right to life which means that that humans do not have a moral obligation to keep other humans alive 
so your decisions to save the son over the others does not make the others non human or less vauable 
my argument abortion should not be legal because the fetus is human and therefore has the right to life 
the very nature of the human is what makes a human being valuable 
the people who say this say that a person is someone who has moral consideration as opposed to someone who is human by nature 
not only does it presuppose the existence of aliens but the people who make this argument actually give human attributes to aliens making the aliens huaman 
our society also does not see it as an unjust burden to demand that people do not murder each other 
a person is not valuable because of their thoughts feelings or etc 
basically it is obvious that being human in nature means to have a positive right to life 
i accept this argument 
nothing changes here all we have done is just pushed back and dumped it on god 
that said i never said anything about rape cases 
i mean the embryo has done nothing wrong in any case so i do not see how my opponent sees the death of the child as valid 
so basically my opponents asserts that we have rights 
as for the quotes from carlin and harris they are emotional appeals and they do not actually discredit anything i have said 
on the other hand my opponent has made no justification as of to why the abortion should not be considered murder 
but all my opponent has presented are assertions about what rights we have 
this is why we look to reason and consequence beyond just mere assertion of said rights 
no conflict of rights interests in the embryonic period con points that rapists can just assert what rights we have presumably in such a way to allow rape 
they can not objectively establish rights and this causes their argument to fall apart 
that is why i spent my whole opening argument explaining why being human makes it not okay for the baby to be killed 
they have only addressed things said in my rebuttals of their arguments 
my whole thing about the death penalty was that not everyone agrees that it should be used at all 
my point was that objective rights could only exist with the existence of a god 
con can not have it both ways either con assumes such bodily rights exist that make rape kidnapping wrong in which case con can not complain or con continues to deny such bodily rights in which case i argue that con is forced to deny such bodily rights in order to justify their side of the debate 
now that they see that that position fails now they are buying into the 
but i never really went into specific details because i do not think i have to 
it may harm him temporarily but it will save a life which under a negative utilitarian view is the superior obligation 
not only have you done this but you have assumed away the laws of logic by having the second option deny a principle because it would lead to pain otherwise 
personhood i would like to contend with everything after  
one five year old vs one hundred one hundred days old embryos once again you have to do the arithmetic 
  should not be a test of humanity because it applies to literally almost all other organisms on earth 
it is based on the idea that the people against abortion have a double standard 
if abortion is murder the two options you present are not the only ones 
the number of women with these types of abortions are small 
you say that there are endless rows of women who have had abortions during the embryonic stage 
for the record i will not be citing philosophers professors or any other person unless i take an idea directly from them 
as for the assumption that i can not have science alongside my argument and still have morality this is false 
the only organs that would not be touched are those organs which are absolutely necessary for the life of an individual 
since a mom v fetus scenario does not exist than we can safely rule that this is an irrelevant point 
my criteria is the superior criteria because it actually shows that not everything is a person it is based on a rational empirical view of the world rather than the vague science denying notions of my opponent and it actually includes people who are sleeping as people people sleeping do not tick off any boxes in that   checklist 
my opponent says that i am wrong because usage of science which cares not for morality means that i can not prove that i am moral but i can prove that abortion is the act of a human killing a human 
in fact i can say that the two are intertwined but that is a discussion of personal philosophy that is inappropriate for this debate venue 
bodily autonomy when i said that the flood gates were not open i meant that was a hyperbole that did not truly apply 
i said that there are situations in which abortion will end in less death and that those situations are acceptable nothing else 
from what i understood from their first argument i can conclude that this is when a zygote dies on its own and is than removed 
secondarily my definition of people is directly contrasting to this so much that i need not expressly deny it 
 mom v fetus my opponent failed to address the fact that a scenario where it is mom vs a fetus does not really exist today 
when you say that science points out that your criteria has problems in practice which is self admitted you point out a fatal flaw 
it is even worse to kill somebody who can not say no and can not stand up for themselves 
though in this last round i will likely come off as a little annoyed i promise that this is not the case 
if they are killed by another human than it is murder 
cons neg util  bodily autonomy previously covered  prevention of suffering and risks death stopping death does justify anything and everything except causing more death to do so 
it may not be as capable of using that knowledge as humans are but it still has that knowledge 
now to the rest of my rebuttal 
also considering recent advancements in technology it will not be too long before organ donation will be less necessary than before I am not going to provide a source otherwise this crosses the line from rebuttal to new point 
we can prove that a person has electric signals in the brain but as of yet we can not use this to prove anything about first person knowledge or thought 
when you are in a situation where you are the only one who can protect a human life than it is your responsibility to do so 
as for the argument about the abortion of dead eggs that is not immoral that is called cleanup 
after it came out of the chrysalis it would be on its way leaving no permanent impact on you 
there is no situation in which a fetus can be removed from a mother and still survive 
if abortion is murder when you say that you never talked about endless rows of cells i want to bring up this quote 
therefore the genetic test is the only test that can viably stand on its own because i can prove that i have human dna and i know that i have first person thoughts and knowledge and i can prove that others have human dna and i appreciate whole heartedly that i was not aborted 
we would not want the murderer to have less chance of the crime blowing up in his face 
old child vs   day old embryos you are attack on my counter to the analogy applies realism not inherent to the analogy 
 mother v fetus let me set this up with one thing first 
if you were watching one person stab another and you had a tazer in one hand and a gun in the other you would not shoot the guy being stabbed you would taze the guy with the knife 
a sea horse is not a person but it fits all five criteria 
bodily rights argument the right to life is the ultimate moral imperative for a government to maintain 
the case that i bring up is a tragic accident where two people will die unless one of them is killed 
you can use that victimization to better rehabilitate those in need of rehabilitation but you can not ever use victimization as a reason to not rehabilitate 
a fetus still has human instincts it knows how to eat and breathe before it is even born so that idea that a fetus is a brainless piece of non human thing is wrong government should pay for abortion when it is dealing with rape and incest 
abortion is just an easy way out for when a woman decides that she had her fun but does not want the responsibly that follows when being a mother 
a fetus is a human it has skin organ systems a body is the fetus a human yes a underdeveloped human but still a human 
my opponent argues that a woman should be allowed to change her mind when it comes to having a child well she can change her but she can not just kill a child so she does not have raise it 
but the line must me drawn in the sand when it comes to those who made their choice by having sex and got pregnant 
abortion should not be legal to those who had consensual sex with a man and happened to get pregnant 
in fact before the supreme court case more than  of the illegal abortions were done by medical professionals with high standing in their fields 
this argument is irrelevant to the debate as it is after fertilization when a sperm and an egg become an embryo which you accept is a human being 
however rebuttals are not until round  which states pro rebuts con s case and vice versa i will proceed by refuting the arguments danielle made in round  but not his her rebuttals which i will address in round  
the  amendment states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the  amendment does not grant these rights to animals and plants but persons 
as stated in the resolution if the mother s life is truly in danger she should be able to access the proper medical procedure 
meanwhile if you intentionally shoot a man meaning to kill him or if you order or pay an assassin to do the killing the person for you then you will be charged with either murder or conspiracy of murder 
con states that violating a person s bodily autonomy has no legal or moral basis yet advocates that the bodily rights of the unborn can be violated if it yields cures to various diseases 
con fails to make a connection why the actions of people should be related to how the pro life ideology should be judged 
despite the fact that slavery has been banned in over  countries we have the back alley version of slavery known as human trafficking 
the main thing wrong with this argument is that con does not prove that the human rights to life and bodily autonomy require the precedence of consciousness 
even if abortion laws do not prevent these back alley abortions there are still fundamental flaws in this argument 
 a more clear example is within the us constitution with the  amendment which states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the united states is also part of a larger coalition of countries known as the united nations therefore abides or at least should abide by protecting human rights as they define it 
even pro abortion advocates like the new scientist concede that a human zygote is a human being the task force finds that the new recombinant dna technologies indisputably prove that the unborn child is a whole human being from the moment of fertilization that all abortions terminate the life of a human being and that the unborn child is a separate human patient under the care of modern medicine 
with this data a huge vast majority of pregnancies are the result of consensual sex 
 sub argument  human rights as stated above apply to unborn babies as stated in the united nations declaration of human rights there is no distinction between human being and a person as within article vi everyone has the right to be recognized as a person before law 
 we also know that the each zygote is a distinctive human being because their dna is distinctive from either parent 
 million pregnancies every year which makes up about less than half of a percent 
if you give a cop without a permit permission to enter your house and he she finds incriminating evidence to be used at your trial the  amendment cannot be used to help you 
as human beings under such entities they are entitled to inalienable rights such as the right to life 
even if the right to privacy and bodily autonomy overrides the right to life somehow in most cases it cannot be used in most cases of abortion 
to begin with stated within the united states declaration of independance we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
 however as established before the unborn baby is due for protection under the law including the right to life 
below is an exert from an embryology textbook the development of a human being begins with fertilization a process by which two highly specialized cells the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism the zygote 
there is no objective reason why these criteria should be imposed in deciding what is human and what is not human 
full resolution the usfg should ban abortion except in cases where the mothers life is in danger 
please state your case 
I am looking forward to argue with you again with a better topic that is to both of our interest 
the topic that i made was my first i just wanted to know how this whole debate thing work 
this time it is your win 
rapist will force the victim to take abortion pill after raping her so that the victim have no physical evidence that he did rape her 
come on accept my challenge 
also it is a human being the moment when the fertilized egg is implanted in the womb 
the coment i just read did give me some insight and they are right the fetus is not the mothers body but an organisim inside it 
and all abortions are done after they are able to tell they are pregnet and if they are able to tell they are pregnet that means there is a heartbeat 
well yes a womens body is hers and she should have the right to decide yes 
abortion is murder taking away the life of an innocent unborn child 
i know this would be hard for some women to do but killing an innocent child is wrong 
that baby is innocent and has the right to at least live a life even if its put up for adoption so its not there to be a constant reminder to the mother and it can be a closed adoption 
abortion should be banned because abortion is murder and taking away an unborn childs chance at life 
no it should not be legal 
first of all i apologize for not posting anything i have been quite busy 
by killing a child you are taking away his or her chance to benefit or contribute to society in any way 
my opponent said that abortion is not murder because the child does not know it 
it does not make sense to say that murdering a child is not murder because the child does not know it 
i would like to thank my opponent for a great debate about this topic and i urge the judges to vote against abortion 
and given the fact that   of women have an abortion the number of breast cancer cases is a lot 
in this situation if i used an appeal to emotion i would have made the person i was trying to persuade feel an emotion in order to convince them 
if a person truly does not want their baby then they can send it to adoption 
i want to take a step back a minute and look at the argument of abortion as a whole 
even if abortion was the reason crime rate went down and abortion became illegal we can still keep the crime rate down by sending these kids to the adoption center and get a good family and live a good life 
my last argument is that babies are alive and are technically us citizens by law 
if you go to the websites they both say that if doctors are in utter refusal to do an abortion then they will lose their job 
irish times org they both say that the reason abortion rates do not plummet is because doctors jobs are on the line 
rather than not care for them and have them grow up and be on drugs and commit crimes 
a child even if not born has a right to live no matter what 
according to fafsa org if you are alive even before birth and you are in the us then you are a us citizen 
if this happened then you would never have to do abortion in the first place and because all of these doctors to have ptsd 
so this way the baby can be raised properly and can be taught how to grow up and make good decisions 
if it does not have a choice and the baby is innocent that is murder 
if someone has a baby and knows they can not support it then they can send it to a family that is able to support 
one of the arguments that my opponent brought up is that it protects the right of privacy in that they own their own body 
if you are the baby about to be aborted whether you can feel it or not it is still murder 
let us put yourself in the babies situation for a second 
abortion should be illegal and i can give a few reasons 
doctors every day who do not believe in abortion have to kill innocent babies and often suffer from ptsd 
abortion is a harm to babies with absolutely no benefits 
when the baby is born it still needs to be protected and cared for just like the unborn 
since the unborn are humans that are innocent of crime why is there killing not murder 
the baby is physically the same in and out of the womb so how is abortion not murder 
my opponent has to prove why abortion should be legal 
a demon cannot be a human a human cannot be a demon 
this debate is not about demon possessed unborn babies 
I am talking about humans and not demons 
allowing abortion deprives the world of the very knowledge and ability that child could have brought it 
what ever that child could have done for the world is gone 
abortion should be murderwhat would be the difference between someone having an abortion and someone killing a child that is fully developed 
first round for opening position statement and acceptancesecond round for opinion and pointsthird round for rebuttali believe that the practive of abortion is murder and should be banned by the government 
the sharia law example was just to show that there could be an immoral state some may argue syria or iraq in  and that therefore laws should come from a more objective maybe utilitarian standpoint rather than merely a social contract 
i advocate utilitarianism and i hold that if we all have these rights we feel a lot happier and safer and that is essential to happiness 
there is a sanctity of life and that s why i would not want the mother risking her life to have a baby and abortion should be legal in these cases the vast majority of abortions are not for this reason 
your whole argument seems to rely on the view that only those in the social contract are protected so there is only an ethical system protecting a few people 
however it would not be an act they were responsible for and i think that ultimately people born in such circumstances would appreciate life even at the cost of knowing the truth 
i think i am correct in thinking you believe the man in the dessert has no rights and therefore can be justifiably slaughtered i wonder if you d want tis if you were that man 
you mention a government should prioritise over the fetus but surely exactly the same thing could be said in justification of killing a three year old who also depends on the parents efforts to survive 
i think its unfair to say that the are doomed for a bad future many men are brought up in poor homes with single mothers and turn out great 
if we universalise that killing is right then we are more likely to develop into more virtuous people and create a better society you wound not think someone who kills your dog is as capable as you as being a moral member of society 
as you have never agreed to the contract either tacitly or otherwise you have no rights and the explorers can kill you without being unjustified doing so 
however what about if you were born on a dessert island and some american explorers came to the island 
i think the social contract works best if we adopt a utilitarian law making system which encompasses all human life no matter its stage of development 
i think it likely you would agree that freedom to kill another human say if you had a three year old child that depends on you to sustain its existence 
it is barbaric and there is no way that you can change my mind or thousands of others on earth for that matter about that 
abortions because psychological damage a  review study showed that young woman who go abortion increase risk for depression 
abortion is the killing of a human being which defies god 
the killing of an innocent human is wrong even if the human has not been born 
 all arguments and sources shall be posted in the round 
 only  cross x questions allowed for both sides 
 debate resolution definitions and rules can not be changed 
the fetus has a heartbeat at  weeks old and according to the website abortion facts the fetus can feel the physical pain of being aborted 
even a child of rape is a child it is a horrible circumstance but if you acknowledge that abortion is an evil why do two evils make a good 
i guess my question is do all humans have an absolute right to life regardless of their utility 
i say this because you say that abortion is inherently wrong because it ends a life you are in effect saying that ending lives is wrong 
this looks at the value of human life as though it was a direct reflection of the utility of that person 
to your first point i think if we believe that abortion is ok then there is no need to explain why you abort someone 
thus all human life can be said to be inseparable from its personhood and thus needs to be protected as such 
embryology tells us that life starts at conception this life by virtue of having two human parents is thus a 
my second premise that all human life has an absolute right to life is the more important premise 
we have seen in the past in society that when one group of humans denys personhood to another group of humans all sorts of injustices happen 
we can further see that since this life is growing and has its only unique dna it is a human organism 
good job great debate 
i as a human being do not in that my physical body changes you will not see me develop a skin tone better suited for absorbing solar nutrients so if pro is referring to physical adaptations then i as a human being am not alive either 
finally pro said that the removal of the embryo or fetus to end a pregnancy 
the only reason anyone would contest an abortion is because it is fatal to the fetus so if the fetus can survive the abortion i will not argue that it should be illegal 
pro hinted at the argument that life for an unwanted child would be worse than no life at all so i will briefly address this point 
i do not deny that home abortions might be a current problem although i would ask pro how common they are but i propose a different solution do not get pregnant or go through with the pregnancy 
i think we can agree that a fetus has this quality it is definitely distinguishable from a dead organism 
this means that in order for abortion to be a killing a fetus must be alive and this is where the biggest pro choice argument lies 
now i do not expect to have any debate over this point either but just in case i have a definition for that too innocent not guilty of a crime or other wrong act m w  
now i know that some people say that a fetus is not alive because it cannot survive outside the womb and yet no one bothers to argue that parasites are not alive 
now i do not expect anyone to have a problem with the first premise but where i expect to see some debate is over the second premise that abortion is the killing of an innocent human so that will be what i defend in my first case 
i will set up the format for my con constructive case and then i will present my rebuttals to the pro 
no one actually defines life to be the ability to survive independently of another organism outside of the issue of abortion we still refer to our organs and parasitic creatures as 
 the free dictionary in short life is the quality that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms a pretty reasonable definition 
most pro choice arguments rest on the idea that life begins after birth and not conception 
before you argue that a child can not think research the facts first because according to www 
etc a can have brain activity as early as three months after contraception 
instead they should give the child to a family who is capable of caring for the child 
you just admitted that the embryo is a child and therefore is human 
so why is it okay for the child to be killed when he she is still in the mothers womb but it is not okay when the child is five 
as a human it is guaranteed the right to live 
even though a cannibal has the freedom of religion it is not okay for them to eat someone in their religious ritual because it violates the rights of the person being eaten 
yes you are right in the sense of protecting rights but if this religion you used as an example also required that the first born boy was used as a sacrifice that would naturally be illegal 
in the same way the right for the baby as a human being to live overrides the right for the woman to do with her body what she pleases 
abortion should not be legal because its killing a real living humans people from left might say that the women should get to choose if want to abort a baby or not 
instead they think that the fetus is under a certain category of existence where the organism is acceptable to be killed 
my opponent said that my claim is false because i said it would be appropriate to abort a baby if it affected the mothers health my argument is that a abortion for the mothers own convenience is wrong and again is like killing a human outside of the womb 
the reason that i believe that a child is human at the first stage of its life because it was created by human reproduction the embryo contains human dna the second the egg is fertilized and because it has the potential to become a fully grown human being 
so it follows that all humans born or unborn should be protected by this law and thus making abortion illegal 
but again that logic does not work to born people we do not throw away human life outside the womb when they are infants and incapable to reason their own existence 
we do not kill those with autism because they can not communicate whether they want to live or not 
further you say the unborns ability to reason makes them worthless and because they are not conscious we can just kill them 
this whole attitude that we can separate sex from procreation is nonsense to me the thought that we must end one life to keep the comfort of another is sad 
except in the case of rape a women has engaged in an act that by its nature has the possibility of creating life 
so a sperm being killed is not condidered wrong as the life does not have any worth 
a sperm on the other hand does not have the potential to be a human at least not by itself which does not make it immoral to it 
i do not believe that an abortion can be justified in any circumstance because an abortion is a murder of an innocent and i do not believe that this can be justified in any way 
it is indeed a semantic argument because you arguing this point so rigidly while of course we have to take into play the basic definition provided there is no reason why an argument should be based solely on a definition 
the point is in magnitude when having a child only   of women suffer post pardum depression and these symptoms are temporary and caused by hormonal imbalances 
also my opponent claims that babies are parasites which is not true it is a commensual symbiotic relationship and that if more women had abortions we would not have to worry about many of the problems we have 
third my opponent claims that since the woman is capable of terminating the pregnancy it is just to do so that is the same thing as saying that because i could rob a bank or kill a kindergarten class it is justified to for me to do so 
at the moment of conception i e creation the child has a right to life abortion violates this right thus it is wrong 
one because we cannot know that the fetus is not sentient two because saying it is alright to kill those who are not capable of making decisions is the same thing as saying it is okay to kill children the mentally handicapped elderly and sick because they are not capable of making decisions 
secondly my opponents defense here is completely and utterly semantic the fact that he pulls attention to my definition and indicates that where it a wider range definition it would be wrong 
fourth my opponent claims that since the fetus is not sentient there is nothing wrong with killing it this is a multiple causation fallacy 
also interesting to note that in this clause the wording means that even if the prior logic that murder is being committed is not accepted then it is still wrong unjust because the unborn childs rights are still being violated as the declaration claims that they are created equal not born equal conclusion i have presented  very basic arguments and as needed will further explain and expand them 
termination of a human fetus is murder many pro choice advocates claim that since the fetus has not yet been born it is not a human this is however incredibly untrue 
even at the earliest stage of development the fetus has it is own unique string of dna not it is mothers but even more so than that it is human dna 
also note that this round is not meant for clash of arguments but for presentation of each sides stance 
round   debate and clash use you own common sense for this 
no vulgarity keep it clean definitions these definitions are simply for structure and understanding of what this debate is about as a whole 
i do not think god approves of abortion and i disagree with the pastor 
as it is the alexander pruss argument still stands in defense of premise  of my original argument as well as the argument proposed by madeleine flannagan and I have shown that it is prima facie morally wrong to terminate a fetus based on the metaphysical claims I have proposed 
first the fact is this violinist is a stranger and is unnaturally hooked up to the woman while the fetus is mothers offspring and the fetus is naturally where it is supposed to be during development 
if it is universal right stemming from human nature based on the substance view of persons then the fetus is entitled to rights as well since these rights stem from what it is namely human with a human nature 
 a fetus is not physically independenthow does it follow that since the fetus is not independent that therefore it is not a person entitled to rights such as the right to life 
 a fetus does not qualify as a personi d like to extend the personhood argument by alexander pruss from last round as my opponent has not made any reference or refutation of it given that criteria infanticide would also be morally permissible since the baby does not exhibit number     
another issue is if we are only valuable or have rights in virtue of acquiring some property then we do not have unalienable rights 
I would like to reiterate the terms I am using and the metaphysical explanation i gave last round 
scott klusendorf notes the mothers child was conceived with her own flesh and blood and is where he naturally belongs at that stage in development the childs relation to the mother is indeed a proper one the syllogism my opponent presented is invalid 
if the fetus is a human being being raped is not a justification to terminate the child just because it will remind the parent of a painful event assuming the fetus is a person 
however on the face of it elective abortion is not morally permissible and only in an exceptional circumstance such as the one noted above is it permissible if the mothers life is at risk 
furthermore I have shown why my opponents arguments and rebuttals do not successfully demonstrate that a fetus is not a person since the arguments contain multiple flaws 
 according to the substance view of persons i still retain the same identity over time and i am entitled to unalienable rights such as the right to life property and freedom because of the very thing i am i e a human being 
there is no reason why anyone should consider abortion as an act of self defense and prudence obliges us to assume that it is a human in the absence of any good reasons to think otherwise 
he does this by presenting a self reflection of identity claiming that a fetus is a person because i was that fetus and being a person is an essential property of me pruss 
as i look through the photo album heading backwards in time I am essentially the same entity in all those photos at different stages of development from being  years old now back to when i was  years old  years old all the way back to conception 
it would be prima facie wrong to make a move and terminate the fetus when one is unsure of its personhood 
premise  on the face of it it is morally wrong to kill another human being 
it is not some foreign unknown entity or lump of cells that later became me 
lastly the embryo from conception is a whole human being because it contains the genetic constituents of human beings and its cells all work together towards the whole of the organism thus making it whole 
 now the issue is addressed by the following argument developed by francis j beckwith the unborn entity from the moment of conception is a full fledged member of the human community it is prima facie morally wrong to kill any member of that community every successful abortion kills an unborn entity a full fledged member of the human community therefore every successful abortion is prima facie morally wrong the argument is valid as the conclusion necessarily follows from its premises while assuming the premises are true 
unless my opponent states otherwise I am assuming we both agree that objective moral values exist namely that acts such as murder are wrong independently of anyones beliefs about them 
premise  follows from premise  and the conclusion from premise  and   in defense of premise one i cite an argument developed by alexander pruss that aims at demonstrating a fetus is a person with rights 
before we can advance the issue of abortion we must simplify the matter and focus on one thing what is the fetus 
 so even if all arguments for personhood fail at the moment the wisest thing to do would be to play it safe 
you are old enough to hav the responcibility of a kid 
something that has not even seen the light of day you are killing because you do not want to have that responcibility 
also many people use this as a birth control people use abortion instead just so they do not have to take the pill which is the worst case to me 
but for your other point there are a estimated     females on earth  that could reach a orgasmic point before puberty and  case of someone under puberty having a kid and she gave birth to the kid at the age of of five and raised it 
so yes if you are old enough to have the pleasure of sex your old enough to have the responsibility of a child 
but that is the unanswerable question which is more important the baby or the fetus 
while he did potentially save those men from dying in the cold the mother initiated the situation out of her own choice and in terminating it or exercising her rights is directly responsible for the death 
while i agree that the mother should have rights over her own body these rights cannot be exercised when they strip rights from others as is one of our countrys fundamental constitutional principles 
while the landlord faces no burden in saving the men he can choose to unsave them and exercise his rights 
 eviction as you have presented abortion therefore is only justified in a scenario where an equal right of the mother is being withheld 
the mother on the other hand sees a perfectly healthy child on the bank of a river and pushes him in 
surely abortion is an instance of killing a direct and decisive violation of the right as the mother is choosing to terminate the life 
the obligation to sacrifice something to save another person is certainly contentious but that does not apply to this argument 
certainly have the right to self ownership is preconditioned on being alive 
abortion is the exercise of the property rights you mentioned but exercising those rights violates the superior right to life of another 
if we are to assume that we all have equal rights acting to violate the right to life of another in the process of exercising property rights would forfeit your own right to life 
therefore a mother exercising her property rights is a rights violation in and of itself 
this is demonstrably false as anyone can fabricate thousands of worthless arguments that do not prove a point whereas even one that does is superior to them all 
the problem with the overpopulation argument is that it ignores two very important facets of human existence 
however my opponent has not objected to utilitarian morality which represents the moral value of something in terms of happiness 
rather it is like this if g is the level of happiness in the rest of the world when the woman must make their decision for abortion qa is the quality of life decrease for the aborted fetus and qn is the decrease for the woman who does not get an abortion these are the resulting happiness levels if she gets an abortion the result will be ga 
the problem lies in the resource distribution system in which large amounts of resources are concentrated into a small percent of the population 
you might say that being dependent upon its mothers resources means that it is part of its mothers body 
lastly my opponent has stated that it is absurd to represent the values of life to a mathematical equation 
most women are older than  when they are pregnant and a  decrease in the quality of life is simply absurd 
so if my opponent says that they should simply travel to each other then that would not work because either the man would not be in canada or the woman not in new zealand 
i will address these in a moment but first i will support my claim about the balance of utility between a mother and her child 
although it may seem that a mother should have the right to choose for those who cannot this is what is called virtual representation and is recognized as illegitimate in most systems 
although good statistics are difficult to find it is safe to say that as nearly  percent of births are unintended  living conditions for those born by accident are not by necessity lower than those of their parents 
my opponents only argument against this is that the quality of life for the child will be worse 
while rape and the possibility of death are certainly things we would rather avoid it is selfish to value the possibility of worsening part of ones life over the certainty of completely losing all of it 
as you are the instigator i will wait for you to post your arguments first 
it is a future life 
that is the thing its not only with our own selves you are also affecting a life that would have been born except you stopped that from happening 
i will let my opponent start with his her arguements 
to support that statement i just mentioned rising birthrate is slowly crawling its way up and to prevent that parents should be wise whether to have another child or not 
very well it depends on what danger the child or mother is in 
second  people die everyday it is normal for a baby to take their place in this world 
but the mother should just deliver the baby and raise him her just like any normal human being 
based on the word and are living organisms 
i think they should because abortion can because mental disruption 
so the definition of child in merriam webster is a son or daughter of a human parents where do you think fetus came from 
in many cases womens lives are lost through abortion 
a child did not decide that his parents would have unprotected sex 
an unborn child is always innocent and should never be punished 
they can easily give up the baby for adoption instead of doing abortion 
if they did not want the child they do not need too do abortion 
it does not matter if it does not feel pain 
abortion is wrong and it should be stopped 
it is not the unborn babies fault 
god put that baby in their stomach for a reason 
now let us consider the woman that is carrying the fetus 
organism an individual form of such as a plant animal bacterium protist or fungus a body made up of organs organelles or other parts that work together to carry on the various processes of life 
as i have shown earlier abortion is not 
it is not a person 
most abortions are teen abortions most for teens wanting to have and not think about the because and effects of what they are doing 
the big abortion question is when does life start and i think it starts when the sperm and the egg combine and the cell is created 
my opponent says the government has no right to tell people what they can cannot do with others bodies 
the woman does have control of their body she can not get pregnant 
 abortion kills babies  abortion is just an easy way out for an irresponsible woman who does not want to deal with having a child 
 if you do not want to have a baby use birth control 
 the government should not cover up for your personal mistakes 
thus the only reason to have an abortion in that frame of time is because the woman does not want to have the responsibility of raising a child 
there is no way of knowing if the baby has a health defect or if the pregnancy and consequent birth will be a problem for the mother 
she would have to be in the same mindframe as the girls who sued mcdonalds for 
statistically speaking hardly any of the abortions committed had anything at all to do with her life being in danger or because of rape less than  are because of rape or incest 
after all we are talking about more than  percent of them who fall into this category 
tells a woman what she can or cannot do with her body all the time 
 the supreme court agrees to hear the case filed by norma mccorvey known in court documents as jane roe against henry wade the district attorney of dallas county from  to  who enforced a texas law that prohibited abortion except to save a womans life 
june   norma mccorvey jane roe files a motion with the you s district court in dallas to have the case overturned and asks the court to consider new evidence that abortion hurts women 
january   the you s supreme court in a   decision affirms the legality of a womans to have an abortion 
I am ready when you are 
just because the woman is no longer pregnant does not mean they are not a mother of a child but now the are the mother of a dead child 
it may be their body but now they are sharing it with a whole other human life form 
the definition of murder is the killing of one human being by another 
every baby is a gift and a blessing this gift should not be returned 
the baby may feel no pain and after they will never feel anything 
let us get started 
but i think we could raise this baby my mother and father offered to help us with any financial difficulties and my grandparents would be able to take care of him her while we are at school 
my girlfriend and i wanted to make a life together some day to get married and to have kids but now she is carrying life inside of her as a result of rape 
conscious or not there is still life growing inside of you and to abort the baby would still be considered murder 
she was in tears at this moment explaining that she was at a party a couple of weekends ago and she had blacked out 
i could not let my girlfriend get an abortion just because some a hole slipped something in her drink at a party 
i asked her if she had taken a pregnancy test already and she said no so we went and got one 
rules you must give your person a name and state whether you are male female and what their role is gender male role boyfriend name johnny i was at my girl friends house yesterday and she said that she needed to talk to me about something so i said 
i will be debating the part of the male sense i am against the topic being stated 
my point exactly 
it fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life metabolism growth reaction to stimuli and reproduction finally is the human zygote merely a new kind of cell or is it a human organism that is a human being 
the zygote is composed of human dna and other human molecules so its nature is undeniably human and not some other species 
this dna includes a complete guiding not only early development but even hereditary attributes that will appear in childhood and adulthood from hair and eye color to personality traits 
 is the name of the first cell formed at conception the earliest developmental stage of the human embryo followed by the and stages 
at the moment when a human sperm penetrates a human ovum or egg generally in the upper portion of the fallopian tube a new entity comes into existence 
i now ask you how any one person could take away that chance from someone so innocent and incapable of deciding for themselves this to me is disgusting 
going into the discussion of womens rights as a female i do understand what women had to go through to obtain and hold these rights that we have today however many women act impulsively when deciding on abortion and this is not a subject that should be taken lightly 
if a woman did not want to get pregnant she should have taken the right precautions to secure that she would not end up pregnant 
in an il hospital in  it was discovered that the hospital was shelving babies in a dirty utility room to wait for death because the abortion did not work and the baby was born alive 
this means that a baby can feel the pain it is forced through when it is aborted 
this is sick shoving an innocent little baby into a dirty small room so the baby can die alone without even trying to save it is inhumane and indecent 
do not get me wrong I am not saying that we should women for bad decisions using their child but at least give the child a chance by putting it up for adoption or finding a couple who would be willing to adopt the baby 
i think that it is twisted and sick to murder an unborn child who has no say in whether or not they get the chance to enjoy life 
it would not be impossible to find alternate solutions to ending this life that has already begun if the choice is not to keep the child 
i look forward to hearing from someone who has a different take on this particular subject 
would our government need to drastically change yead but still as for the usa we are not bound to be overpopulated for quite a while if ever 
nobody denies that a rape victim should be able to get an abortion 
as well as this to make it even more clearer by saying a fetus is not developed you are saying a baby to be born in minutes on it is expected week is undeveloped 
those people are just dumb and are a slave to their desires and have no self control 
if you are talking about those people who have a baby at  then the should absuolutely have to carry the pregnancy to term 
my mother has been in a coma once and believe me that is not okay to just kill people in comas 
keep it civil 
however you did not reject my point that abortion is murder you merely are arguing that it should be legal in the case of rape 
however there is no reason that being pregnant should distract the girl from learning which is the main purpose of school 
your other point is that she and others will not think of the rape as much if she were to get an abortion and not be pregnant 
i want to point out that this debate specifically is asking whether or not teenage girls who are the victims of rape should have access to abortions 
development occurs throughout our lives not solely in the nine months of it that we spend in our mothers wombs 
he would then have to pay the medical bills associated with the pregnancy and serve a longer term in jail for making the victim also go through a pregnancy 
however the baby itself is an innocent bystander in the crime and it should not be given the death penalty for the rapists actions 
if a girl or woman gets pregnant as a result of a rape an additional charge should be added to the rapists charges 
also according to maureen condic a neurobiologist at the university of utah the nervous system begins to develop at  weeks and is complete by  weeks 
finally it also makes no sense to argue that the baby could not survive without its mother until  weeks as it takes several years of life before one could truly survive on his or her own 
how is it our right to determine how developed a person needs to be to qualify as a person 
if we accept that abortion is murder and morally wrong then the other question to consider is whether those circumstances are changed by being a teenage girl who was raped 
i want to move on to the general topic of abortion 
i believe that abortion clinics should not be government funded or taxpayer funded 
i suppose if my opponent wishes to dispute it that is his her its perogative but it will not jive with my nihilist argument for me to be simultaneously arguing against rights yet claiming that certain things are objectively morally wrong 
conclusion i have blatantly wasted the time of both the reader s and of my honoured opponent 
it is a distinct individual from the mother and being a seperate individual life that is human the most logical view is that it is a human being 
 the conclusion follows from the premise and the axiom if babbies are indeed good and a fetus is a babby then it is logical to conclude that fetii r good 
arguments the argument from lack of an argument as con i am able to assume a ridiculously sceptical position as my opponent has the burden of proof 
direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law since this does not appear to reserve first round for acceptance alone i will attempt to counter my opponents arguments 
 arguments based on moral grounds are acceptable when it comes to this topic 
the first statement is axiomatic in it is veracity there are few who would claim that babbies r not good 
since you need to affirm the claim that a woman has a right to an abortion 
any and all arguments based on moral grounds are unacceptable when it comes to this topic 
voting for a sexist is prima facie immoral thus you must vote for me if my opponent contends this 
such acts are not safe people have the knowledge it is not safe and yet continue to do it anyway just as they would with drugs or smoking 
after all only  of abortions are for the health of the mother  such a thing would negate that notion of killing unborn children to keep us in population check so to speak 
I would like to think nobody gets an abortion from somebody who is doing it in secret because what they are doing is illegal 
but much of her argument hinges on those that face complications of those who are pregnant we musn t forget that just like having a child or an std death is one of the adverse side effects for those who become pregnant 
just like with drugs people know the consequences of having a back alley abortion 
one of the main problems with outlawing abortion is the use of unsafe back alley abortions 
as my opponent said herself in round  the fetus is in fact is a life 
  if a murderer killed his pregnant wife and provided more than enough evidence that she and she alone was going to have an abortion would the judge and jury simply nod their heads and say well if she was going to abort the child anyways 
writing them off on something as simple as whether or not they can feel pain or survive by themselves is not a good measure of human status 
any human fetus on the other hand has about a  chance of growing to become a human being like you or i if you could show me such positive evidence that an insect had the potential to become a rational emotional thoughtful and intelligent human being you can bet i would not step on it 
the simplest way to answer this entire question is to show the fact that the murder of a pregnant woman is two counts of homicide 
pregnancy can be potentially dangerous and it is safe to assume that most people know this 
the amount of days or weeks at which an unborn baby can feel this that or the other is irrelevant 
when taken off their tubes and life support they too can die 
considering that your life is merely an extension of the one inside your mothers womb does not your life still have that same worth 
perhaps for the sake of your own mother but it does not mean your life is worth less or nothing at all 
your lifes value does not drop to zero based solely on the fact that you were not intended 
also when you state is the negative affect of the rape 
she could experience those physcological problems on top of the ones she could be having from pas 
i mean sure the child would be heart broken but since he she was born proves that his mother cared about s he 
when symptoms start occurring she tells herself that it is not the abortion causing them 
granted a baby cost a lot as well but the women or couple since there is another part here should have been more responsible 
the women also might get an infection from dirty tools or from fetal parts mistakenly left inside 
if the women is victim to pas or any number of physical damage they may need to be hospitalized 
the last damage i gave was scarring of the uterus lining 
this may because problems having birth in the future and may induce miscarriages 
also in a  study  of women claimed to have some pain after an abortion 
pro has essentially conceded the last  rounds and given the balance of evidence in the prior rounds it is pretty clear that she has given up on the debate 
unfortunately given that i dismantled pros affirmative position and rebutted every criticism pro raised to my own affirmative case against the permissibility of abortion in the last round i have nothing left to respond to 
it seems to me that a pretty strong case can be given for such a position even if i still think it is ultimately flawed although pro s presentation of this argument is unnecessarily weak 
pro s first criticism is that her  possibilities for the wrongness of killing inflicted pain objecting to death harm to loved ones were not to be taken as exhaustive 
pro simply does not engage at all with the main features of the argument marquis  examples plus my additional  cases the desire account or the flo account for the wrongness of killing 
as for the case against abortion I would ask pro to actually get involved and engage with the argument at hand flo rather than rely on the ultra concise general and transparently superficial assertions offered thus far 
even if it were the case that following thomson one could unplug from the unborn such a position is practically useless for abortion choice given that the vast vast majority of abortion methods directly attack the body of the human foetus  
using philosopher don marquis examples as well as others i examined pro s possible explanations for this general account and found  of them to be ably dismissed with trivial ease 
however i do not want to rely on the fallibility of pro s presentation so let us suppose a good case for bodily rights had been made 
as for pro s insistence that sentience is relevant to the right to life without an argument such a claim is obviously question begging 
foetal bodily rights given I have already shown pro s denial of foetal bodily autonomy to be nonsense I will proceed as such 
pro s only remaining viable account pro was deemed hopelessly flawed by working through cases a e 
if a foetus can not feel pain does not object to death or does not have loved ones i could respond as pro does that pro s conditions are just some of the harms that come from killing and 
as such not only has pro effectively dropped an argument she gave in defence of abortion but my argument stands almost entirely unscathed 
pro then asserts that killing is wrong not due to the harm it causes the victim but because of the malicious intent of the would be murderer 
i include it however because any general account for the wrongness of killing will have something to say about case a the challenge this argument proposes for pro and myself is to provide a general account for the wrongness of killing with respect to b e that supports our view of case a in other words both pro and i must give an account of the wrongness of killing which can satisfy the  examples that i assume we would agree each has a right to life i e not to be killed and preserve our view of case a any view which fails this task simply cannot be a general account for the wrongness of killing 
if pro wants to deny that she has to account for cases b e she will have to present an argument to defend such a view as killing in these cases is clearly prima facie morally wrong 
in other words if killing can be wrong for numerous reasons pro has to exhaust avenues to show that none of these apply to case a any general account of b e which could then apply to case a provide a potential defeater for pro s view giving she seeks to exclude the unborn from the right to life 
since the reason that is sufficient to explain why it is wrong to kill human beings after the time of birth is a reason that also applies to fetuses it follows that abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong 
finally note that while i merely have to provide a sufficient condition for the wrongness of killing for cases a e pro must provide an account which is necessary 
given that pro s only surviving justification is one of desiring to live or objecting to death and given that a teen in such a state would momentarily desire to die it seems that murder in this instance would be permissible on pro s account 
plenty of victims do not experience this yet it is obviously wrong to kill them 
in terms of desires it would seem that infants only exhibit them insofar as a foetus doe either implicitly or not at all 
again a general account for the wrongness of killing can not be so precarious as to demand a third party be wronged so this point is easily swept aside 
  given that flo account can address all the relevant examples and support my view in the contentious issue case a while pro s case is hugely defective it follows that abortion is generally morally impermissible 
conclusion i want to close with the words of moral philosopher rosalind hursthouse who perfectly captures the profound nature of the issue to think of abortion as nothing but the killing of something that does not matter 
it is obvious that this same reasoning would extend the right to life to my buddhist and alien example on similar grounds 
I am not arguing that a foetus has the right to life because of its potential to become a person 
given that this is my first debating round I will leave pro s affirmative argument for abortion the case of bodily rights to the next round 
harm to loved ones of the victim it is trivially easy to undermine the first condition 
however i will have to engage with his first argument regarding the morality of killing in this round as it directly challenges my case for the moral impermissibility of abortion 
death robs the victim of their most basic desire to continue living in the most egregious way possible therefore it is prima facie wrong 
debate frameworkit seems to me that pros use of implies that the main concern for both of us should be the moral implications of our views 
I have actually been wanting to debate abortion again for a while so it is great to get this opportunity 
as such the focus of the debate per pros insistence will be primarily on its general use and not on extreme cases like anencephaly and so on 
am i not right when i say something has to have a heart beat for it to be alive  
what would happen if you had been aborted    
you can get an abortion if it is not  mounths heart beat age  
abortion should be illegal 
but let us say the mans choice is to terminate and the womans choice is to keep 
should the woman go through with an abortion or can the man wave parental and financial responsibility 
i think that abortion is cruel as it is cheating a person out of life 
also if a person even a fetus or an embryo has a name than it they would probably be considered to important to be killed 
abortion is the reason that there are not enough women in china 
abortion also affects many different countries in the same way 
so in conclusion things pro needs to answer at what stage does it become murder to kill a fetus 
is the fetus any less alive than it was the day before seeing that pro has already conceded the fact that life begins at conception while i concede that life does begin at conception life is not equal to human life how is it not pro was once a fetus and has not got more or less alive 
and lastly if the fetus is not human pro is a fetus outside the womb and so am i by pros reasoning so is it moral to kill a baby  minutes before it is born no what about a month before that no you study the stages and draw the line where it is human or not and if you were dying and on life support you would not be living independently would that mean your not human because your not living indepinley on no point has pro proven his claims only reasons to abort the baby for all of his modern medical research it is hard to argue with stats but he did not give any 
pro asks con for evidence on why fetus equals human life well i assume pro was once a fetus and never stopped being human offspring and has just grown a bit 
the fetus is human and in fact alive and not impossible to prove as pro states because I am alive and kicking and human from the start and did not change to being a human 
on the off chance that your ability to listen to reasoned is not impaired debate i will recommend some links to some videos that might help to change your opinion to your point about fetuses not being human two human people had sexual intercourse to produce this child so it would be denying a science fact that this is not human offspring this is a quote from your last post on this debate while i concede that life does begin at conception life is not equal to human life 
this is a quote from you this is your definition of a man woman or child of the species homo sapiens distinguished from other animals by superior mental development power of articulate speech and upright stance 
while i concede that life does begin at conception life is not equal to human life this is a quote from your last post which completely destroys your own argument 
my position on this particular subject is no matter what happened no matter what you are going through even if the baby is going to wreak your short term life you can not bring a baby back from the dead when it is convenient the baby does not deserve to die because its mother got raped or went to that wild party and in the small chance of teen pregnancy i do not think that teens should be pregnant but once they get pregnant they should have to give birth of course with assistance i can not think of any argument that excuses the right to live because of someones personal convenience issues 
 since life begins at conception abortion is akin to murder as it is the act of taking human life 
 million american families wanting to adopt a child there is no such thing as an unwanted child a good society can survive people doing immoral things but a good society can not survive when people call immoral things moral 
finally I would like to point out that the overwhelming majority of abortions are due to convenience rather than necessity 
but if a woman is raped rather than responding to violence with more violence we should work to help the woman get through such a traumatising experience rather than acting like it did not happen 
the fetus simply is growing inside of the woman not like a parasite but in the womb the way they are biologically designed to 
and a  year old cannot reproduce but i think we can agree that they are alive 
by teaching teens to be responsible to be careful and to think about making any decisions that could result in a pregnancy we can lower the rate 
the murder of a pregnant woman can be counted as a double homicide yet an abortion of the same child would be considered fine 
many statistics fight the number as   to   annually even though that number was revealed to be false by dr 
finally i would like to say that our society already considers the unborn to be persons 
and yes women should be able to control their bodies although i did mention before that no one is allowed complete bodily autonomy but a fetus is not part of the womans body 
I am sure you would agree that pregnant women do not have four arms and legs or two sets of internal organs 
the illegal abortion was an interesting point but the unsafe abortions occur primarily in countries that do not have advanced medical technology 
being pregnant is not a punishment for having sex it is simply to result of an action that was designed purely for that purpose 
according to mary calderone who was a president of planned parenthood only  people died in  due to any kind of abortion 
we know as well that a fetus can respond to stimuli and a fetus grows to its environment an adapts during birth to a new environment

its not good to pro i am of the above topic of debate 
a fetus is not an egg 
is an infant aware the same way you are aware 
is it aware of emotions like sorrow and grief 
does it know what year it is 
you should be a nice person to other people if you are supporting people to kill someone nside of you you are a monster 
look people i do not even get why you should be killing people inside of you 
unborn babies are still babies 
abortion is murder because scientifically these unborn babies are every bit alive they would be alive if they were prematurely born 
so take a side with me and say no to abortion 
so take a side with me and say no to abortion 
abortion can also be dangerous for mothers because there is a chance the doctor will mess it up and the mother would be harmed 
i hope that you will reconsider your standpoint for anyone that believes it is okay thank you for a good debate and please vote for the negative 
i would also like to point out that my opponent has not actually made a case for abortion but merely stated that abortion is better 
the real premise that all my arguments come down to is a living being is not anything else while it is in development 
but even then it is still a human it does not become a human after the premature period of development is done it is a human the whole time 
so year do not mess with me or me ideas cus there like so totally righ 
I am like so totasly hot right now i could just go to yow house and put my waste ina yo mumma 
an hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down but it is not this day 
by all that you hold dear on this good earth i bid you stand men of the west 
a day may come when the courage of men fails when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship but it is not this day 
same to you 
yeah i guess you are right 
i guess you did technically answer the question of whether abortion is murder or not but that still does not prove that abortion is  okay 
if you ask me denying life without consent in any way is murder 
abortion is always wrong because it takes a life a life that no one has the right to take 
adoption allows the mother to not have to raise a child and she would not have to carry the guilt of killing a baby for the rest of her life 
pro believes the choice to carry the baby for  months is better than killing a innocent life which is evil and irresponsible 
so con says that it is right to kill someone if they interfere with your life 
the mother can always give the baby up for adoption after birth 
imagine that a mother gives her  month old baby a drug so that the baby could not feel pain 
but i pro believe we should not punish a innocent baby for what it is father has done 
after the mother kills the baby she says that it could not feel pain since it could not feel pain it is nothing wrong with killing the baby 
con pointed out that if a woman has been raped she does not have to have the fathers permission to abort 
if you believe that the unborn baby is living off the mother you are correct 
after she kills the child she says she had the right to kill it because it could not feel pain and that it was her body even though it was not this is the same thing that is anyone that aborts a baby under  weeks is doing 
after  weeks the baby can feel pain this is confirmed by scientific studies the studies also say that the fetus may can feel pain more intense than after being born 
this is my argument of why we should not abort babies that may not can feel pain 
i disagree anesthetics may be given to the fetus but i believe it would not block the pain of being destroyed 
that a mother has the right to kill her baby even if it causes extreme pain to thebaby 
so science says that the baby in the womb can feel pain has a beating heart  months after conception looks like a baby so the fact is 
we all agree that a parent murdering their  year old is wrong and evil since the unborn is just as human as a  year old it is indeed just as wrong 
it would be sensible to say that abortion is the same as a person killing their  year old baby 
i believe abortion at anytime in a pregnancy is wrong and should be illegal 
although i do not have time to supply evidence to this claim i can supply it next time as i know many examples of this happening but this consent argument is very strong the only problem is people on both parties often consent but then regret their decision later 
i will not bother responding to the rest of this point as i am pretty sure it is entirely based on who can win the second point please correct me if i am wrong 
while you use a very philosophical argument i would like to use science and then explain why your argument is not as credible 
if you do not think human life exists at fertilization please tell me where you think it begins and why 
there is no point in spending too much time on this as this point depends almost entirely on your second point so I will make it brief 
i also agree with your pre rebuttal both parties do have to have consent but sometimes the opportunity in the abortion industry does lure in doctors who later regret their decisions 
this is a very flawed analogy as it would mean people in comas are dead as well as people suffering from severe types of brain damage among many others 
there might be exceptions that are okay like rape or to save the mom but they are in the far minority so on balance it is better to put abortion in the wrong category 
later term there is no question you are killing a baby 
even if it was not a person it is still harming ones self and a living entity that is of human nature 
i personally say abortion should be legal but not punished before the point of fetal pain 
well i was expacting a reply but it looks like i got none 
in fact there are people i know who have had abortions and i do not love them any less for it but when it comes right down to it it is still murder and weather you accept it or not it will not change the facts 
 I would like to restate the fact that i hate abortion but if a woman was contemplating it then she should at least consult her partner first it would be messdup not to 
though i am not christian i respect and honor the christian beliefs and though i may not agree with all the catholic beliefs i do believe that abortion is wrong murder and whatever else you would like th call it but one thing is for sure it is not right 
that is like you and your girlfriend both bought a kitten together and she one day decides that she does not want it and kills it 
i mean come on what the hell would france be without the maid of lorane now do not get me wrong because i know I am kinda pushin the envelope a bit but you can understand my point right 
i believe its the womens choice to have a baby and abortion is not murder first of all I would like to state that it is not the right or desicion of the parents to decide wheather or not the the child of another lives or dies wheather that person is their child or not 
though i can never imagine the feeling that a pregnant woman has i can imagine its not that pleasant but I am more then sure that there are women who have been raped but still had their child 
abortion is something that only people of the  and  century have known but sexual assult has been going on forever 
rather then boil a culdron full of water once a month we can just hop in the shower every night and rather then have our children like real men and women like our ansestors we can just abort them 
now this is a pretty f dup scenario but that still does not make abortion right 
the only reason we can not handle things like this today is because we do not have to 
constitutionality it is important to note that there is no right to an abortion anywhere in the constitution but there is an explicit right to life which can not be deprived without due process of law 
adult stem cellsit is true i did not rebuttal this un sourced point and it was because this point is irrelevant to the issue if abortion is ok just like saying we could mine the earth for coal but that is irrelevant to is mining ok 
hopefully to all those reading this debate will see how my opponent failed to argue and defend the position that the unborn were not human or not living therefore the unborn are living humans and deserve the equal protection for the right to life 
or if you disagree with public nudity do not get nude in public do not stop someone else i am not forcing anyone to get nude in public it should be the persons choice 
poor quality of lifemy opponent says well if the child is on the streets being too cold or too hot always wondering where your next meal would come from 
adoptionthat is all stuff that could happen but being adopted could benefit them by helping others find foster parents such as the case with dave thomas the founder of wendys 
orif you disagree with gun ownership do not get an gun do not stop someone else i am not forcing anyone to get an gun it should be the persons choice 
two my argument was comparing situations in which people choose for others such as killing an unborn due to poverty and killing a born due to poverty 
body autonomymy opponents has a strange claim here 
my opponent claims the spectrum argument is irrelevant because a child has the right to choose once they are born 
if you think this reasoning is valid then anything else that could be filled in there would be valid 
adult stem cellsonce again this argument comes back to if the unborn are living so i end this argument since it is not central to the question at hand whether abortion is ok but rather it is a result because if abortion is ok then fetal stem cells are fine to use 
i would like to ask how not giving the death penalty to them is a punishment and is terminating their life a reward 
firstly i never said the only question is if unborn fetuses are human but rather i said and i explained why this is true 
this just proves murder is illegal which i think we both agree is good that it is illegal but this does nothing to the central question if the unborn are living humans 
according to this logic a three year old would not be living either since it also can not reproduce 
however if abortion is not ok then fetal stem cells are not fine to use 
however i doubt anyone thinks a three year old is not living 
so if overpopulation makes abortion ok then with the same reasoning it would make genocide ok 
i did not include maternal health or protection of the innocent because we agreed on those points 
and it makes it clear in exodus    where it states if people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury the offender must be fined whatever the woman s husband demands and the court allows 
there is also a reference to the unborn in psalm   where it talks about seeing an unformed body 
if a problem arises such as a cancerous uterus then actions should be taken to eliminate the medical problem and if it results in the death of the unborn then it is tragic but it is not an abortion 
well i would like to point out that the phrase is not in the constitution but rather it is in the declaration of independence so this is not even a valid reason to rebuttal 
argument  abortion could save the life of the parent 
the unborn will try to achieve internal balance but it might be unstable but the process of stabilization is homeostasis which is there just like it is in each of the living cells that make up the unborn 
first my opponent claims since the early life can not survive outside of the womb makes in not a life 
let me ask this question should we allow the parent of a born human who was conceived in rape to kill their born child 
second should parents be able to kill their born children because they can not afford to take care of them 
at least adoption offers a chance for the person to have a life while abortion will make sure there is no chance for them 
with this proper understanding of what life it we can conclude that the unborn are living 
it is important to note that the true question here is are the unborn human because if they are not then they do not get human rights and abortion should be legal but if they are human then they deserve the human right to life like every other human 
to be murdered the unborn must first be alive which was confirmed in the last paragraph and must be human which is what i will cover here 
I am not entirely pro choice but i do believe that the mother has a right to decide who lives if her life is in danger 
i think abortion can help certian people out as many women in ledcs need to get an abortion to preserve their quality of life 
well abortion can kill many babies 
i would argue for the childs in this case seeing as the mother has already lived and experienced life where as the baby did not even get that chance baby from beginning if you do not know this already you can research this 
the law prevents child abuse and just because the parents did not want the child and abuse him her does not mean that its right 
but that should not suggest that someone else can not care for the child 
when it comes down to abortion or the mothers life it is really just a matter of opinion of who is life would be more important in the situation 
to not let that child live because of his her fathers wrong doing 
noot that every persons decision is what should matter 
but at least he got to take the chance and let nature decide whether that child would die or not 
that is what i meant when i said the mother can survive  months of emotional turmoil 
sexually abused child again this is where adoption comes in 
this debate has been really fun thankyou for accepting it 
child abuse again as i have stated in the previous round abusive parenting is not an issue with abortion either 
the baby had that oppurtunity at having a life the second the mother was pregnant 
my opponent is saying that it is better just to let the child die than taking that  chance 
i know it was not the mother fault that she is pregnant 
what you are referring to in this case is what is called a a stillborn is a child who does not take in its surroundings or its life in any way 
and if the child dies the child dies and there is nothing anyone can do about it 
so is killing a child based off an indefinite source the right thing to do in this case 
and the child life is not going to be dramatically challenged to the point the death would be the answer 
it does not get a choice on whether it lives or dies and unlike the mother it does not get the chance to even attempt to live it is life 
either way it would not be right to end the innocent childs life 
but to instantly jump to the conclusion that the childs death is the first priority to everyone 
abusive parenting i have argued this previously above in answer to your story obiously if most people would say yes and affirm then that is the the correct thing to do 
she does not want to take responsibility of the child 
is it easier to murder a potential life then to just wait out the nine long hard months 
as if the child would be trying to commit suicide just to preserve his emotions 
if that is the case then why not just kill everyone out on the streets who is living a healthy life 
if they know they can not take care of the child but however do anyway that would be saved for an argument on parental responsibility not abortion 
but there is the chance of it going possitively as well 
they can give you results leading to the probabability of death even a high one at that 
she still to the risk to have the child and it should now be her responsibility to carry out her action 
she is now going to have to take responsibility of what she brought into life 
on several occasions i am sure death was a big issue for him 
but because they are is the liklihood of it going bad that means we should take it away from them 
yes i am sure the question would arise to the child about there parents reasoning for leaving them behind 
yes the child may die given certain circumstances but then there would not be any more level of grief for the child than already attained 
i would argue more on the subject but i am just about out of remaining characters so for this round i would like to leave any viewers with this simple knowledge 
yes it is miserable but applies in no way to the childs desicion 
this applies to the same aspect of the child life or death being at risk when birth 
but either way this boy found a loving and peaceful family to take care of him 
if that is the case then us as people need to notice the flaw in ourselves 
i hold to my argument about the sickness 
denying the child that privilige no not privilige a better word for that would be freedom would be unjust and wrong 
if your not even going to give the child a chance to live you can pre judge what his her life will be like 
 first we have a mother who is dying of cancer and the only way to save her is to kill the child 
he she is still a living being and has potential to life and denying them the privilige of life would be cruel just because they have an extra chromosome 
so are you saying that all mentally hadicapped people on the earth do not have a right to live 
first of all she has cancer and there is the likliness of her dying anyway 
i am against abortion because if a man is drunk and he drove and ran a stop light and hit a pregnant woman he would get charged for two murders but if a woman gets pregnant and chooses to not have that child she does not get charged with a murder and it is her fault if she gets pregnant but there is a flaw here is she gets raped then she could have the child but put it in a orphanage rather than not letting the kid have a chance to cure cancer or aids or other diseases like that 
murder the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another 
pregnant having a child or young developing in the uterus 
i know you are not advocating it but that would be the next logical progression since once we are allowed to chose the gender why not the eye colour and skin colour 
this is a collective group the status will not increase if they arbitrarily demand an increased status 
 do you seriously believe that there will be so many successful rapes women who will get pregnant choose to give birth to the child fathers and mothers who will not look after the child to the point that there will be an increase in poor people 
 south korea is the only country that equalized its male female ratio and it was a country that legalized ssa and enforced it vigorously 
my opponent does not seem to think this is a problem however for me it would be then we would ask for illegalizing ssa making it pretty useless to legalize it in the first place 
there are so many factors that shape the decision that one or two of the points in the checklist are bound to be overlooked 
applying the same logic to women the fallacy would be that though women would gain importance they would be targeted when they are not strong 
the societal structure would shift making this pretty common and as a result though no one is stopping them the need would reduce further 
once ssa is legalized the clinics will start publicizing it and try to play on the insecurity of the populace and emphasize on the illogicity of having a girl when you can have a boy 
they would be pushed in the trade when young and by the time they gain sense either they would like the life or they would be too addicted to drugs and all to get out of it 
an unhealthy trend also i addressed every claim of my opponent and provided sound sources to back up my rebuttals and claims 
 if they can find a mate it will be in their interest the principle is similar to respecting other people s right to life to not perform rapes 
during marriage asking whether the family allows ssa cannot be the deciding factor because as can be quite obvious in any searching for the boy process compromise is accepted 
to which i responded that this would not be sustainable because of increase in illegitimate children 
the fisher s principle is not valid over here because it argues that increased mating prospects will translate to better status whereas as i have argued it will lead to declining status because of the increased crimes against women and because of increased pressure on them to get married 
 alright better mating prospects will only result in an increased status if women utilize better mating prospects to demand an increased status 
 caste consideration of the male would not matter since females would have plenty of choice from their own caste 
 i know abortion is legal but it is legal when the fetus is a danger to the woman or has a high probability of being profoundly handicapped 
 caste considerations would become irrelevant when compared to not getting a mate at all 
the medical termination of pregnancy act  permits abortion to be performed only when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health or when there is a substantial risk of the child being born with physical or mental abnormalities so as to be seriously handicapped 
it is legal only when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health or when there is a substantial risk of the child being born with physical or mental abnormalities so as to be seriously handicapped 
increased pressure to marry the society as a whole adjusts to the conditions following every change 
it will reinforce the gender prejudices and people would cash in on these and there would be no way for the government to check these because they would not breaking any law 
any law which legalizes ssa must take care to ensure that there is explicit consent of the woman 
the reason why the woman opting for ssa should not be allowed was stated as freedom of choice should not be executed when it harms someone and that it makes the love for the child conditional 
wars yes the mating prospects would increase but that would not lead to an increase in status instead it will result in declining status which is what i predicted in the previous argument since there would be a simultaneous increase in the pressure to marry coupled with decreasing demographic representation 
once a girl is married into the family the respect is uniform 
a parent who perfects his child is bound to show a greater control and expect a lot more from his child putting him under undue pressure 
the status would not increase instead a steady decline in the role of the wife would start 
with a large number of males as compared to females the pressure would translate into a societal norm 
 this statement is misleading though this does not affect the argument that much the circumstances were the reasons that created a pressing demand for illegalizing ssa 
i do not see a drastic change in the amount of respect given to a wife no matter the ratio of males to females 
i e it does not allow the parent to discard the child as long as it does not infringe on the personal health of the mother or the child 
the divide between rich and poor would increase can you explain this 
and during a time when there would be even more demand for the services the prostitution market would flourish 
 since the presence of a woman will improve the status of a household she will become an asset which will be protected even more than now by the family 
the argument pointed out that the social structure of india is not favourable for legalizing ssa 
the men might be more willing but the women holding the right to mate would have pretty large choice from the male members of the same caste 
let us look at the effects of an imbalanced sex ratio  reduction in poverty ummm you are assuming that the men will be okay with having no children 
the population growth may decrease but the increase in illegitimate children is going to be a major problem 
in fact this is going to worsen the situation since there will be an increase in female trafficking rape cases will increase 
the forum against sex determination and sex pre selection fasdsp was formed in bombay in october  its members were from varied backgrounds feminists health and human rights activists persons involved in the peoples science movement etc 
we can take the example of south korea south korea is the only country that equalized its male female ratio and it was a country that legalized ssa and enforced it vigorously 
 the introduction of the bill added an entirely different dimension to the campaign and forced the state government to give serious consideration to the issue 
the assumption in the argument reverberates the common mentality of demonizing those who opt for ssa 
saying that it was for the people to change their attitude to female children 
the state governments having realized that there was no legal provision to back such action also remained inactive 
one copy of the handbill reached the centre for womens development studies cvids in the summer of  
the district medical officer amritsar interpreted this statement at its face value and threatened the management of the new bhandaris clinic with legal action 
at least given the law the practice is under wraps and there is a certain taboo in the practice 
 the rebuttal to your claim that skewed sex ratio is going to increase women s position has been addressed at the appropriate place 
  stabilization of population extending the previous argument maybe the traditional families would decrease but we cannot ignore the desperation of poor male members unable to find themselves a bride 
for women the deficit situation may not improve their status at all despite what a rudimentary economic model would have us believe 
scarcity of women would not enhance their position in society due to the simultaneous increase in pressure to marry higher risk of gender based violence rising demand for sex work and the development of trafficking networks 
 greater crimes legalising ssa will almost certainly lead to a skewed sex ratio which would lead to greater prostitution rackets kidnapping sexual violence as is seen in china and india already 
it is not more than advice 
the moral question remains though as a private problem for the woman and these sorts of private moral dilemmas are the province of religion 
she may see it as her duty to protect it despite the obvious disadvantages to her personal circumstances and she may choose against abortion for those reasons 
if the woman is christian she may see her foetus as a living child 
you seemed to just be having a sort of rant make sure you say things like now on to the points  
 not good good luck in your future debate and i hope you pass your class  
you absolutely need to use sources and not just let them do the work for you 
it is not there is no other evidence that abortion promotes a culture in witch human life is disposable  
again  com is not a unbiased etc etcthis is the hippocratic oath as reproduced by the webpage here for amusement purposes i will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it nor will i make a suggestion to this effect 
 the study again says the classification of other than direct maternal deaths was ambiguous meaning the assertion of abortion leads to suicide by this website by its own evidence is disprovennote the study in question is a good piece of scientific work and i am not attempting to diss or otherwise demean its methodology simply that the argument made by the website is invalid 
the modern version contains the phrase but it may also be within my power to take a life this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty 
this is a very small sample size and as such is not very good to back up such a sweeping statement as abortion kills made by the website  
however as i stated above this is not a life that we are taking and con pro 
if con pro does not rebut them next round this debate should be considered an autowin for me 
this is a perfect example of the fallacy of authority assuming something must be correct because it is said by an authority figure in this case the pope 
 I would like to know just why the website thinks that the original version is in any way better than the modern version which is now taken by all doctors 
while it is true that the spinal cord is important to the nervous system it is not an end in and of itself 
 weeks which is the standard almost globally is well short of that meaning that according to our current science the fetus does not feel pain thus refuting a common argument that of the fetus feeling pain  my body my choice the fetus is completely dependent upon the mother while in the womb for its nutrition etc 
 while you are reading this a child is dying because of an adults ignorance 
let us start with some definitions 
however it goes on to say that the pain receptors are not connected to the brain until   weeks 
this means that the fetus can be considered a part of a mothers body 
nathans an early proponent became a pro life campaigner after he saw a  week old fetus scream during an abortion 
i fail to see how this is relevant to your case and these figures should they actually be true are actively harmful as they suggest a very small minority of abortions are after  weeks 
anyhow for those who are too lazy to read it it says in essence that at  weeks pain receptors are widespread and therefore the fetus feels pain possibly at that point 
 by  weeks a fetus has formed a spine which means the fetus can feel pain 
we give freedom in our society for people to do what they want with their body generally 
one of the most important reasons abortion should be illegal beyond the fact that it terminates life is that most women have regret and life complications due to this action 
these actions result in distress for not only the pregnant woman but also her family 
in addition the responsibility a woman takes for deciding life or death of a baby remains unethical and mentally devastating no matter what type of upbringing she had 
there are many reasons abortion should be illegal including the descriptive and disturbing stories about how aborted babies sometime scream as they come out and the looks of pain on their faces 
god blesses people in unexpected ways however trusting that he is in control further supports and gives confidence to the woman who chooses life 
though it is easy to envision lower class minority women filling the statistics of abortion studies show that the majority of women succeeding in this action are in the upper class population 
empowering women concerning how to take care of as well conduct themselves in order to minimize incident lowers the statistics of rape thus lowering statistics of abortion 
understanding that god makes no mistakes and plants the seed of a child can further influence a woman toward life even if she decides on adoption 
in addition to complications after the procedure a woman runs a high risk of death during the procedure which increases based on how far along she is in the pregnancy 
this controversy will remain for centuries however the fact that a potential life has ended before given a chance remains evidence enough for most people to understand why a person should never have a choice of whether a baby lives or dies 
the seed that god plants should never be taken for granted or misused 
 as clinton wilcox a ddo member keytar hero writes on his blog human beings are uniquely valuable based on the kind of thing they are humans that is members of species homo sapiens 
although his argument will be responded to i would ask voters to put more of a weight on moral arguments in this case his first trimester point and my case will be mainly ethics 
one famous abortionist who works in my town side note his wife is being sued because one of her abortion patients died has admitted all late and second trimester abortions will likely experience one complication 
and instead of giving a personal experience with a child that was like this i will give an empirical point as personal stories are not always  accurate many parents have aborted their babies because doctors told them that their children would be severely handicapped 
if the right to life is proven as i will prove in my case rape should be no exception to abortion 
my opponent under contraception has essentially argued killing a human is moral because a woman has made careless mistakes  
the amount of parents owning an adopted child was cut in half after roe v wade not because of parents not wanting children but there not being enough children 
my opponents second point arguing a fetus is not developed enough to be a person but is a human shall also be refuted in my case 
war should only be perused if there is no other option my opponents analogy actually proves my point that abortion should be a restricted procedure 
this argument will be refuted in my case 
the largest most credible studies have shows  of women with an abortion have post abortion syndrome 
i would like to first note the majority of his argument is irrelevant it argues for the practicality of abortion not the ethics 
abortion kills a human being as naral an abortion advocacy group admits there is simply no doubt that even the early embryo is a human being 
as to being there is no doubt that it exists is alive is self directed and is not the same being as the mother and is therefore a unified whole 
we are the only beings that we know of that are inherently rational agents killing such a life form would be immoral and therefore wrong 
the burden of proof must always be on the one wishing to take human life 
further the roe v wade court case was not founded on the constitution they merely assumed it a  amendment right which is debateable 
i see that but if they are not ready then they could use condoms spermacide and even birth control 
there are many mothers that want a baby but can not have one and there are mothers who are whores and can have them but are to lazy to fill out the paper work to give it up for adoption so they just kill the baby 
they could have prevented the baby they were just stupid and did not think about the consequence of their actions just like little kids 
i am glad that you agree 
if a female wants to change her mind about birthing another human then so be it especially if the circumstances are not fair 
babies are being torn to pieces stabbed in the heart with a poison needle or suffocated in the name of choice 
elective abortion is any abortion done not for medical necessity 
i will let the pro start us off 
while pro thinks that good government policy should take into account the economy personal liberty and quality of life it must be remembered that con shares those ideas 
again i claim that third trimester abortions should be illegal in the united states assuming development within normal parameters unless the life of the mother was at stake 
if this value was lost or even demoted it would easily and logically lead to a slippery slope of questioning other fundamental ethics such as the respect to children and babies i e following the event of birth 
essentially if it were alright to kill a fetus in the third trimester both of us agreeing it has the attribute of sentience assuming development within normal parameters then logically nothing would be wrong with infanticide 
there is one distinct reason that can be deduced as to why the value of sentient life largely dominates other values in decision making ultimately leading to con winning this debate if our society were to demote the intrinsic value of sentient life from decision making chaos would readily follow 
con claims that the value of sentient life largely dominates other values in decision making while pro claims the contrary 
first of all just as a point of reference many debate whether or not sentience is measured on a scale or if it is indeed a black and white issue 
by the killing of a third trimester fetus with sentience it permits the killing of other sentient beings 
i was merely stating in my round  that it is more ethical to allow the parasite to die by default 
however it is in the power of the united states to allow all pregnant chinese women to come into the united states 
if you look at my profile however you will see that i am against vegetarianism peta 
the fundamental respect to sentient life must always be intact in order to preserve all of the other values our society holds today 
i will not use the term of human life necessarily but instead talk about the value in which life is placed in society at the current time 
rebuttal  again i have postulated that the greatest overall value that is held by our society as a whole today is the fundamental respect to sentient life 
i am postulating that the fundamental respect to sentient life is the overall most imperative value our society has today 
what good would economic values and personal liberties be if our society lost its fundamental value holding it together 
 if our government wanted to protect life then it should ban the use of automobiles 
as mentioned a good national policy should deal with what our collective society in the united states can deduce is more important and therefore values more 
i am arguing that the fundamental value that is holding our society together is the essential respect to sentient life 
but if i told everyone we should ban automobiles to preserve the lives of innocent pedestrians you would call me insane 
i guess that is the debate over then 
i would prefer to win the battle of ideas not the battle of government force as this is both more moral according to me and would lead to a much longer enduring outcome 
here are some basic reasons why i support the legalisation of abortion while not supporting the practice in any way i want to avoid back ally abortions which are considerably more likely to because serious harm or death to the mother 
post script i should add that it is somewhat strange to see a so called libertarian proposing fascist regulations on what women can or cannot do with their own bodies 
no child deserves to die can feel or can t feel brought through force and pain or not all deserve to live 
welcome to the site i look forward to an interesting and stimulating debate 
 merriam webster now as my first point i will start out in saying that i think the biggest issue that and believers have is when life begins 
I am sorry that this is not traditional debating style my thoughts tend to get scattered i look forward to your reply and feel free to bring up any points you would like me to comment on 
life begins when the sperm and the egg are joined to form a potential child 
the first round will only be for acceptance and small introductions 
the first round will be for short introductions and acceptance i can not wait to see what you have to say 
obviously when the babys brain starts developing is important to you so allow me to share a fact a babys brain spinal cord and other vital organs begin forming at week  of the pregnancy 
answering your question again the fetus begins forming it is brain at week  some facts norma mcorvey from the roe v wade trial is a pro life advocate 
abortion is an easy way out it is by no means responsible to end a child life to make yours easier 
if you do not think you can love and care for your child the way you should let another set of parents who desperately want a child 
so do you think a  year old should have the right to get an abortion without parental consent 
 now i myself am against the death penalty but i do understand the argument and i would love to get into that a different time 
p s if you have never seen pictures of an aborted baby i would advise you to although it is graphic and gruesome you can clearly see developed hands and feet 
putting a scientific term helps make the situation easier because your not ending a babies life you are terminating a fetus which has no value 
in the same way most pro choice liberals are against the choice of being able to own a gun and all that entails 
to say they are against is a bit ignorant because they are not specifically against all those things 
I am sure you have heard about the gosnell case and the details are disgusting 
i think that we celebrate birthdays on the day of birth because you can not always know for sure the date of conception well a doctor can approximately and also that the day of birth is just as much a celebration for the mother as it is the child 
 merriam webster now as my first point i will start out in saying that i think the biggest issue that and believers have is when life begins 
I am sorry that this is not traditional debating style my thoughts tend to get scattered i look forward to your reply and feel free to bring up any points you would like me to comment on 
i feel that it is un educated to say that people who are against abortions and also that people who are for abortion 
if you believe like most pro choice people that life begins at birth then why are not abortions done later in the term 
life begins when the sperm and the egg are joined to form a potential child 
really i hate abortion pretty much until it comes down to the health of the mother 
that is   deaths in just one year because there parents do not want them 
in the case of rape the woman should really bare the child 
abortion is an issue because a whole kids fate is chosen by his mother 
there are quite a bit of taxes actually though it may not have been as much as discussed earlier 
you post a strong argument but the bills at the end of the month do not lie 
 might not sound like much but the government regulates about  billion dollars of taxes every month 
the order that the rights are listed in is important because they go in progression from the most fundamental 
this is a prejudice based solely on a single characteristic of the other person that attempts to dehumanize them in one fashion or another 
our system of law is also based on the existence of fundamental human rights 
the us founding fathers described these fundamental rights in the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
this is not to be confused with privileges granted by the state such as the right to drive vote etc 
one has no liberty if they do not have the right to life 
my final argument will be that the law already recognizes the responsibility of parents to provide for the needs of their children failure to provide the necessities of life everyone is under a legal duty as a parent foster parent guardian or head of a family to provide necessaries of life for a child under the age of sixteen years 
to keep things even with my worthy opponent this is his first time after all i will keep my opening statement brief as well 
 that is true but that same argument could apply to people in intensive care or more closely to comatose and hospitalized old people  well that fetus would be dead outside the mothers body anyway p but there is definitely a difference but in the long one not much since the fetus would eventually develop to be a baby  i don t really have much to say on this one just refer to   that is true this point is jut really    shelters are usually available or the government can intervene since its their job to make sure every citizen is safe trumps wall is not really realistic a fence is more likely if it actually happens 
abortion is morally wrong since it ends something that at best could have been a source of joy for those around it and possibily many other people and at worst a nuisance to society before it could even begin 
this continues until the child s entire body is removed from the womb 
you s supreme court justice kennedy describes the procedure saying the fetus in many cases dies just as a human adult or child would it bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb 
 according to these articles latest time on which a baby can feel pain is  weeks not  and that is the latest since pain can start sooner 
I am not going to advance this point further for now since you did not seem to finish your  it is fairly common sense that an unborn baby cannot survive on its own but neither can newborns very small children and very old people 
but a teenage mother who was just careless should not be able to abort her child because of her irresponsible actions she needs to learn from her mistakes the raped victim however did not do anything wrong but be at the wrong place at the wrong time 
but still then i do not agree with abortion I am just more understanding in those cases because of the emotional impact it could have on the mother and then later affect the child 
the mother may have trouble holding or giving affection to her child because the child could resemble the rapist or could be just a constant reminder of that one incident so that could because psychological issues in the child later on and may lead to them becoming violent in society 
because the unborn child is unseen it is easier for society to condone killing him or her though this is morally indistinguishable from killing any child at any stage of development 
in addition abortion does not solve the deeper problems that have contributed to having an untimely pregnancy problems such as low self esteem sexual exploitation unchaste sexual behavior poverty lack of education and absence of moral guidance 
finally a society which allows the killing of its most vulnerable members in the very place in all the world which should be for them to be safest and most nurtured their own mothers wombs is incapable of cherishing and nurturing human life or valuing childhood and motherhood 
rebutt  a fetus is not a rational or conscious agent and therefore does not hold a serious right to life 
con  in article  from the declaration of human rights it says the everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration 
 abortion is something that is routinely practiced by natural biological processes in nature but the kind of abortion in which the open your stomach and rip apart a human life is not a natural process 
by having the abortion you are taking the life of a little person that is growing inside you when the one you should be punishing is the person who commited that horrible act of rape 
for example rape victims believe their case is justified but the truth is that by having an abortion you are punishing an innocent unborn child which you could of found a nice family for him to be adopted 
they are just taking the easy way out instead of taking responsability for their act i will end this par of my argument with stating the legal principal that says 
I am using the first round to explain the debste my oponent may start with his argument or may just forfeit or say whatever he wants 
interesting that he does not even reference any of my previous examples detailing how this is not so 
my opponent has failed to give any form of argument for how sentience overrides ones right to bodily sovereignty thereby conceding it is inferior to it 
sentience does not permit one to violate bodily sovereignty this proves bodily sovereignty holds power over sentience not the other way around 
my opponent claims that bodily sovereignty cannot exist without sentience and while i agree i show how bodily sovereignty overrides ones sentience when determining morality 
so yes even without free will it still must observe the idea of bodily sovereignty because the idea is not concerning it but the mother 
they never attempt to show a situation wherein ones sentience allows one to violate anothers bodily sovereignty 
i take this as a concession to the fact that bodily sovereignty will always override sentience 
if the fetus is sentient life it is required to be held to such regulations therefore permitting abortion despite it is sentience and right to life for it has no inherent right to the mothers body it would violate her bodily sovereignty 
i agree with your claims that sentience is important to understanding bodily sovereignty but you are flawed in saying it is above such sovereignty 
if the fetus were indeed sentient life it would have no such right to the mothers body 
the problem with your proposition is that much like how being born into a country means you are to be subjected to it is laws being sentient requires you to follow certain rules 
one of those being that it has no inherent right to the mothers body because of her bodily sovereignty 
as my opponent stated they will be arguing for why the sentience or lack there of should be how we determine the morality of abortion 
ok i see what your saying that this earth is being over populated but it is still wrong one reason is that we do not own are bodies god does two god has a plan for that child for instants i read this cartoon and this man was looking at god and he asked god why have not you sent someone to cure aids and god said we have so many problems diseases and ect 
if you plan to get an abortion which is premeditated then you are by definition committing murder 
the fact that a fetus is a human being is undeniable 
the baby is not just created in a womans womb out of nothing 
conclusion if this is what you are saying then should not we be aborting almost every kid in africa at this time now that life is difficult to survive there 
you have no right in doing anything about the death penalty because you are no on death row 
anyone who has or was ever threatened by a gun are the only ones who have the right to defend gun control 
this is not really a good reason because no mother gets and abortion because she feels it is necessary to keep the earths population from getting to high 
when i see a pregnant woman i do not think she should kill it so she could 
 again as said before we have no right to say who lives and who can not 
if you can find a doctor who is able to do a legal abortion you can find someone who can take care of the kid 
again as said before we have no right in saying who lives and who can not 
you have no right in saying the holocaust was wrong because you are not jewish assuming you are not jewish 
i do want to close with this abortion is legal murder the baby has the right to live also i want to add that there are more people that apply for adoption than the amount of babies in the hospital 
a side note abortion is never necessary to save a womans life and pro choice always use the argument about rape and incest 
the unborn baby will only be there for nine months which is a short time in comparability to a lifetime marred with shame guilt and sorrow 
if a dream idea or who you are dies inside is the greatest loss then a actual human being dieing inside a person has got to be the greatest loss of all 
grown people who have lived a life and is face with a choice of how they should die is one thing and a person who never breathed a breath of life never having a choice at all are two different things 
in abortion it is not just quick and easy and it is over with the baby really experiences all of what happens to it and it is very sad 
i agree being abandoned is a very sad thing to endure but living a decent life will help that condition and one can still have a prosperous life 
but the killers in heart had a appointment of death with innocent people that day thinking they were doing something good and made some of victims make a horrible choice 
a study shows that the biggest stresses in life are death divorce and moving 
one big difference once that condition has accrued there is no life and the girl or woman will have to deal with the guilt of abandoning their morals and killing her child therefore life will be filled with shame and hurt 
may god forgive us for the she would of innocent blood 
it is better that you find out those are not your parents and live than your parents killing you and die 
for example ethel waters was born in chester pennsylvania on october   as a result of her mothers rape at age  
there is also the life of george washington carver one of the brightest american minds of the twentieth century he had a horrible start starting with being born in slavery father and family killed mother and sister kidnapped and never seen again left on the side of the road with a big brother that later died 
she never lived in the same place for more than  months 
or maybe they have a break down and their spouse divorces them and the child is teased mercilessly at school 
why not abort the  year old child who got hit by a car and became mentally I will and is now a burden after the parents lost their jobs and lost their home because of medical bills 
 in short because of her unpleasant life she inspired millions 
despite this unpromising start waters demonstrated early the love of language that so distinguishes her work 
i would agree with you about abortion is no longer applicable after  weeks but i would argue that science has proven that its unsafe in every stage for the mother as well as the baby 
first of all we do not have to take in account the state of the parents because obviously the parents of this unfortunate being did not take in account their finances lifestyle or responsibility of the consequences of their actions while they were doing their thing 
no one is guaranteed a good life whether you are rich or poor 
hi I am mariah norton I am  years old and I am against abortion because it takes away the babys right to live and should have the right to develop and live it is not just the mom body 
first of all people who are pro choice say that the baby is just a blob of cells and the mom should have the right to get an abortion because it is her body 
also people who are pro choice say that the baby can not hear or feel pain or think 
at  weeks from conception a baby can kick turn over make a fist open its mouth and press his or her lips together 
also when they a done aborting the baby they throw the skull and every thing in the garbage can and it is bloody 
first however it is imperative to come to some sort of conclusion about what an abortion actually does whether it is a termination of life or not 
levatino explains the time it takes for the type of abortion in question and says s life is seriously threatened by her pregnancy a doctor more often than not doesn t have  hours much less  hours to resolve the problem 
if a mother was incapable of taking care of her  year old son and opted to kill him she would be reviled by the entire world and taken to court for murder 
b simple reason and common sense when a doctor performs an abortion he removes the as they call it always avoiding the term and throw it away 
this patient s pregnancy was a threat to her life and the life of her unborn child 
in short though abortions both surgical and medical taking pills are prone to such side effects which could range from severe depression and abdominal pain to heart attacks strokes and in extreme cases even death 
there is a clear summary of the risks from puja lalwani writing for buzzle com however due to space constraints i cannot fit all of it into this debate 
if she is unable or unwilling to take care of the child let her give it up for adoption but the baby has the right to life just as much as the mother doess choice is just as important as the mother s 
in this debate i will seek to show that contrary to the claim of the pro speaker abortion is wrong both from the standpoint of health and also from a moral standpoint 
b abortion risks the mother s health this has been well documented and is not hard to find even by just searching the internet for the information 
that can be read here in the words of dr 
point  abortion compromises and does not benefit the mother s health now the moral implications of an abortion should be more than enough to convince us that abortion is unacceptable 
not only is abortion an immoral practice but it does not render a benefit to the mother 
point  life begins at conception a scientific evidence from the moment the male sperm is joined with the female egg all of the dna that will ever be present in the child that will later be born is already present 
the girl has been done a grave wrong but the fact that she has been done wrong does not give her the right to then do an even worse wrong to the baby she now carries 
yes you are right about the whole underage sex rape etc 
why is it wrong to have an abort 
 how many girs does not said that but its not true is someone else body inside of yours its not your choice then 
i believe abortion is wrong therefore i do not think it should be aloud 
and if people only did what felt good then this planet would be corrupt and i do not support corruption nor do i support the reckless decision of murdering a baby that someone was irresponsible to make and not take care or even put up for adoption and yes i am serious about not having sex if you do not want to run the risk of getting pregnant 
and sex is not a basic human need food water and shelter are basic human needs 
so by disagreeing with me means that you condone murder and you stated 
reasons to provide  
what makes since giving a unborn childa chance at life or just wasting the time to even think about it 
why would people go out of their way to create such an important amendment if they know it would start heated debates like this very debate 
i would like to start off by saying I have been searching for someone just as fun too debate as you and i could not 
last debate i plagorized and i feel awful for it so now I am only going to use links and context to help me in a rebuttal 
at this point your probably thinking fetuses are not babies well i would have to rebute you my good sir 
i would like to thank my opponent for agreeing to debate me once again 
hopefully this will be a good fun debate and may the best man win 
if it has nerve cells then why should not it feel pain 
instead of a real debate on a truly important topic you posted drivel 
as a result i took  minutes to repost stats from a single site 
thus by definition you appear to be the one with no life as you are wasting yours and other peoples time with stuff that you have no intention of fulfilling 
let us look at some of the effects on women who have abortions physical problemselevated risk of death a  government funded study in finland women who abort are approximately four times more likely to die in the following year than women who carry their pregnancies to term 
psychological problemsrequirement of psychological treatment a study of the medical records of   california medicaid patients revealed that women who had abortions were  percent more likely than delivering women to be hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in the first  days following abortion or delivery 
my opponent has basically referred to every persons mother on this site as an extreme pervert because the only criteria that he provided was that they were not using birth control or a condom 
this is true of both immediate complications and of long term reproductive damage 
the lowest incidence rate of ptsd reported following abortion is  
these problems may include one or more of the following loss of pleasure from intercourse increased pain an aversion to sex and or males in general or the development of a promiscuous life style 
these increased cancer rates for post aborted women may be linked to the unnatural disruption of the hormonal changes which accompany pregnancy and untreated cervical damage or to increased stress and the negative impact of stress on the immune system 
these findings support previous research which reported that during the year following an abortion women visited their family doctors  more for all reasons and  more for psychosocial reasons 
increased rate for teenagers teenagers who account for about  percent of all abortions are also at much high risk of suffering many abortion related complications 
ptsd while psychological reactions to abortion fall into many categories some women experience all or some of they symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd 
handicapped newborns abortion is associated with cervical and uterine damage which may increase the risk of premature delivery complications of labor and abnormal development of the placenta in later pregnancies 
eating disorders for at least some women post abortion stress is associated with eating disorders such as binge eating bulimia and anorexia nervosa 
suicide researchers in finland have identified a strong statistical association between abortion and suicide in a records based study see figure at the right 
approximately  of patients who are not infected by chlamydia develop pid within  weeks after a first trimester abortion 
alcohol drugs over twenty studies have linked abortion to increased rates of drug and alcohol use 
everybody is put on this earth to bring good how will that happen if someone is killed before it is even born 
yeah i do admit that i would not want to keep a child if i ever got raped 
why would you want to kill a baby when there are spouses who are unable to have kids and want to adopt 
women may have created the body of th baby but god created the soul 
if you are trying to prove a point that the baby will remind them of this terrible horrific act and that it is so dramatizing that they would kill an infant do not use the word basically rape in unconsented sex 
women seem to think that men take away a lot of their rights different topic but in fact i think that everybody should be able to do what they want with their bodies 
as I have said before unless the mothers life is at risk you are third paragraph has no relevance to this debate at all 
in a comment it said that i should use pro choice vs pro life to my advange 
if that babies heart does not beat at a certain time it will anyone 
if you do want to get pregnant that is your choice 
sometimes i wish could i post one of those yellow and black signs that say 
why should we take away life from a baby that does not even know what she he had been conceived out of 
there are different ways to continue through life with the same often anti abortion people bring up the point of the babies right 
you try to prevent it with condoms times pills etc 
if you do not want to get pregnant that is your choice 
also if this was true that doctors had to ask permission to abort the baby then we would be doing it with every abortion and since it takes so long that she would be dead anyway then we would have no babies being aborted and they would be all born 
there may be pain but its not worth ending a life for 
yeah i can not send her to school but there are tutors that many people use or home schooling 
I am not sure what exactly counts in determining when the baby is alive 
 if abortion were illegal the doctors could not just request the government let them slide by the law to save her life 
it is the government consulting with the doctors to make sure that there is no other way 
there is drugs and c sections so it is not all pain 
 something is illegal is illegal there are plenty of it is ands or buts in laws 
sometimes the assaulter uses protection sometimes girls are on birth control sometimes the egg is not fertilized and sometimes females lose the baby along the way 
you can tell because both of the parents are human the chromosomes and dna 
i got this from another debate I will comment the name and give credit in the comments later 
if you think that this means that my entire point is invalid then just because a baby or fetus cannot reproduce means it has the same worth as a  year old who cannot make babies 
lol if your not going to put up an actual debate I will just create another one with somebody else 
what distinguishes us from animals plants etc is that the cells are human 
a task or act that allows one to meet the demands of the environment and daily life 
if you do not want the child then there is something called a d o p t i o n 
no actually i chose to be a woman on tuesday thursday saturday and sometimes sunday depending on the weather 
you are stealing the babies first breath 
abortion should be completely illegal with the exception of endangering a mothers life 
no women should ever get an abortion i do not believe in them 
if this were the case then why is killing infants under three years of age illegal 
or how about the legality of slavery in the  and prior 
infants that young after all have not developed logic or full use of their brains yet 
i would now like to end this debate by saying that just because it is legal does not mean it is right 
the fact is that brains spinal cords heart and other organs start development at the third week after conception 
people can argue all they want about bettering the mother or the baby but what it comes down to is that abortion is the murdering an unborn fetus 
i would like to inform you also of that fact that after having an abortion many times mothers become depressed and face relationship problems 
you also argued quite a bit about how the well being of the mother is rarely taken into consent 
the event of having an abortion almost always puts more of an emotional burden on the mother than they would have had if the baby was born 
the top three reasons for having abortions would be can not afford the baby  of abortions unready for responsibility  and the mother is concerned with how the baby will change her life 
it is never determined for sure that any of the things you have said may happen 
you weigh your options between keeping someone unconsciously alive that has no hope or taking them off life support 
i do not blame you saying as this is the strongest aspect of any abortion debate 
I am curious as to how would defend this type of scenario as opposed to the stereotypical rape victim argument 
becoming a criminal hating life because of feeling neglected due to lack of parents or being disease ridden are all possibilities but the chances of those things happening are minute 
as for the financial situations that may because one to get an abortion adoptive services are always available for these types of reasons 
a baby who let us say does have a disease upon birth or has to face the burden of growing up without a mother or father is always better off than a person never even given a chance in the first place 
it is still a human being that is given no such choice in the matter or life or death 
another common argument is that the unborn fetus is not yet living at the time of abortion 
abortions can be done up to  weeks into the pregnancy 
what i do not understand is why the person least involved in the matter at all the baby is being punished most severely 
 new york city department of health and mental hygiene nyc gov february
 for these reasons abortion is bad and should not be allowed 
 abortion takes away from the unborn the unalienable right to life that the founding fathers intended for all human beings 
the federal unborn victims of violence act which was enacted states that under federal law anybody intentionally killing or attempting to kill an unborn child should be punished 
allowing abortion conflicts with the unalienable right to life recognized by the founding fathers of the united states 
since my opponent has failed to provide definitions for this debate i will do so here 
i will be posting my main argument in the second round but i challenge pro to answer these questions for me 
anyways i look forward to the second round of this debate 
everything has consequences it does not matter if your ready or not it is not your choice once the baby is conceived it is alive and yours 
that does not matter when deciding wether to abort or not abort a child 
you never know what will happen to any childs life in a formidable family broken or other 
if a woman is a single woman and the father is not around that child can absolutely have a great life are you that blind 
of course not it is alive and the same damn thing 
you can put sources down all you want but at the end of the day the vast majority of woman wish they never had an abortion and it haunts them 
if you do not believe in a god that is your choice 
so you are basically telling me at any point during pregnancy a woman has the choice because it is her womb and her body 
that being said you are ignorant again of the fact that at  weeks a child has brain waves and a faint heart beat 
if you had an abortion at  months yourself you are telling me that you did not end a life 
 months  months or up until the day it leaves the womans body 
if you can not do that then that is a irresponsible decision 
things happen for a reason and babys can have good lives coming from good or bad situations but it is there life and if we stop them from living it then what are we 
if they catch it in the first month then so be it but beyond that to me it should not be there choice to abort a human being with a heart beat and brain waves 
people can choose to do as they please we will all have to talk to the big guy one day but for me it is pro life because it is not our choice once a baby has any sign of life 
that being said those are my only pros 
thank you for accepting my request snd thank you to your parents for choosing to keep you so that we can have this debate 
abortion is taking the life of an innocent why is it right that we choose to call killing someone on the street a crime but killing a child that has not been born is acceptable 
i know that abortion is the womans right to kill the baby but they are just giving away lives that have just been born and i think that those lives deserve to live in this world no matter the case 
if you have any sence of justice or can see past the shockingly biased national media i e rte who my parents still have to pay their taxes to if you want to prevent  children from dieing per day due to abortion amount of children dying everyday from abortions in america if you want to keep ireland as a world leader for care in pregnant women if yo want to prevent full term abortion and euthanasia which i believe will be our next referendum then vote no 
even though some women say t mind to have one every time a woman has an abortion it just crushes her self esteem smaller and smaller and smaller 
something that i found extremely hateful and wrongful is that  of babies with down syndrome are aborted now talk about ableism 
i believe that being pro life goes hand in hand with being pro lgbtq being anti racist as these are all views just letting people live their life because we have no right to decide to undermine persecute or slaughter these humans just because we do not want them there or they re inconvenient for us to have to deal with 
the upcoming referendum in ireland to repeal the  amendment is just like giving a blank cheque to our government to do whatever they like to the only thing making ireland an extremely safe place to be pregnant in  
but i want to get back to my main point and that is if they have sex knowing the possible consequences whether they try to prevent it or not they should be held responsible period 
and you say that it can not be consider killing since it has not developed its organs so what you are still preventing it from having a life so you are taking its life and in that matter it is murder 
but if he had sex he knows the risks but does not care and if he gets a girl pregnant and since you do not think that adoption is good they both should be held responsible 
because men do not have to worry about getting pregnant and I am not saying its not the males fault either in fact its equal but if a girl gets an abortion than its not holding anybody responsible 
and the only reason i say its ok with rape is because it is not the womans fault but when its consensual sex it is the womans fault 
with a rape victim it is not her fault but if a girl is sleeping with every guy in school and she knows the consequences but does not care and gets pregnant she should have to deal with the consequence 
 she may even be spiteful that she is being forced into carrying an unwanted child for  months 
she knew that there was a possibility of getting pregnant but she obviously did not care 
now I am not trying to offend anybody but i want to know where women got this so called right of abortion 
however i am religious so you did not convince me but your arguments certainly bested mine 
jones is told they have to do an abortion 
if it is in the womb you are right it can not sustain itself but that does not mean it is not human 
not having sex or using a condom means that no baby fetus is even created so none is being killed 
but when they are born and can still not do anything then it is basically the same as being stillborn 
if you are not born yet why should you be killed 
i was not referring to the possibility which you pointed out is incredibly vague but the fact that it is there 
I am not saying we need more people beingborn just that they should not be killed unless it will  
my problem is that people will constantly say abortion is not murder but what is it then 
it takes away from the debate and if you have to go with semantics you should not be debating 
yes fetuses are living creations 
if you can not protect yourself not rape mind you that baby should not be put down because of your mistake 
they shold have the right to life 
why would you kill an innocent child 
i extend my arguments 
pro also states if you think that these questions do not matter and that all that matters to you is your life than you clearly have not yet matured enough to develop enough empathy to be able to truly understand the decision your mother has to make 
pro proceeds to say the government doesns past present or future or what may happen if the baby is born for all they know the mother was raped the mother has a deadly illness the baby could have a horribly painful life ending in a painful death or the mother and the baby could both die if the baby is born 
i have further proof that fetuses are human naral a pro abortion organization has even admitted that a fetus is a human being there is simply no doubt that even the early embryo is a human being 
as to being there is no doubt that it exists is alive is self directed and is not the same being as the mother and is therefore a unified whole 
he later states if judy nicastro hadn t had her abortion the baby would have had a miserable life that probably would have ended in a painful death as hard as it was for the mother she had to make the right decision to let her baby die in very little to no pain in a warm and loving place 
scientists say in order for something to be alive it has to be capable of growth reproduction and metabolism 
as I have said before it is completely immoral to take a human being s life to save your own 
however i do not agree with abortion because the fetus is not part of the woman 
pro also states see that it says and scientifically in order to be alive you must be able to eat breath and defecate 
the possibility of dying is no excuse for murder 
in order it win this debate i must prove that a fetus is a human being 
once again abortion kills a fetus a fetus is human and therefore abortion is murder 
this is because she believes that abortion does not fit the definition of murder 
as stated earlier in my rebuttal see rebuttal  a fetus is the same as a human 
case i will explain this again this whole argument is based on whether or not a fetus is in fact living and human 
pro mentioned a story about a woman who aborted one of her twins because it had a hernia 
 pro also said that fetuses cannot eat breathe or defecate 
i am absolutely for women s rights and i respect your opinion 
pro states i think that the definition you wrote is quite incorrect and i think you purposefully wrote one that would justify your argument 
to begin pro seems to disagree with the fact that abortion is murder 
also a fetus has no such concept of empathy and like you said it does not grasp the whole situation 
 my opponent also states pro life if you are not aware means that you believe the government should not only have a say in a womens decision of what is right to do with her body and her child but that it should have the only say 
 pro also stated the woman knows more about what is the right decision for her and her baby than someone who will most likely never meet either of them ever will 
last time i checked i would not be very happy if my mom aborted me as i would not get the chance to live and experience life 
therefore the government does have a place in abortion because it needs to protect the rights of that baby guaranteed by the constitution of the united states 
 another statement made by my opponent is i am not quite sure what he is trying to say but it is still no excuse for murder 
it falls under the jurisdiction of the preamble and can also be found relate able throughout the declaration of independence bill of rights etc 
another item the preamble mentions is securing the blessings of liberty to our posterity 
if the definition of posterity is correct as above the baby is entitled to the blessings of liberty 
here is the preamble to the constitution of the united states 
for women who demand complete control of their body control should include preventing the risk of unwanted pregnancy through the responsible use of contraception or if that is not possible through abstinence 
but to kill one of our own species is not the natural order 
no civilized society permits one human to intentionally harm or take the life of another human without punishment and abortion is no different 
since life begins at conception abortion is akin to murder as it is the act of taking human life 
those who choose abortions are often minors or young women with insufficient life experience to understand fully what they are doing 
in your rebuttal you say just because it is morally wrong to remove an egg and a sperm the egg and sperm fuse upon conception to form  chromosomes and  cell 
why would human life in this country be treated as anything other than equal 
killing the purest forms of human life is not a line in the future of this country 
a fetus may not be considered its own human being but because it is technically part of its mother it has the same rights 
a baby is alive it exhibits all seven characteristics of life it is composed of cells it has different levels of organization within its body it uses energy it responds to its environment it grows its cells can reproduce it adapts to its environment to kill a living thing without any justification other than the mother is not ready is not worthy to be practiced in the united states 
 what if the aborted baby finds the cure for cancer what if the aborted baby were to save a bus full of old people 
if the mother is an american citizen so is her baby and in this country all people are considered equal 
the only way to get their immoral behavior accepted would be to change the definition of commonly understood words 
of course there would be no chance for any harm to the mother if the baby were allowed to be born and then be put up for adoption 
iv although marx says nothing about a struggle between men and women the feminists adapted his revolutionary rhetoric to their own because 
anyone can see that this is only a very cynical attempt by the abortionist to kill the baby collect his fee and not be charged with murder 
you see it is widely believed in this country that individuals should be free to make their own choices 
v feminists believe that for women to win their struggle they must have total control over child bearing and be able to kill their unborn babies on demand 
they have been convinced by endless propaganda that the practice of unrestricted abortion is good and that it must be protected at all costs 
this extreme view comes from the radical feminists who argue foolishly that women should be free to choose to kill their unborn babies 
the supporters of the final solution in hitler s germany made similar arguments when they advocated exterminating the mentally I will and others 
they were deprived of the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness written about by our founding fathers in the declaration of independence 
karl marx whose writings led to the disaster of communism believed that society was dominated by a struggle between the bourgeoisie owners of production and the proletariat workers 
the name pro choice gives the evil abortion movement an aura of american liberty and apple pie 
iii the feminists have cast this principle aside by allowing women to kill their unborn babies 
the pro abortion activists have foisted on us this same semantic game 
they refer to the unborn child as a fetus 
since the supreme court handed down the roe v wade decision in  some  million abortions have been committed in this nation 
let us further say that the evilness of drinking milk was obvious to everyone including children 
babys form in wombs not egg shells like a chicken 
whether it is fully formed or not does not make the baby less human 
either way chicken or human a baby is forming 
google com a fetus is simply an unborn baby or an unborn human 
i would venture to say that what makes us human is our own conscience our volitional decisions a heart that beats and blood that flows 
so whether or not a chickens baby is growing inside of an egg and you kill it to eat an egg has nothing to do with what is morally wrong because we are totally allowed to kill chickens and eat them 
okay to clarify are we talking about the abortion of a chicken or the abortion of a human being 
if one was to venture to say that you are not human if you are not fully formed then you would have to call a lot of handicapped people unhuman 
if it does not make them any less human then that must mean that those things are never what made them human in the first place 
so go on ahead and throw these at me and let us get real and down to facts 
there is a a child inside your body and you should give birth then get rid of it 
well its unfair to the babies and the people having abortions can always have them because they are already legal 
like i said they could give the baby away 
think of all gods dead babies 
if a person who does not know there alive but is age  is it ok to kill them 
thank for the tips but with the fetus you said that some babies are born with no lims and some do not even know there alive 
i give thanks for this doing this debate with me 
back to the debate here is a study done by docters on how many abortions are done total number of abortions in the you s    
yet after he she is born it is not ok 
 million abortions per day   abortions per hour   abortions every  minutes  abortion every  seconds and when you said it is up to the mother for the abortion 
question if ou would abort it why did you even have it in the first place 
its wrong its evil and its against the laiw 
they will have a life and you just ruined it for them 
its just killing the person before he she is born 
it is a human being not a it 
if it does not then the doctor should be able to refuse the mother the ability to prevent a perfectly capable organism from being brought into the world 
pro has failed to actually refute my opening construct the only argument he provided was that moms and dads should choose with no supporting evidence 
I am not denying that women should have access to abortions I am arguing that they should not be the ones deciding to terminate the life 
personhood begins after a fetus becomes able to survive outside the womb or after birth not a conception is there any reason this arbitrary time period in fetal development is any more correct than personhood beginning at conception 
to what basis is it determined that parents would be better equipped to handle the decision to end prevent a life 
I am sure you could ask any foster child as to whether they would rather be there or never have lived at all and get the former answer 
this is a digression but the aim is to give women equal rights to men not to give them more of certain rights and men having other rights 
the answer is far from simple but one must consider when searching for it that abortion if practiced at all should only be seen as a last resort 
you could argue that she has the best interest of it in mind due to the natural bonds she develops but again those bonds are not a human nurse with an objective best interest to both the child and mother 
he claims that abortion can save a child from having to deal with isues like pain brain injuries and poverty 
death is an easy way to avoid any problem but it should not be left up to another as to whether a solution this permanent is justified 
meaning that the abortion is not only affecting her and her body it is a decision to decide whether to kill something or not 
my opponent and i will be sharing the bop in this debate since this is a dual sided topic where both cases can build arguments 
however when you consider the same effect can be achieved by simply slaughtering the child upon birth then you can see the error in this logic 
there are plenty of reasons i disagree with your stance but since this is your debate topic and your rules you go first 
i will be taking the stance against abortion and will provide evidence that suggests the precedence of a living child being inside a mothers womb and that it is immoral and should be illegal to take an innocent victims life 
again my opponent has failed to produce any arguments to defend his her point 
my opponent has failed to produce any arguments to defend his her point 
but what wrong has a speechless baby done that it deserves execution similar to that of criminals here in the world outside of the womb 
i would have to argue that all countries in the world have certain laws that defend an individual who takes a life through self defense or execution or war etc 
we live in a world where there are state of the art technologies and medical facilities for just such situations and studies have shown that when given proper support most women who are pregnant because rape gradually change their attitudes about their unborn child from something repulsive such as abortion to someone who is innocent and uniquely worthwhile 
but the life of a human is the product of the combination of human dna so whether it is developed facial features or not the second the sperm comes into contact with the egg that combination makes it human 
since when do we kill those whose only was being brought into existence based on the choice of his or her parents 
however since i do not know your religious affiliation i will leave religion out of this debate to avoid any comments that may be perceived as disrespectful 
so to have an abortion would mean that the baby feels the cold steel knife cutting it up but has no voice to defend itself against such cruelty 
if you have concluded that it is not the right time to have children then what is the point of even having intercourse in the first place 
the argument of being assumes the stance that the unborn is not fully human however science clearly proves the contrary 
the answer is simple it depends on the choice of those in power who carry the knife who redefine the meaning of life and those who decide which individual is worthy of life and who is not 
there is no logic in executing someone that has broken no law and such actions are therefore deemed as murder 
as i stated before abortion is a big deal it can because serious psychological impairment to the woman in the form of depression an guilt 
should a person be so irresponsible to land up in a situation where they have to be merciless to the unborn 
and the mothers life in danger does not always have to have a reason to have an abortion she might just have a miscarriage in the early period which could lead to having an abortion but that did not mean she wanted that to happen things can go right and wrong 
if your not ready to have a child and you get pregnant abortion is not an answer 
choosing adoption as an alternative to abortion would give the baby it is right to live 
you stated giving life to an unwanted child might invite world of troubles for the mom and the child so are we being fair to the child 
there would not be any troubles if the mother does not want nothing to do with child she should just give it up for adoption killing a life is like killing a part of you 
it has nothing to do with abortion unless she is already pregnant then yea she should be forced to produce a life giving birth is a miracle just because she may not want the baby does not mean she can not give the baby up for adoption because unlike her there are people in the world who may or trying to have a child but can not she is really lucky in many cases she should not kill the baby 
instead the world needs to start funding services to actually support women through pregnancies and make their difficult situations pleasant and make them feel like they are cared about 
all governments should stop funding organisations like planned parenthood that do not support women in any way shape or form and manipulate them into using their abortion services to make billions of dollars for the greedy men at the top and murder  million children yearly 
if you had ever encountered the child of a rape victim or a woman who carried through with her pregnancy after suffering the horrible injustice of rape you would come to realise that having the child is not as awful as it is made out to be 
slavery and the holocaust were once legal and i think we can both agree that that does not justify them in any way shape or form 
all humans deserve to be protected under the law if you are going to exclude an entire section of the human race because they are dependant on others or biologically immature or temporarily incapable of certain high level biological functions that is a legal form of discrimination and discrimination of the highest order 
she has cancer and is pregnant and needs the chemo to save her life but a bi product of that is that the baby will be aborted 
a reason for this is because the child in the womb is a human being and that is inarguable as regards scientific fact 
however as i have said before there is a line that needs to be drawn when the mother just finds it inconvenient to have the child or dislikes the gender race or the fact that a child had a disability etc 
well i know it is hard to raise a child these days but their are other ways to not take care of the child one way is adoption another is to let her parents take car of it 
what about after the cord is cut since the baby is still completely dependent on others for survival and its brain is still not developed 
assuming that terminating human life is wrong the central point of this issue is whether a fetus should be considered a human life 
by this time a fertilized egg has already implanted in the uterus and is dividing cells 
 even if an abortion happens immediately after pregnancy can first be confirmed  weeks the embryo has already begun developing a brain spinal cord and heart 
 that separates plants and animals from things like water or rocks  an organismic state characterized by capacity for metabolism growth reaction to stimuli and reproduction starting with the first definition we must ask if an embryo has the ability to grow and change 
all  chromosomes as well as the human specific dna that comes with them are present in the zygote the moment fertilization occurs 
medically life is defined as the energy that enables organisms to grow reproduce absorb and use nutrients and evolve 
at the very earliest moment a woman can know she is pregnant a fertilized egg has already begun to grow and change 
i agree that abortion most commonly refers to induced pregnancy termination and that is what i will focus on 
let us move on to another category 
the combination of  chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in  chromosomes in the zygote 
people love to bring this up but these cases make up only a minute fraction of total abortions performed 
a miscarriage is not an abortion because the term implies a degree of intentionality 
I am not sure pro even read my round  argument and if they did they failed to respond to it 
the child would be better off with parents who care and have enough money to support them and what not 
and i do not eat eggs or seeds simply for the fact that they are still children 
this would be better for the mother and the child if the mother did not have an abortion 
now i also understand the people who have been raped and ended up pregnant and cannot bear to have a child but in the instance of rape and incest proper medical care can ensure that a woman will not get pregnant 
there are many options other than abortion that people can do adoption is a viable alternative to abortion and accomplishes the same result 
so to be technical there are other options than taking something that could be someones life 
now let us say that you are to young to have a child or not prepared but want a child in the long run well having an abortion done always carries the risk of not being able to become pregnant ever again in life 
i do not think a guy could have one of those anyways I am talking about the abortion cases where they got pregnant and just aborted it because they did not want the responsibility excuses are like buttholes everyone has one 
a baby is a gift from god that does not decide when to enter a persons life 
after the abortion she can have severe abdominal pain which can affect you from standing up 
your taking the life of an innocent human being which can be considered commiting a crime 
cervix and organ damage can affect the possibilty of having children 
abortion is a very contravertion topic laws should be made to avoid causes that lead to that such as under age pregnancy 
there are options to avoid abortion such as thinking with the brain inside your skull rather then the one between your legs and there are pills the person could take prier that is why strict laws on this type of issue could prevent this sort of thing 
there is also a chance you may never be able to have another child again 
picture this image for me a fetus or baby whatever word you would like to use with fingers toes fingernails toenails limbs etcf eatures me and you have and then the d x abortion procedure itself is rather gruesome 
the abortion practitioner instrumentally reaches into the uterus grasps the fetus feet and pulls the feet down into the cervix 
 protecting human life it is the core of the argument 
since no premature infants were younger than  weeks it did not determine the earliest age at which the fetus would feel pain 
 feeling pain yes o oa recent study examined the question of fetal pain through the direct measurement of cortical brain responses in premature infants 
once the fetus has been delivered except for the head surgical scissors are forced into the base of the fetal skull and the its brains are sucked out 
acog org more credible than your wikipedia sources you go on saying that my points are irrelevant although they defend my case and go against your points 
the baby inside the mothers womb is a genetically different human being than the mother so the question is how is killing a baby inside the womb or one minute out of the womb any different 
first of all you can always deliver the baby after  weeks giving the mother and the baby a chance to live 
a key question to any pro choice is when does life begin 
lastly the word fetus comes from latin roots meaning a child up to the age of eighteen 
instead of saying not to have sex because you are a minor they give out condemns and birth control 
if penetration of the vagina is indeed illegal if the legal age is not reached why then should it be legal for vaginal penetration to occur the other way before that age 
before it can feel pain a so you are saying if one cannot feel pain than it is okay to kill him her 
I will be the pro life defender 
like cells in someones hair or fingernails an egg or sperm does not have the capacity to become other than what it already is 
a sperm has  chromosomes and no matter what even though it is alive and can fertilize an egg it can never make another sperm 
at what minute can one consider life to be worthless and at the next minute that life to be precious 
this new life is not a sperm or an egg or even a simple combination of both 
from the time those  chromosomes become  onward the unborn is a living developing individual with a unique genetic makeup 
yet medical research proves that the fetus is a living organism from the moment of conception 
once there is the union of a sperm and egg the  chromosomes are brought together in one cell with  chromosomes 
it is not a human life or some type of life because something non human does not magically become human by getting older and bigger whatever is human must be human from the beginning 
both are essentially dead ends destined to remain what they are until they die in a matter of days
