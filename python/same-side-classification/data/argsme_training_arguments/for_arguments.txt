i also think incidentally that you could be personally against abortion but allow people to decide for themselves but only if you do not think it is certainly a person and are using the freedom issue 
i acknowledge the society can have a say but I am simply saying if it says the laws are arbortion friendly it is rational not that it is analogous completely to areas where it can obviously exist 
now there is the life and liberty of the putative child to consider 
any differences of opinion we might have it seems would be an inherent value judgment call and tehres not much more to discuss 
am i understanding you the main point you made is that any chance of no life is such that we should defer given the infinite loss potential versus the loss of the choice of the mother 
 if no liberty there is no life 
i realize that my stared quote is only certainly applicable to the person themself to decide to live and teh child does not have the chance or putatuive child 
 aside from the literal fact that you are not killing it in tree form the unique set of dna stuff is an interesting biological idea that you might think since it is unque it is a person but it is simply not necessarily the case 
i think so because machines can make a person function when they are clearly dead this creeps out family of the dead if they see it they do it for saving organs etc sometimes and if you start using machines one by one on a person their heart and brainwaives the things that make them clinically alive or not can be usurped by machines and later they are vital signs would be working again 
would you consider smashing to acorn to be the same as having killed an acorn tree 
and if all the person is is machines and a beating heart are theyu alive 
could there be a point when it is unclear like when machines start taking over a body 
on one side you have human red blood cells on the other ameoba type organisms 
true the cell in your arm is not going to grow into a person but the analogy can still exist as it is similar enough to make the point the initial cell is like a block and not the final product 
it does not seem like a person would die in this regard even though it is a natural phenomenon and not the same as abortion 
at a certain point it clearly is a human and it is unreasonable to think otheriwse 
and in a way the machine argument goes beyond the idea that the early cells are in questionable form and shows that the mother cuold be like a machine on a lifeless body 
of coruse the government could decide a point it thinks it is a person cleary but that is not necessarily the early organism cell 
but i simply disagree and think it is a reasonable position to have 
 i think it is reasonable to think reasonably disputed life can be valued less than the freedom to choose 
true the early cell is unique no other dna like this an separate its own entity 
if you have a snowball that you are going to use to get to that snowman before he exists the snowball obviously is not a snowman 
if you have a cell like a block and start building the cell is not necessarily a human person either 
to the counter contention that your red blood cell does not grow into a person 
 most arguments are very lacking but i think this one is not so much no one knows so who should decide 
 it is often the moral thing to do to defer to allowing others the freedom to do something heres it is unclar whether it is hurting another but the principle still is here and needs weighed 
i said the safest way to do it is do not because that truly is the safest way but i am by no way saying that a couple can not have sex if they do not want a baby when did i even remotely say that 
i am in no way against a couple pleasuring each other 
i was clearly on about if she got pregnant without wanting to 
if you want to knock her up go ahead 
this debate has sort of skewed on way 
abortion is one of these hard topics to discuss but being the controversial person i am i will take you on 
I will give you some examples why it should for example let us say someone was raped and they did not want a baby but now they are pregnant 
another example would be if the condom split during the act 
it is not it is own life yet and the embryo would not be concious until it developed a brain which happens later into the pregnancy 
there has to be a sanction for breaking a law whether that is a fine or a prison sentence 
but anyways the first trimester is the best time to abort the pregnancy as all the embryo is at this point is a ball of stem cells 
conduct no rounds are dropped but i think it is clear from the quality of the debate the argumentation and the spelling and grammar that the pro made a mockery of this debate 
as a last ditch effort the pro attempts to characterize thomsons burglar analogy as faulty by saying that leaving a door open in a dangerous neighborhood is not tantamount the act of having sex 
this seems like the kind of plan that one would submit for decriminalizing marijuana or drugs or some other practice that is already against the law 
primarily we must see that there really is no such thing as a passive action 
on this rather bizarre argument from the pro that if there is an accident that attaches a victim to a wrong doers body no would would argue that the wrong doer should kill the innocent victim 
to quickly address the bop argmentation there is nothing that the pro has provided that really substantially answers the question of why we should accept this rather vague notion that it should be illegal to have an abortion during the first tri mester but that this law should not be pursued 
the pro provides no solid reasoning as to why we should accept this resolution 
there is no formalized argumentation and the bop is not upheld 
my point here is that throughout the argumentation you have been presented with there is really no substantiation as to why we should follow this sort of plan 
however even if you do not buy this distinction the pro does not argue how this negates the idea that a fetus does not posses rights to its mothers body 
however if we further look at this point the act of leavingt ones door open is active 
using this conception of the law and justice i will argue that abortion should not be illegal in the sense that abortion does not infringe upon a fetus rights if they indeed have any in such a manner that it constitutes law to prevent it 
i feel like there was not any formalized argumentation from my opponent to start this debate so i fee like this is a chance for me to present an opening statement of sorts that explains where my argumentation in this debate is going to go 
in negating this resolution i will argue specifically that the legality of an action comes form the idea that ones rights end where anothers begin 
and i have another point if abortion is legal in rape etc 
you are arguing the pro side which means that you support the initial claim i as con am pointing out that even if i agreed with your ideas on the morality of abortion i do not putting a non punitive law in effect is useless 
 then i bet a lot of women would claim to be raped by someone in order to get an abortion 
and i would prefer to have an abortion than to have a child raised in poor possibly abusive circumstances 
it is an incorrect assumption to assume that everyone who wants an abortion will be able to afford a baby 
many people do not have enough money or time to care for children 
my point was that your main topic of the debate does not make sense because laws with no punishment will not be followed as strictly as laws that do have punishment 
even if a women decided to choose life she may be subjected to putting her child in the hands of the man who attacked her 
in the case of incest the child is at a high risk for defects and disorders something that would bring pain and suffering to both the mother and the child 
the adoption system in the you s is not the best either 
the government should not force women to carry the product of their attack to term unless they want too which a completely different story 
i appluad the women who are strong enough to keep the child but i do not frown upon those who make their choice of abortion when the pain and suffering is too great 
imagine every shred of your safety and security being torn to shreds behind a dumpster in the middle of the night 
imagine if you got raped and pregnant then you had to carry that baby for nine months 
i am against killing a baby if you are just playing around 
i think that abortion should be legal if you have been raped by a relative or a random stranger 
I am afraid i do not understand what my opponent wanted to communicate in the last round apart from the ad hominem remarks 
therefore a that carries no penalties for its violators would be just a demonstration of holier than thou attitude 
in a free country people in the minority are required to follow the laws set by the majority or face the penalties 
even assuming that this resolution would accurately reflect their views in pluralistic society those who disagree with the majority are still entitled to their own opinions 
 the main difference between successful western countries and oriental despotisms is the rule of law with a clear boundary between legal and illegal 
ok let us stick to the argument at hand the question is not whether or not i should have engaged in sexual activity 
the very fact that there is a age restriction is why people abort ilegally 
I am sure there are people who are legally obligated to report a loss of life 
its individual such as yourself that can not take any decisions on their own that needs constant validation that makes the rest of us look bad 
and for something to be a law it must be enforced 
since my opponent did not offer a definition of a law i thought it would be prudent to do so 
the principles and regulations established in a community by some authority and applicable to its people whether in the form of legislation or of custom and policies recognized and enforced by judicial decision 
why spend the money to create a law if you have no intention to enforce the law 
it would have been nice if she could have explained what she was trying to say 
i am unable to decipher what my opponent is saying here 
it costs money that could be better spent on programs that provide benefits to society 
if as my opponent says then it only makes sense that the law should be enforced 
 a law that is not enforced is a waste of taxpayer money 
not only is it in bad taste to characterize your opponent either specifically or in the general sense of people who disagree with you it is not a valid means of argument 
thus if minimal violence is used against the fetus in an abortion the procedure does not violate its rights 
pros argument would lead to the conclusion that we have an obligation to build sentient robots that can engage in discourse and thus have a moral duty toward metals that can be mined from the earth 
patient dichotomy does not matter because i am contending that we are not acting immorally toward the fetus not that we do not have to behave morally toward it 
if a child assaulted someone this would certainly be grounds for that person to stop taking care of it 
construing abortion as the use of a fetus as a means to have sex without giving birth is a rather twisted interpretation of my ethical approach 
in his continued unsupported assertion of the positive right to life pro points out that he has a right not to be placed in a volcano because he cannot survive there 
i accept pros formulation of my argument as reasonably fair though he seems to have misunderstood it at points as i will discuss 
children qua children are not violating anyones rights simply by existing while this may very well be the case for a fetus 
another substantial issue with this point is that even if the born do have the right to life and this has hardly been proven it would not necessarily mean fetuses do too 
this is just broadening the meaning of the word use beyond its relevance to the topic 
an ss officer concedes that his position is morally invalid by refusing to debate it 
in my original context the word use referred only to using a body as a physical instrument a life support system specifically 
 final comment on fetal innocence i am not going to make new comments on this because it is not part of pros offensive but i will remind readers that i specifically addressed pros point about active and passive rights violations in my affirmative case under  
even if this was not the case i have attacked positive rights in every round of this debate and i proposed my own coherent moral theory which allows for abortion 
 contra positive obligations again pro offers no proof whatsoever for his conclusion that children are entitled to something so i could counter that point just be saying no they do not 
this is an issue that is brought up in the first few pages of every basic ethics book and yet frequently overlooked by those who understand the finer points inside and out 
introduction trents argument is well presented and he defends his points rigorously but he is off the mark on what the resolution asks for 
however i do not accept that the right to life is included among these rights and that was not a requirement 
my detailed analysis of what rights human beings have which does not include a positive right to life greatly outweighs pros unsupported assertion 
pro after all is the one trying to establish a normative claim that abortion is immoral given our assumptions and he has offered no normative analysis 
these restraints on behavior can be called moral rules if morality is to have any meaning it is the rules which constrain our actions toward one another 
in my affirmative i made an argument against the possibility of positive rights which i will defend in my closing argument 
i invite the audience to reread pros  in his own words he does not argue that humans have a right to life he only argues that humans at all stages of development have the same rights 
no positive right to life was established in the affirmative arguments of this debate and i was the only one who defended any rights at all negative rights 
I will go through his premises and conclusions and give my criticisms then offer my own points in response 
i established in my affirmative argument that it is justifiable to use force to end a rights violation a contention i will defend in my closing 
once again his argument is very strong but not relevant to affirming the resolution we have already assumed this premise 
 the nonaggression principle the conclusion from  and  is that we may not violate the property rights of other people if we hold discourse to be a rational means of normative inquiry 
if you and i cannot use the same object it is necessary to fairly determine who shall have priority 
there is not and could not be an agreement implicit or otherwise that he may remain on the truck 
we ourselves are therefore no longer operating within the bounds of rational discourse and our victim is justified in taking action against us to defend his rights 
it is especially noteworthy that without the assumption of initial freedom debating norms becomes absurd 
if i agreed to work for you for a year for free and then change my mind the most you can do is demand material property as compensation you cannot enslave me without aggressing against my rights 
this argument is used to justify property in the traditional sense of material possessions as well but for the purpose of the debate i will include only the argument for ownership of one s body 
 this point can be confusing because there is no direct action taken to violate the mother s rights 
hoppe makes this argument but it is considered most significant by roger pilon who argues that we cannot deny the premises that we presuppose merely by acting 
if a person does not consent to our use of his body and we proceed to use him anyway we are violating his rights and the nap 
if a were unable to communicate with b he could still justifiably remove a from his property using the minimal necessary force 
through our rejection of the principle of nonviolence we have lost our claim to negative rights 
the existence of such a right would automatically violate the negative right of self ownership of someone else through binding him to act in a certain way and would therefore be unacceptable 
unlike most other pro choice arguments it is not based on whether the fetus is a person so i will not be contesting that point i am skeptical as to whether the fetus can be considered a member of the moral community but i see this as nonessential 
i believe that a person is the sole owner of his or her body and has total discretion in its use 
i accept trent hs challenge on the morality of abortion 
so i can just as easily say to pro that if a man truly wanted a woman to have his baby he could have should have had sex only in a legal or spiritual commitment such as marriage where both parties agreed to have a baby should pregnancy be the consequence of their actions 
first of all it is amusing how the house has come to represent the mother when originally the house represented the father pro said in  if i had your dog in my house would i be able to do with it whatever I would like 
if a woman was hired to be a surrogate mother and upon childbirth did not want to give up the child she would be under violation of a reproductive contract 
he has ignored my entire argument which has been that the dog cannot represent the fetus because a dog is a living entity outside of myself whereas a fetus is not a living entity outside of the mother 
therefore even if one was inviting the consequence of pregnancy this debate is once again not about whether abortion is right or wrong but whether or not a male has any right to force a woman to carry a child to term 
pro then said we have already said in the resolution that the mothers health and therefore body does not have a bearing because this is a 
yes i agree that contraceptives are for those who want to enjoy the physical pleasures of sex in a responsible way to not transmit disease or result in an unwanted pregnancy 
the father is essentially useless once fertilization occurs and even that happens as a result of his ejaculated sperm the father does not do anything himself to fertilize the egg that all happens within the mothers body 
 just because the risks associated with the average pregnancy may not fall under the category of a does not mean that other health concerns are not elevated in general in association with pregnancy 
when a child is a fetus the father has no responsibilities they all lie with the mother whom is carrying it 
because abortion is legal and not the subject of this debate we must accept that abortion is an alternative for those who get pregnant and consider abortion a viable option 
 she is the one who gains weight and other body defects she is the one who gives birth and she is the one on which the fetus relies for survival etc 
 pro says the house in the analogy represents the mothers body 
if the living dog already existed as a separate entity from myself and my opponent we would both have rights and therefore i would not have the right to kill the dog without pros permission 
as I have pointed out a dog is already a living thing separate from both myself and my opponent i e the mother and the father 
in order for his analogy to work he would have to prove that the people in question mother and father had sex solely for the purpose of pregnancy 
pro says that if two consenting adults choose to have sex when the goal is not for reproduction that they are engaging in this activity for the reasons 
since he cannot prove that people always have sex for the purpose of getting pregnant then he cannot say that we I am using this pronoun for the purpose of the analogy entered an agreement mutually to buy a pet 
while pro might wish to dismiss my premise regarding what is required of the father by law he has failed to combat the very notion that abortion is about a womans choice and not mans property 
this agreement is all fine and dandy unless my dog does not produce the puppies at all for whatever reason 
second assuming that i would actually accept the analogy that the dog represents the fetus in this case the analogy still fails on the basis that a dog is a living entity outside of myself or my opponent 
in other words people do not solely engage in sex just to have children so the reproductive correlation of sex is not the only aspect to be taken into consideration for this debate in terms of analysis or definitions 
instead sex is more like a mutual agreement to have intercourse with each other usually with the aim of reaching climax and that is it 
to conclude his say in this debate pro asks the question if this dog is both truly ours and just happens to be residing in your home at the moment what gives you the right to kill it without by permission 
the father does not have a say in abortion because abortion is about the womans right to choose not the mans right to property 
we have already agreed that a fetus is not yet a child or person and therefore has no right to anything 
requiring a woman to take unnecessary risks with her life and body and pregnancy always greatly increases medical risks just because the man who ejaculated into her says that she must is indicative of slavery and a blatant infringement upon her rights 
pro is suggesting that a man can force biological impositions onto a woman just because they have had sex 
I am glad to see that my opponent concedes to the fact that a person and not a fetus has rights 
as for my opponents sole argument i agree that the fetus belongs just as much to the father as it does to the mother 
my stance as con so far rests simply on the logic that as a fetus no rights exist for the unborn child 
as such the mothers body does not belong to the father and therefore the father has no jurisdiction over what the mother subjects her body to

not only will the child suffer but society will suffer when that child develops a higher attraction to crime welfare etc 
  autonomy however even if we assume that all fertilized eggs fetuses have personhood equal to that of a birthed child and they would all choose to force their biological parent to carry the pregnancy to birth which i do not believe is a solid assumption based on the reasons given in  i still do not believe this is sufficient justification for denying a person the right to an abortion 
my point here is that the closer the fetus comes to being a the less likely a pregnant person is to abort and if they are it is often due to circumstances that are at least in some way beyond their control 
i do not believe a pregnant person should have the right to enter a hospital a take eggs stored for in vitro fertlization ivf and smash them on the ground simply because they do not agree with the idea of human pregnancy 
cats and dogs who are common companions to people and though cognitively very different from humans share some forms of communication with humans are more likely to be protected under animal abuse laws 
if there is some force of nature or a that rules that abortion is morally unacceptable then what should we do about the unintentional abortions a k a miscarriages that as humans we do not yet have control over 
i would also note that in the circumstances of late term abortions it is rarely a choice by the pregnant person to have such a late abortion 
if we want to value the autonomy of an individual we must support the choice of a person who is demonstrating having an opinion on the circumstances before the inability to choose of a creature who has no ability to make a choice 
this is because we have a better understanding of these animals in the sense that we recognize that they have thoughts and feelings and are able to interact with their environments on a more cognitive level than say a fish or a slug 
to be clear though as regrettable as the loss of life of the abortum is we cannot allow the grief associated with that event to justify taking away the autonomy of a person 
let us say that you disagree with  because you do not think deciding a moral system should be in the hands of humans themselves but it should be derived from a higher power beyond our control 
even if a fetus nears personhood it is still inhabiting the body of another person who has the right to expel it if they desire 
  personhood however while the egg fetus are both humans i would not classify either one as a true 
the most commonly cited reason for taking longer to get an abortion was inability to make arrangements quickly  and this reason was cited about twice as frequently by poor women guttmacher  
if you want to enter this debate you should believe that there are at least some cases when a pregnant person should not have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion 
you have to let anyone use this service before the first  weeks or else raped women will have nowhere to have an abortion because abortion clinics will all go out of business 
 science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks 
he cannot win this debate because it would be tremendously unfair for him to rebut the following points or bring up new ones without me ever getting to see his point of view to rebut it 
however these are only a small number of women at abortion clinics 
the points conceded are science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks 
for example in the future I am afraid that if a woman has a baby with blue eyes instead of i do not know green eyes she will just give up her and try again and again 
I have responded to all his arguments 
 abortion laws are unconstitutional because they limit freedom and take lives of unhealthy women 
 abortion laws are unconstitutional because they limit freedom and take lives of unhealthy women 
opponent you can always give the constitutional blah blah limiting of freedoms crap speech but that does not make your arguments morally correct 
 during the era of abortion bans women would shove hangars down themselves 
you have to let anyone use this service before the first  weeks or else raped women will have nowhere to have an abortion because abortion clinics will all go out of business 
but no woman should be forced by her government to have a child 
however these are only a small number of women at abortion clinics 
it is the womans choice of what to do with her body and no government should be so tyrannical as to force her to have an unwanted child or to get an illegal abortion which is likely to kill her and the baby 
 here are some points of mine you never rebutted and therefore i should win upon unless you concede them or rebut them in the future science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks 
 abortion laws are unconstitutional because they limit freedom and take lives of unhealthy women 
 during the era of abortion bans women would shove hangars down themselves 
a person who has not attained maturity or the age of legal majority 
it is something in the womans body without feelings thoughts or life period 
what if a woman or girl you loved your mother or girlfriend got pregnant and you knew she would die when she had the baby 
 science proves that a baby cannot think or feel until the third trimester about  weeks 
 during the era of abortion bans women would shove hangars down themselves 
this is why you see a lot more fathers abandoning children than mothers 
abortion laws turn due dates into death dates 
 the constitution uses the word not to restrict the government  times 
certain women are not healthy enough to give birth 
god obviously wants a mother to love her child so she has to suffer with it for nine months 
and some of these women are not healthy enough to give birth 
if they are lucky enough to survive the rape they are sure to die during child birth 
 abortion laws are unconstitutional and unhealthy women to kill themselves for the sake of a child that nobody knows or loves unlike the woman 
good luck voters 
let us consider some cases that a minor might not want to get permission from her parents 
if they are deemed mature competent with reasonable understanding of their actions then they are looked at similar to an autonomous person with valid choices 
thanks opponent i do not believe abortion is essential to the health of a pregnant minor i do believe abortion is essential to the health of a pregnant minor if it is deemed necessary by a physician in the case where the patient will face severe complications if the pregnancy is not aborted i do agree with my opponent that there are risks associated with abortion such as the ones outlined by my opponent i am certain physicians balance the benefits and costs before suggesting abortion thus when medical abortion is suggested it is to the benefit of the patient i do not agree with my opponent that parents know when an abortion is necessary more than doctors do the question of family morals is a different issue 
outcome  if the daughter has no competence in regards to her condition future and accepting the medical treatment then the parents are abusing their daughter by not accepting the medical treatment and jeopardizing their daughters life 
the mother does not agree with physicians that d needs to undergo medical treatment 
since the daughter can not comprehend her situation and the parents decision is not in the best interest of the daughter 
here are some things for you to consider parents cannot simply decide to refuse a medical treatment that is determined to be necessary and essential for their daughter by a physician such as a medical abortion or in the case of this news article from this week lymphoma the judge will base this on the patients wishes decision and the patients best interest health regardless of parents choice now the pros argument mainly surround the assumption that     summary  physicians do not assess the maturity of the patient in regards to decision making however this is only true in some situations 
instead parents who are more experienced in such affairs shall make a decision that they think will most benefit their daughter here is my response to the numbered arguments above you need to consider one thing this is real life not a cliche made up world 
 i believe that all parents know what is in the best interest of their children no matter what the circumstances 
 bottom of page  i will simply disagree with the pros argument that parents can be better judges than physicians in regards to when a medical abortion is necessary to terminate an I will pregnancy that can physically harm the child 
i do understand that abortion can be life threatening which is exactly why children should not be left to tend to it 
however i understand you may be referring to the maturity level of children in regards to an unfamiliar situation and that the decision might not be at their level and so the parents make the decision 
this process determines if the patient has the potential to make her own decisions or not whether it is for against abortion 
this issue becomes more clear once it is looked at in depth and with reason 
they can decide without anyones help if they want to drink a glass of milk or laser shooting bees on fire 
however if their decisions actions not respecting the daughters own decision will result in harm to their daughter ie not wanting to abort a pregnancy that may kill their daughter then the physician can take legal action against the parents and child services agencies and the court will also get involved in the decision making 
therefore they are not identical 
the us supreme court in planned parenthood v casey states that a fetus only becomes viable after  weeks and upheld a womans right to an abortion before that point 
merriam webster defines the following as such hypocrisy feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not especially the false assumption of an appearance of virtue or religion murder the unlawful killing of another person the first definition seems to unhinge my opponents argument 
therefore it is not inconsistent to support abortion because those who do do not see it as the killing of a person but rather a medical decision made by the woman 
as far as the death penalty is concerned there are a multitude of reasons why liberals and non liberals oppose it 
a black defendant on trial for murder is  more likely to be given they death penalty than a defendant of any other race and nearly  of all victims in death penalty cases are white despite the fact that whites make up only about  of all murder victims  
what numbers exist show that the demographic most likely to have a late term abortion are girls under  years of age cdc what evidence do you provide that increasing regulation would decrease the number of abortions anyway 
i find it hard to believe of all abortions are in countries where the procedure is illegal guttmacher et al 
there is dispute that it can be called murder especially when you have not defined murder with respect to non human entities 
the key feature of a child which demands it the protection of law is not that it is presently a rational thinking self aware being but rather that it will become one when it reaches adulthood and certainly this is no less true of the child in utero 
the property owner is the absolute ruler of their property and just as i can expel you from my home if you remain there without my consent so a mother is the absolute ruler of her body and can expel the invader the baby from her body if she wishes 
by saying that the state in reality some bureaucrat or judge or cop can dictate to a mother what she can or cannot do with her body you are really saying that the mother is the slave to the judge or cop or bureaucrat that it is the bureaucrats body and he will instruct the mother on how she may use his property her self 
it is not a question of the babys health the mother has an absolute right to choose what is living inside her and not 
while it is true you cannot kill someone just for trespassing as the punishment must be proportion to the crime the unborn childs life requires that trespass and the mother has an absolute legal right to evict the unborn baby from her body 
neither pro nor anyone else would allow a child to be killed at age three on the grounds of the child being the product of a rape 
if there is an independent which is separate from human rights we must still resolve the conflict between this alleged new right or whatever it is and the rights of the woman and of others in society 
from the viewpoint of society this is a substantially greater injustice than terminating a fertilized egg 
unfertilized eggs sperm and a surgically removed appendix are all because they are all the products of human dna and of nothing else 
pro seeks to have all abortion made illegal including situations in which the fertilized egg is a microscopic undifferentiated sphere of a few hundred cells 
the question then arises as to what is due to a fertilized egg versus what is due to the woman and to others potentially impacted by legislation making abortion illegal 
even if it were accepted that it is unjust to destroy a fertilized egg which i do not grant it is greater injustice to violate the rights of the woman to govern her own body 
a just society should honor the rights of woman above any supposed injustice to fertilized eggs 
that is because there is implicit recognition that fertilized eggs are not human beings and therefore does not give a fertilized egg what is due to a human being 
pro implicitly acknowledges that fertilized eggs are not human beings by providing the exception for rape in his assertion 
there are no movements to develop heroic technologies to save them nor to afford the burial traditions of religions 
when pro grants the exception to allow abortion over concern for the health of the woman pro grants that the woman has a greater right to live than the unborn 
pro illustrates by claiming that there is a right against that exists independent of human rights 
pros standard of was applied to the woman in comparison to the fertilized egg by arguing that the womans right to govern her body could be derive from human nature in the manner that pro claimed to derive a right against dehumanization 
most damaging was pros inclusion of a rape exemption by which makes it abundantly clear that even he acknowledges the substantial inferiority of the egg 
pro again declined to counter the point directly claiming that no right and implicitly no human worth had been established for either the woman or society 
if the extremely narrow definition of human worth proposed by pro is accepted it is then the job of pro to establish that the human worth of a fertilized egg is greater than the human worth of an adult woman 
thus according to the dictionary the fertilized egg is not a human being and the resolution based upon that assumption fails 
 pro used an incorrect definition of and failed to rebut the numerous arguments that even if a fertilized egg were considered a human being that the eggs worth was inferior to humans who had been born 
buy observing the traditions of society we know that society universal treats the death of a fertilized egg in a way much inferior to the death of a human being 
having argued that a fertilized egg was a not a human being and that even if deemed a human being was judged by society to are vastly inferior worth i argued that therefore the rights of the woman and of society should prevail 
thus pro implicitly acknowledged tat by his own standards the proposition maintaining that the egg suffers greater harm fails 
if the fertilized egg is nonetheless maintained to be a human being then society clearly affords it a much inferior worth than that of human that have been born 
this question has long been resolved in favor of human rights being the standard for and not the new standard which pro has proposed 
the impact of the argument with respect to the resolution pertains to whether or not a fertilized egg is a human being 
pro did not rebut the argument that the fact of illegal abortions constitutes greater injustice than making them illegal therefore it stands 
the argument shows that since none of the ceremonies and traditions applied to human beings are applied to fertilized eggs it is therefore clear that society does not consider a fertilized egg to be a human being 
if a fetus and child were human beings of equal status then pro could not possible grant an exception that allowed a fetus to be aborted in the case of rape 
i plainly reasserted human rights as additional value criteria in the evaluation of whether justice is done 
precisely what i asked for was an example of the that has occurred as a traceable consequence of abortion having been legalized for the past fifty years ago 
it is the course of making the argument that pro implicitly acknowledges that there is critical difference between a fetus and a child 
i do however point out that a reasonable interpretation of pros offer is that under those circumstances reason would be allowed to prevail 
pro made the argument that this is not about rights but that argument was rebutted on the grounds that justice cannot be evaluated without general consideration of rights as well as 
no asserting that the standard of human worth applies does not of itself tell us whether the application of the standard to the fertilized egg supersedes its application to the woman 
 the correct definition of is obtained by looking up the phrase which yields 
in any case the cost of these new methods is so high and likely to remain so that the proposition argument is irrelevant the use of ultrasound scanning leading to selective abortion is so much cheaper that this great evil will not be reduced 
the court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and with scarcely any reason or authority for its action invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes 
extend all arguments 
extend all arguments 
would you rather a mother get an abortion by a doctor in an office with all the right equipment or in some old apartment from a shady guy on the street with a pair of tongs 
it takes a physical toll on a person to carry a baby inside of them for nine months then give birth to that baby and then give the baby to another family 
most people argue that adoption is always better than abortion 
if abortion is banned people would not simply change their views on having children 
a child is simply an extension of it is mother 
i accept good luck 
there is no clear and simple answer as to when a babys life starts and neither of us are qualified to make that assumption nor is any other non divine being on this planet 
those women in the first  months will eventually be in their  so why is it worse or better 
what were really arguing about her is weighing why early and late term abortions are different and in reality how ever you tihnk of aboritons they really are not different at all 
as far as health i am not advocating putting an unborn fetus to death because it would be born handicapped but physical and mental abnormalities do not only effect the child the effect the mother as well 
if you are pregnant and your child develops cancer in the womb the longer its in there there is more of a cahnce the cancer spreads to you via blood stream 
a dead person can have a heart beat and brain activity for hours sometimes days after his death does that mean hes still alive 
but the reason abortion is and always should be legal is a matter of the personal right too make a choice 
first of all i make my argument assuming we are both on the same ground about early abortions 
 economics one of the reasons a mother has an abortion is because the father walks out on her or she simply can not afford to have a baby at the time 
my opponent states in certain situations abortion is appropriate but if they are so young and its not rape its there own fault 
out of all the women who have abortions  are unmarried 
teens take up  and women aged   take up the remaining  
as i stated before it should not matter the stage of a fetuss development when an abortion takes place because a fetus is not a living human being until it has been birthed 
it seems though that you are advocating the blatant oppression of women and the nationalization of uteruses 
this assertion is contingent upon the facts that aborted fetuses feel minimal pain and that it should be a womans right to chose what she does with her own body 
well i am telling you that there is rarely a situation in which a woman receives an abortion to which a does not apply 
it is my firm claim that there is nothing morally unjust with receiving an abortion for any case whatsoever 
it is therefore evident that women should hold the inalienable right to receive an abortion at any point 
through this debate you have shown little scientific evidence and have ignored all the reasons a woman would have for receiving an abortion 
and in my initial post i stipulated very clearly that abortion a week before the due date was okay i even went insofar as saying an abortion a day before a due date was okay 
then i pose this question what makes an abortion namely a late term abortion so morally unjust 
in reality the few late term abortionists in the united states utilize the technique mold standing for four drugs misoprostol oxytocin laminaria and digoxin that are injected into a fetus throughout the course of several days 
when late term abortions are attacked as vehemently as they are in the united states i encourage you to look into the murder of late term abortionist george tiller women will do what they need to do to terminate their pregnancy 
let me start by assuring you that i am indeed a clinically sane person 
as i stated in my previous argument women who need abortions will stop at no lengths to get one 
therefore it only makes sense to make sure these abortions are performed in such a professional manner that the fetus does not feel pain and that a woman does not harm herself in trying to perform her own abortion 
 this leads me to my third reason the simple fact of the matter is one cannot prevent a women from getting an abortion for if a women decides for herself that an abortion is the only route to take nothing can stop her from terminating her pregnancy 
people who deny women their right to late term abortions provoke patriarchal tendencies by which men have all the say in a countrys doings and diminish the rights of women 
if such is the case rest assured it is then would not it make sense to give women the safest option possible an abortion 
to win the debate con would need to prove that the law of hindered birth is not a law and he would need to prove that a woman cannot under any circumstances plan to have a child and then have that child 
he has not made one single valid argument to challenge the or to prove that it does not the impact that abortion has on society 
the fact is that all arguments about abortion are impacted in one sense or another by this law 
con has made a normal pro life argument that is of no value to this debate 
as stated above in the first round this debate will test a newly revealed natural scientific law that partially governs the impact that abortion has on society 
it is indisputable that the egg and sperm of the wanted child are simply a wish away from conception 
i have proved that the wanted child is more likely to be born than the unwanted child 
his invalid arguments are  which has no impact because the situation of some women will change 
the law says that forcing one life denies the possibility of another for  months 
it does not matter to the law if the forced fetus is a human and it does not impact the birth of a wanted child 
it says that if one life is forced then another is impossible 
it does not matter if they are in fact the same as adults because any impact on the falls equally on the wanted and unwanted unborn 
saving the unwanted destroys the possibility of the 
the odds of birth for a planned child are nearly  percent and the odds of the unplanned about  percent 
if a person forces the birth of an unwanted fetus then each  conceptions will yield  live children 
the abstract child is not alive this is not part of the debate 
the debate relates to the fact that the wanted child cannot be alive if the unwanted life is forced to birth 
cons major error is that he fails to distinguish between law and theory 
i have proved the unwanted unborn has a  percent chance of life and the wanted unborn has a nearly  percent chance of life 
if a woman wants to have a child in the future she will likely find a mate and try intentionally over and over again to become pregnant with that mate until she is successfully pregnant 
i have proven and con has not successfully disputed that the is true and it follows that the wanted child is much more likely to be born than the unwanted child 
so the proof that a future wanted child will be born is in the fact that people do in fact have wanted children that are born after several attempts 
if the forced fetus is a real living human and is forced into birth the wanted child would still not be born and would lose the opportunity for life 
anyone can see that if a woman is forced to give birth to unwanted tissue she can lose a wanted child 
so forcing the birth of an unwanted child denies life to a wanted child 
one can never say prior to birth that it is a living human because we cannot know if it will remain alive 
so until the day of birth if there is a successful birth we cannot know for certain that the fetus will be a living human 
the only moral and reasonable thing a person can do is to reject the ideas of the pro life movement 
usually a woman will at some time in her life become pregnant with a wanted child and carry that child full term until birth 
 logically speaking if a natural law conflicts with a persons idea then the law would always win out over the idea that is unproven 
as explained earlier dna is like computer code until the code is completely run we cannot be certain that there is a living human 
if the woman conceives a wanted conception then the odds of an actual born child coming from that conception is the same for her with a wanted child as the odds are for an unwanted child 
cons challenge is met the fetus in not a human and the the potential child from the is a living human being 
once a woman has a birth that is successful then and only then has she proven the theory that a wanted child is almost certain 
and even those that agree with con admit that the moment of conception is simply a part of the cycle of life 
but the fact is that the forced fetus is not in fact a living human because we cannot know for sure that it will in fact live to be born 
because women will try over and over again in order to become pregnant and actually give birth a wanted and willing pregnancy will result in a real child even though it is called a potential child 
now the fact is that if there is doubt one should err on the side of the wanted child 
so if a woman is forced to give birth to an unwanted fetus then she would not likely be able to become pregnant with a mate of her choice for at least  months 
so by forcing birth and denying them the opportunity to become pregnant for  months with their lovers child con would be denying life for at least that long plus the time it takes to conceive 
and during that  months she would be forced to give birth to an unwanted fetus and the life of a child of her choice would be denied 
the reason saving the wanted fetus is the least harmful path is because we know for certain that there will likely be a wanted birth and there is little chance that an unwanted conception will be born 
it is a common stated belief of the pro life community that if we are not certain if something is in fact life then we should take the least harmful path 
this is the issue to be debated if a woman is forced to carry to term one fetus then she cannot normally become pregnant with another fetus in the same time period 
of course if that is true then she probably does not want to be pregnant with the unwanted child either 
likewise cons second point fails in that the as presented makes it clear that forcing the birth of one child stops the potential of another child 
and most women throughout history have been able to find a mate and have children when they want all of cons points fail 
she may be forced to go on public assistance and thousands of other reasons that will because her to fail to have a child of her choice 
the changes everything prior to the law it was unclear that a life was being traded for a life 
the fact that a woman has never been able to become pregnant with a second child while already pregnant with another child does not mean that the does not exist 
so the sensible thing to do is to save the wanted fetus and not let it be killed in the process of saving of the unwanted fetus 
even if cons point that it is not a real life is taken as true and it is not true the fact is that the option of a real life being denied creation is still a fact 
if con can prove that all women are lying when they say they want a child by their lover and not their rapist he may have a point 
but we are not dealing with a single death out of  conceptions we are dealing with  deaths compared to  live births for each  conceptions 
con does not take into account the obvious fact that the dna could be a self writing program or a set of blueprints with hidden details 
if is a self writing program and dna is simply the tablet upon which life writes then the first instance of dna may not contain the entire code of the human being 
for those reasons alone it is clear that cons arguments that it is life at conception and that the life that is there is human life and not human tissue cannot be true 
so we truly are speaking of when we speak of conceptions embryos fetuses or anything until there is an actual living human baby 
we know that the material that is in the dna existed before conception and is a mixture of dna of the parents 
we can say with confidence that if the dna is so flawed that a non human species would be the result that species would not be born but naturally aborted 
i think we have met the concerns of con as it relates to whether or not we know for certain that any one specific unborn zef is or is not a human 
so we have proven that it is impossible to know if a child will be born until the there are no genetic flaws and a birth occurs 
first and foremost it assumes that the dna is a total package that mediates and creates a completely new human life by some unstated method 
at this stage of scientific knowledge no person can say they understand what it is about dna and life that make the two linked 
we know that the dna at conception is subjected to complex processes we do not fully understand and over which generates a more fully divergent offspring 
therefore it is impossible to know if a conception will become a human life until the code is completely run and there is a live birth 
con admits that humans are born of humans and that there is no reason to believe that will not always be the case 
now if a person is honest he can see that even if one birth out of  was known to die then those  initial conceptions are in fact humans not real humans 
no person knows the mechanisms that operate in the reading of the blueprint or code that drives the dna to divide in meiosis and replicate in mitoses 
of all conceptions as many as  die within the first two weeks another  of the remaining conceptions die in the next  to  weeks and of those remaining another  percent die between week  and  and of the those living to the second trimester another  percent die and finally in the third trimester another  percent die 
i end this debate by pointing out that pro has largely failed to counter my arguments and has made little effort to truly refute my counters 
after this i went on to mention the final poll as it is the one referenced when pro stated most people thought abortion was murder 
preface as this is the final round i shall not make any cases rather i shall make only counter cases 
he has largely made his points through use of unapologetic semantics play and misrepresentation of my own arguments 
  it in no way reference a which I have in a prior round pointed out is a dangerous and possibly hypocritical concept when used to justify violence 
counter case iv shifting the goal post this is a small point and thus will not be a long counter case however i feel i should give it it is own place simply to emphasis the point 
pro starts by attempting to say that i ignored all of his polls except for the one where murder is less 
so the changing from murder to maiming does not alter the validity of my cases 
but in the real world you get a trial no matter what you have done 
pro has failed to counter me usually dropping cases and failed to defend his points 
near the end pro attempted to shift the goal post to discredit my arguments 
ultimately as pro fails to mention any other ones i cannot explain them as each example would be obviously different 
counter case iii semantics pro starts his final paragraph by attempting to discredit me through the use of simple semantics 
simply saying over and over that personal belief that abortion is immoral justification of murdering someone is not a full enough substantiation especially since pro fails to properly show that any reasonable number of people agree with him outside of trying to say that their beliefs support him even though they themselves claim their beliefs to not 
while it is true that most people are still in favour of death penalty the fact that a substantial percentage of people are against it throws doubt into the morality of killing anyone as a punishment 
preface i will start this round by pointing out that pro has completely ignored every case I have made outside of my remarks about his sources 
we cannot fall into the belief that simply because we think something is wrong that we can murder others for it 
pro tries to insinuate that the  whom consider it taking a human life are to be include in those who consider it murder 
the problem here is that books are not acceptable sources unless he presents a specific part of the book as you can not expect the voters to honestly read through two books to get the meaning 
if they are against the death penalty why would they support murdering an abortionist especially without a trial 
the half who do not consider abortion murder must be explained as wrong 
lastly on this note I will remind pro that we cannot perform executive actions as we are not legally permitted enforcers such as police 
if the courts do not provide sentencing then no punishment can be provided and any act of punishment would be a crime in and of itself and allowing such a crime would be a horrifying precedence that should not be allowed 
therefore it is not an appropriate action for someone to act out as they perceive it without a trial 
if asked certainly no citizen will argue with the phrase but once you go into detail that is where you will find that people would not extend this to include murdering someone whom they are likely to themselves consider more or less innocent 
pro goes on to mention that these murders saved innocent lives however many of these women would likely have just went elsewhere to acquire their abortions and many could argue that saving one innocent life by killing another innocent life as the is not a binding or even detailed law of any sort is ultimately still worse as the murder will gravely hurt those who knew the doctor 
  that aside few people would ever agree to the blatant murder of others for an act which many do not consider wrong 
in order to make the right choice we must not make the mistake of allowing an appeal to emotion to cloud our judgement 
while my opponent may consider mentioning peoples moralities as an appeal to popularity as I am referencing that most are against his views however appeal to popularity is informal and it is fully acceptable to mention it when we are referencing the general view of the nation 
we have seen many other times with places such as ferguson mo that we already have a precarious situation with people openly defying law in violent manners that last thing we need is to push deeper 
pro mentions a woman who spoke up about being made to keep the child however this is again an appeal to emotion and does not answer for the fact that in an alternate version where the woman did not keep the child she is likely to also be just as happy 
part  we would not limit ourselves to legal and educational remedies that might possibly stop the bloodshed in the future rather we would take the immediate action necessary to save one another 
closing statement i end this round by reiterating that we must bear in mind the dangerous precedence set in the idea that we can or in pros words must act in a violent and illegal manner even resorting to murder based on our personal interpretation of morality 
if we consider something to be justified under our own personal interpretation of this then we can do it 
certainly these people would not support murder of the doctor as they do not consider his actions amoral 
opponents may bring in the fact that the bible also ordains a genocide to make room for the jews 
if questioned we would assert the moral necessity of taking this action 
for instance the death penalty could condemn an innocent man to death and abortions could help an unexpected mother by getting rid of a baby that they are just not prepared to have for a number of reasons 
also consider if the actions of the two consenting parties do not directly harm anyone besides the consenting parties how can that be considered immoral 
if a fetus consents to the abortion it should not be considered immoral 
unlike china the us is not able to simply harvest the organs of prisoners nor the dead without their consent 
studies by university of california found that  of the women who are turned away from abortion are likely to become unemployed on welfare compared to the  that have abortions 
john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that 
us constitution  amendmenta lot of people site the constitution for the but the constiutional fact is that you have to be born in the united states in order for these rights to apply to you 
a child that is not wanted and one that would because massive harm as well as dettremental effects to soceity should not have to be born into this world as it would simply just because everyone pain 
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge theprivileges orimmunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any statedeprive any person of life liberty or property without dueprocess of law nordeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws 
 on top of this the cdc reports that  of all pregnancies are unintended 
many people tend to site gun control or many other factors but the real solution was abortion 
they are also more likely to stay with their abusive partner leading to a higher amount of domestic violence 
so even though it may or may not be alive it is not considered a us citizen hence have constitutional rights until they are born not at conception 
this is something that no one men women or children have to be forced to live through 
the us constitution prescribes a system of separation of powers and checks and balances for the smooth functioning of all the three branches of the federal government 
the removal of an embryo or fetusfrom the uterus in order to end a pregnancy 
i would like to thank harrytruman for accepting this debate 
a violation of any of the above rules shall result in an automatic forfeiture of the person who violated the rules 
the federal government has three branches i the legislature which is the us congress ii executive comprised of the president and vice president of the us and iii judiciary 
my study was one that actually observed the two events in actions and studied them while my opponent just pulled numbers from random 
rule violationwith this debate end i would like to remind you that my opponent has violated the rules by arguing in round one 
of course you would get arrested since you broke chinese law and the us would arrest you and turn you over to the chinese 
my opponent stated that the  amendment protects persons but he never actually defines what a person is 
with this being the first round i shall go over everything for this debate and then close it out 
all points extended 
even though these points say abortion is not as horrible as it could be if it put women in danger it is still basically killing people which pro apparently agrees with since they did not counter either of my points on fetal personhood and bodily autonomy 
i assume pro would counter that fetuses do not have moral value but they have done a pretty bad job of defending that by ignoring the point altogether 
i guess i win this point by default since pro did not even try to counter me 
if pro is going to start making excuses like then what about dead people 
 akmath has also moved the goalposts of this debate though i must admit i got caught up in it a bit as well focusing a lot on when life begins and the viability of fetuses rather than the issue at hand whether legalized abortion has done more good than harm 
it would not really matter if what the sperm are doing is moral since in this example they are not sentient yet but still have the rights of babies 
 compared to states that support women s health those states that oppose safe and legal abortion spend far less money per child on a range of services such as foster care education welfare and the adoption of children who have physical and mental disabilities so they are saving money 
however it is the principle of the matter that counts so for the sake of agreement let us say the bomb will blow up one person 
however the sperm in this case are competing for a common resource they would all need to become sentient ex people competing for food and do not automatically have the right to it in the way that people do with the suns rays 
you argue that abortion only endangers the lives of   women and that it decreased 
 it would not be fair to force him to die over this and it would not be fair to force someone to get blown up when they have  responsibility in the matter 
pro says that the example would be applicable if joe invited the terrorist into his house which would mean women could not get an abortion in cases where they consent to sex 
in fact pro has only defended bodily autonomy in the case of rape where it means either the mother or the fetus will die 
in one case something is naturally developing whereas in the other one a sperm is actively taking a resource for itself 
 if the terrorist as terrorists often do forced his or her way into the space station and used violence to place this bomb in joes hand surely it would not be fair to force him to die over this 
in other words since the sperm all depend on fertilizing the egg in order to become sentient it is not immoral for them to fertilize it 
saying joe is allowed to do this is basically saying it is fine to allow terrorists to set up bomb triggers on your property and then set them off yourself so long as the reason you are killing someone is to save your life 
if there is excess food and one person hoards it all to themselves it is immoral 
 this is more comparable to abortion in cases of rape than agreeing to donate a kidney because with abortion and the above situation the person forfeiting bodily autonomy had bad luck which led to the other persons problem rather than the other way around 
if someone let us call him joe owned his own space station and terrorists rigged a bomb in and said the station that would blow up new york if he opened the door he would not have the right to do so since it was his responsibility to keep his property safe in the first place 
good since infanticide does not because more good than harm if the above exhibits are seen as convincing then abortion should likewise be viewed as a net loss for society 
the one reason i give not debated by pro is that they ought not be treated as persons so we can exterminate them for population control 
pro has argued with absolutely no evidence for his claims 
i have proven through the historical examples of hitlers nazi regime and the case of rwandan genocide that human rights is not the result of social structures from 
this is a debate and you cannot dispute fact with your personal feelings 
i gave a reason whether good or not why babies should not be treated as a person 
babies ought to be not treated as persons because they are not persons and do not have human rights 
you may feel that it not worthy to argue but as a debater you must engage in debate because it is my argument which you fail to counter 
 the babes in question ought not be treated as persons i say this is false 
since i proved that human rights does not result from social structures in the con should win this argument 
 absolutely i never claimed that they did have to contradiction you said 
again social structures are in place but that did not stop mass extermination 
this is a real wide problem that you have not taken the time to argue at all except by saying that you do not or it is moral 
respectfully your personal feelings just are not relevant to the truth that abortion is a sure way of population control 
the problem is not that i do not believe in human rights 
the problem is you failed in your definition of human rights based in nature 
how many times have you seen a child share without the prompting of a parent or teacher 
but as discussed in my earlier argument hitler sought out what was best for himself 
you obviously do not deny that there is a population problem or else you would have stated it 
i will return to the population control argument that i offered in round  
or a toddler in the grocery store throwing a huge fit because the child does not get what he wants 
i would argue for both i give you credit for that addition that helps my argument 
you obviously do not deny that this population problem is causing a depletion of our resources 
more natural to humans is selfishness 
to control population i would say abort and have safe sex 
second let me state that personally i agree with the pro side but for the sake of debate i will try to argue the con side 
are they a person and should they be excluded from human rights 
what about individuals that have mental retardation or people who are brain damaged i guess to what degree would be of debate 
first is appears that you are defining a as someone who has 
should animals have and be regarded as a according to this defintion 
i urge voters to judge not with their emotions but on logic and the arguments presented 
if this is the case then i would argue that the pro has a flawed definition of a 
my adversary claims that abortion should not be legal as we can see by the topic 
she then changes the resolution so that abortion should support cases where it could because danger to someone 
therefore extend all resolutions because she conceded that should should be legal in some circumstances and because of the remaining points that were dropped 
none of this evidence follows or aligns with almost any other scientific research done on this subject while a fetus may be a life it does not start to develop characters that humans share until around   weeks 
so if we took pros stance and actually considered the fetus a human we are promised by law the right to terminate it if it could endanger the mothers life 
even recent studies show that pregnancy is actually more fatal now than it was years ago the maternal death rate in the you s is creeping upward to more than double what it was  years ago 
the next logical question one may ask is whether or not it is a human life 
i would almost argue for the fact that the fetus would have to exhibit pain feelings emotion and conscious 
my adversary will surely spend some of his her allotted words on presenting the fact that a fetus is a life at conception 
i think this exhibits some flaws in logic because the next logical step that my adversary would take is that killing this person or baby after the time it was conceived would be murder 
this is a difficult circumstance to be put in but with the child having no way to respond in both situations the only viable way to judge this is let the parents decide 
i am not going to spend much time on this because it is overall irrelevant to some of the points i will be making 
justifiable homicide rightful warranted or sanctioned by law that which can be shown to be sustained by lawwe are also by law promised the right to act in self defense 
if this is an early term pregnancy and we know for a fact that if the pregnancy continued the mother would die 
there is a big problem with this and it is cited and acknowledged by multiple people a if the pregnancy continues the mother will die 
imagine if you are with a girl for  years and at the age of  she encounters this situation 
these are just a few facts on how many pregnancies can be fatal 
 anand argues that because fetuses can respond to stress or other stimuli at  weeks abortion after that point causes them 
 a a fetus is a life and it was conceived by a human therefore the fetus is a person or a baby 
contention  in cases where it could danger a mother s lifefor the sake of argument let us say that a fetus is in fact a living breathing person and acting on abortion is committing murder 
here in lies the inherent contradiction that you have failed to address and side stepped by dismissing it as irrelevant when it is if the woman aborts it is the only case that is not considered murder 
so as the i am the in this debate i am respectfully asking to see what the laws of australia in terms of abortion and what the punishment is for someone who kills the baby of a pregnant woman 
elizabith wilkes examining the marital laws in ny state in  she has all the rights of income and property as if she were unmarried excepting marriage 
the issue as to why abortions are evil is based on the fact that killing a human is murder 
but we have this law called the right to life and i do not think we should make accpetions or give power to any individual to decided who is worthy of being a human and who is not in our society 
if a man deliberately hits a woman in the stomach surprisingly it fits the definition thus it would be applicable to argue this point 
 my opponent stated that only under the law he had provided does killing a fetus is considered as killing 
your argument is not it is about protecting the life of the child 
it is all wrong and there should be no acceptions 
furthermore we have the ability to look beyond the laws of our countries and turn to science for some objectivity since I have proven that the laws are hypocritical on this subject 
the reason why abortion is wrong is because the baby is not seen as a living human even though science agrees that it is a living human 
here is the truth this website properly cites scientific studies conclusions  no matter what the condition of the mother is the child is innocent and does not deserve to die 
since the child is a living being as i have proven abortion is therefore murder 
i would argue that its highly immoral to grant such power over another human life as to define it as a living thing or not based solely on a decision whatever the decision may be 
in essence if a man hits a woman in the womb and kills the fetus regardless of the stage he will be tried for not one but possibly two accounts of murder depending on the mothers health 
if the woman wants child support and decides to come after the man she is more than likely if he is not disabled awol or dead going to get it 
the reason behind the making of crime does not validate the reason for why abortion should be a crime 
and personally it was horrific to see a baby squirming for its life when a vacuum was ripping it to pieces from inside do not mean an emotional appeal to be the foundation of my argument but i find that some merit can be drawn from this if you want to google it and see what I have seen 
another classic contradiction is if a fetus survives the abortion it is then considered a human life and people have to try to save its life under the born alive infants act 
but if you get pregnant then it should be seen as a responsibility to at least deliver the child and set it up for adoption if you do not want it 
and to the contrary i would argue men were seen as tools to a higher degree than that of women 
essentially if a mother wants to abort it for any reason she chooses then its not a human 
the man does not have the right to self preservation and is forced to work to support the mother and child on their terms 
yes the property did in fact go to the man but the man had to legally provide a standard of living suitable to the family 
women have abortions to choose when to have children based on their age financial stability and relationship stability 
it is quite heart breaking that so many women die during legal abortions but if abortions were illegal it would not stop them and women seeking an abortion would find one by unsafe and illegal means so it is best to provide a safe and legal means of abortion 
it is not the governments position to legislate against womens choices 
adopting is not always a smart idea statistics show that a number of children that are adopted become destructive mentally 
a fetus does not become human until the  or  week 
it is no different that stepping on a spider or cutting down a tree 
however my opponent has not shown the idea that government control causes stagnation to be a general fact nor has con shown that government control of abortion specifically would because stagnation or a diminishing of quality con simply provided examples of failed governmental projects from countries like yugoslavia and east germany both of which were communist states that by no means resemble the united states 
conclusiontoday we have had an opponent who has failed to prove that his solution of letting the free market manage abortion would be superior to a government funded solution 
 in addition when we build government clinics in places with fewer clinics we because private businesses to also expand into these areas to capture the sales that the government is siphoning from their existing places 
in countries like britain the nhs uses less money than its private counterparts but still maintains a similar standard of care showing that government controlled services could work out very well 
some people disagree with funding the military because they think it is immoral to fund wars 
the nearest abortion clinic is a few hundred miles away in another city another city that you cannot travel to considering the fact that your car has been repossessed 
however in the status quo abortion clinics can be hard to find in some areas such as mississippi or north dakota and state legislatures are constantly trying to pass new bills that would make abortion clinics even rarer 
in our world when women have too little access to abortion clinics because they are not close enough to where they live tragedies like this happen in places with harsh regulations on abortion abortion clinics might not even be built forcing women to travel elsewhere to end unwanted pregnancies 
with abortions mothers lives could be saved from complications that would otherwise arise from continuing on with the pregnancy such as severe infections heart disease or stroke 
 diy abortions are harmful to the health of women because they are not conducted by trained professionals and are often unsanitary 
this means that many women wishing to have an abortion would have to travel long distances to get one which makes abortions practically inaccessible for poorer women who cannot afford such travel the same women who abortions would likely benefit 
signpost in order to demonstrate why my proposal must be put in place i first demonstrate that abortions benefit society and then analyse why knowing that we must use this proposal to make it more accessible 
a sperm requires a specific set of circumstances to become a living human but then so does a foetus it has to remain inside a uterus and to be provided with nutrients and a bunch of other conditions 
i think a case could be made in many cases after  weeks too but i see no need to pursue such a case as the wording of the motion is that we should ban all abortions I am happy to concede after  weeks 
the foetus is no more capable of developing into a living human vy itself than the sperm is both require a female body to turn them into a living human 
however the motion still fails as before  weeks the foetus is not capable of suffering in any meaningful way how can you justify giving something which is not conscious and is unable to suffer in any way that even superecede the rights of a live conscious woman 
the crux of the argument so far seems to come down to this we agree that before  weeks a foetus is not capable of suffering in any meaningful way and is not conscious 
on the right to life it is undeniable that before  weeks after fertilisation the foetus cannot be said to be conscious or sentient 
even if we accept pros studies and we ought not to there are a number of things which correlate to a higher chance of depression and cancers drinking alcohol being a prime example 
assuming pros stat of  weeks is valid and frankly I am not qualified to say whether it is or not then  of abortions occur when the foetus does not have a central nervous sytem of any kind and therefore is not conscious and therefore is incapable of suffering in any meaningful way 
we should also consider the health effects of someone not having an abortion 
asterisks nb the statistics on source  are listed in terms of weeks after gestation not fertilization 
if we were to take that claim to its logical progression we would have to observe that sperm and egg cells are also capable of becoming a living human 
pregnancies also correlate with a risk of cancers due to forcing the body to rapidly to accomodate the foetus 
i can not think of any more terms which will likely need defining but if i do I will define such terms in my later speeches 
I would like to wish my opponent good luck and thank them and the readers for their attention 
central nervous system a group of organs mainly the brain and spinal cord which are made primarily of neutrones 
it is irresponsible to ignore any of the above reasons 
if you disagree post why and I will tell you why i disagree with your opinion and vise versa 
tay sachs is a prebirth testable disease that is when the child is incapable of breaking down fats in his her brain causing death before the child is  and retardation earlier  
once one has been  months pregnant i believe it is too late to abort but again i say it must be an option 
abortion needs to stay an option because of the reasons i listed above 
every thing i say is most serious 
i will argue that people who are against abortion are anti choice not pro life and my opponent will argue that they are pro life not anti choice 
i will wait for my opponent to respond to this claim with their counter arguement 
fetuses can t feel any pain during abortions nor are they at all aware of their surroundings or what is happening 
poor mothers would have to see their child hungry and living a life in poor conditions simply because the mother wanted to keep the child 
  other situations as many agree on rape is a case where abortion should be allowed especially since the child could grow up knowing that she was never intended and was the result of a crime 
death from childbirth is more common than one would expect 
also adoption also has its own problems with bad families and even poor facilities at the adoption home another place where the child would suffer 
in those cases would it not be better to let the child go or rather have the child suffer living a life of confusion regret and feelings of unwantedness 
the points i gave above only supported abortion when the womans or the childs life is in danger 
and if not why are you arguing with me when I am merely arguing that the fetus should be prioritized 
the limit i believe is that the mother if she does opt to have an abortion a practice i do not support should have the abortion early in the first trimester 
in conclusion a mother sometimes has the right to have her wishes of an abortion supported rather than the life of the infant 
i already stated in the comments which you seemed to either ignore or not understand that the word sometimes threw off the resolution and implied that any single argument from either side would fulfill the resolution 
of course there is a risk but even people who could not support a child still want to have sex and if she gets pregnant we cannot get mad at her for wanting to have sex 
also in case you did not know there are many mothers who feel too much shame to want to give their child up for adoption so that is not always a viable options for other reasons i stated previously 
if a mother or parents cannot handle a child why force them to have it simply to satisfy the people who do not believe in abortion 
in addition killing a child outside of the womb is murder inside the womb is abortion 
before that in the womb it does not show enough qualities of a full human being to regard it as such which is a reason why abortion is allowed 
what i meant was financially poor woman as in not enough money or resources to support the child 
what i understood from it was that an accident like a car crash happened and the person became attached to you 
i assume he is arguing about later in the pregnancy since that was my focus 
so are you implying that woman should not be having sex since they run the risk of getting pregnant 
i asked for an opponent that was for abortions but against killing them outside the womb 
i say it is a techincal difference so the doctor should just kill it right then outside of the womb 
or if we want to add some level of respectiviblity assuming putting the baby back in and then killing it would not count as to respectability 
or we could wait a few days or weeks if the baby is viable until a govenor gives the okay and then kill it 
if you take theology out of the argument there is simply no need for any govt involvement in the process beyond quality assurance 
before that it is a fetus with no rights civil or otherwise 
according to common law and tradition in the western world life begins when a baby takes it is first breath 
does a human life begin at birth 
if there is anyone who is actually pro abortion I have never seen or heard of them 
there are some things that are beyond the purview of any government 
i would turn the question around to my opponent if the child will experience no suffering due to an early abortion why make the rape victim suffer 
thus in regards to the other two cases namely in cases of severe genetic or developmental deformities to save the child from sufferingexample a child who is developing in the womb with organs on the outside of its body and its prognosis were it to live would be an excruciating child birth followed by no more than a day or two of life consisting of constant pain and suffering 
you are then forced into a lengthy and expensive court battle to try and get the child into adoption 
i invite my opponent to fill in the argument with additional premises in order to make the argument valid 
my opponent has adamantly held to the following argument premise  the unborn child is not at fault for the rapepremise  an abortion does not change history and because the rape to have not occurredpremise  an unborn child morally deserves the chance to liveconclusion in cases of rape aborting an unborn child is completely immoralthis argument is not valid as the conclusion does not logically follow from the truth of the premises 
 i would like to now focus attention onto my opponents arguments against the third case i presented in cases of rape 
 my opponent seems to have a misunderstanding of how often rapists actually stand trial 
specifically premise  an unborn child morally deserves the chance to livepremise  a rape victim morally deserves to be freed of being retraumatized by the rapepremise  being forced to carry the rapists child results in daily retraumatizing the rape victimthereforepremise  a rape victim morally deserves not to be forced to carry the rapists childpremise  the only way for the unborn child to live is for the mother to carry the child to termpremise  for a rape victim to not be forced to carry the rapists child she must have the choice to abort the childtherefore premise  premise  and premise  are incompatible and it is impossible for both moral requirements to be metpremise  in the case of conflicting moral requirements the moral choice is the one which results in the least human sufferingpremise  aborting a child before it has developed a nervous system a brain any consciousness or means of experiencing existence results in no human sufferingpremise  forcing a mother to carry the rapists child can result in daily and extreme human sufferingtherefore from    and  conclusion the moral choice is to allow the mother the option of aborting the child while still undeveloped which would result in zero suffering by the child and would prevent great suffering by the motherthis argument is valid as the conclusion logically follows from the premises 
in comparison a child aborted before it gains any nervous system brain or means of experience would not suffer at all 
I have already spoken at length about how the trauma of being forced to carry the child could harm the rape victim many times more than the rape itself 
in the cases where the birth of the child would because immense suffering or death to othersthis scenario pertains the the debate as it is another example of a situation in which abortion is moral 
i agree with my opp that cognitive behavioural therapy cbt is a great and proven method of dealing with post traumatic stress disorder and is often used with both war veterans and rape victims to help them heal from the trauma they have experienced 
if she loses the battle and he gets custody then for the rest of her life her rapist could intrude into her life at his whim 
the lack of control and hopelessness of ever having freedom would and does force many to suicide 
you are then forced into a lengthy and expensive court battle to try and get the child into adoption 
in those societies in those times if a parent truly believed that the birth of their child would bring suffering or death to others then i assert that it was moral for them to abort the child 
namely a abortion does not change the fact that the rape happened however not having the abortion continues to traumatize the rape victim daily for months or years potentially harming the woman exponentially more than the rape act itself 
if a mothers children or loved ones were being held hostage and the hostage taker threatened to kill them all unless she aborted the baby she was carrying then i do not believe it would be wrong of her to abort her child to save those she loved 
for example a family acquaintance of mine learned that the fetus in her womb had organs that were growing on the outside of its body 
the parent can not be held accountable for what we know now is faulty science and should actually be commended for making a huge sacrifice for what they truly believed to be the greater good 
would aborting the baby change history and totally erase the rape in every way shape and form 
in the cases where the birth of the child would because immense suffering or death to othersi m adding a third scenario in which abortion would be moral 
if a parent completely believed these predictions were true then i cannot fault them for deciding to abort a child in order to save those around them 
there were some situations in which through the trusted method of divination it was determined that if a particular child were allowed to be born it would bring death destruction or great suffering on a community 
this one is not very applicable in the present day but applies more when we are looking back through history at choices made in the past 
however forcing a woman to carry that child to term has the potential to traumatize her on a scale much greater than the actual rape itself 
i argue that in this instance it is most moral to make the choice that causes the least suffering 
in cases of rapemy opponents questions are valid and i will answer each is it the unborn babys fault the woman got raped 
the mother elected to spare her child that suffering and had an abortion 
i have laid out three cases in which abortion would be moral without the mothers life being threatened  in cases of severe genetic or developmental deformities to save the child from sufferingexample a child who is developing in the womb with organs on the outside of its body and its prognosis were it to live would be an excruciating child birth followed by no more than a day or two of life consisting of constant pain and suffering 
 in cases of rapemy opponent has spent the majority of his time arguing against this case 
unfortunately my opponent has blatantly refused to discuss the arguments i have presented instead dismissing them as cop outs 
so in essence you have no logical reason you are simply deferring to a book 
since one cannot reasonably apply their own personal religious ideals to the whole of humanity i believe you have failed to make your case 
you have not offered a single reason as to why it is wrong other than 
reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life sometimes described as an or iv 
 if you cannot care for a child you can choose the following  not to have sex  prevent fertilization  adoption 
intent to inflict grievous bodily harm short of death iii 
 even if you say there is no harm done in this logic there is nothing wrong with killing a person in a coma 
i suggest that one or more of you vote the s g point and specifically point out that she could boldface quoted material or start the first line of quoted material with a colon or otherwise take pains to distinguish quoted material from new material 
what i think it means my best and most charitable interpretation is that it means the sperm cell is not a person 
let us say pro is saying that after three months if we leave the poc alone and let it develop in a natural way it may eventually with some luck get born 
a better solution not good but far less damaging than that proposed by pro would be to let certified infertile women choose one single fertile woman and get a court order forcing her to have children and then surrender them 
 not all women are comfortable with fertility treatments and would rather just adopt a baby they can raise as their own 
I have raised this personhood issue myself and pro seems to be agreeing that it is important but she is not tying it to her arbitrary three month limit 
and even if we were going to abuse ourselves and our society by pretending that such things do have rights this would have nothing to do with pros arbitrary three month limit 
 while pros arbitrary three month rule serves no purpose that she cares to name it would do enormous harm to individual lives and to american freedom 
there is no reason for us to impute opinions to them like or or 
but it is okay there is no problem with it because they do not have any opinions 
this test fails to draw a line at three months it produces cells at a mass rate 
even pro is okay with killing pocs before three months 
it is true even of an egg and sperm cell in a womb together 
none of them would support her arbitrary three month limit even if they did survive inspection 
not all women are comfortable with being forced to have babies for other women they would rather not have children at all or not have children until they want them for themselve 
since her s g is worse than mine voting s g points is permissible 
but presumably science will eventually fix that so even a baby that has to be taken from the womb at one month can survive 
pro has conceded that the resolution is false 
but even if you want to count that mention without link as a source she did not use that source in a way that helped her case 
the various rationales one way you can recognize when you are in the wrong is this if you find yourself flailing around grasping and abandoning one rationale after another then you probably do not have a real justification for your position 
there is no point no utility to pretending they do 
and even if that is your true motive why should one woman get to force another woman to have a baby for her 
 most women that cannot conceive are looking to adopt a newborn if we passed a law such as this they are would be more babies for those women 
we can not assume that those women could have abortions no more than we can assume that your proposed victims can give their kids up for adoption 
I am pro abortion but there is absolutely no reason to assume the victims of those scientists were pro abortion 
 abortions should only be allowed before the end of the womens first trimester the first  months after the first three months the only option for the unborn child should be adoption 
i doubt that your belief is based on the thousands of women who can not conceive 
would you change your mind about abortion if new fertility treatments fixed them 
 this is my belief because there are thousands of women who cannot conceive and some are grief stricken for that reason 
the embryo is not a person there is nobody to punish 
state your case 
florynce r kennedy  
you have done this deed in secret but i will bring it about in the presence of all israel and with the sun looking down 
as we can see he orders abortion and murder all the time  its widely accepted if not by all chirstians that aborted children souls go to heaven 
you can not punch someone in the face while telling them not punch people in the face because its wrong  chirstians are not being taught the bible correctly or they would have to believe god ordered women to have an abortion 
samuel    killing more children wrong hosea   every pregnant woman here gets a divine abortion those are just a few examples of god going crazy with murder and abortion 
to further my point god has no regard for life he consistently has people killed or killed them himself but for some reason chirstians are being taught humans are special and god values all life 
 wrong next we headed for the land of bashan where king og and his army attacked us at edrei 
the fact he has ordered the death of unborn children its reasonable to say god ordered the woman to have the abortion as part of his divine plan 
abortion must be part of gods will if he created you with plans to have the abortion 
if god created all of us and already knows what were going to choose and do because he created it all that way 
god has a divine plan that he made before any of us were alive  
so if it is a sin and all sins are the same why is it so bad to sin be forgiven and have your child directly go to heaven 
the souls of aborted children still get to go to heaven and be with god 
it is said in the bible if you sin and ask for forgiveness no matter what the sin is you will be saved and forgiven 
it also states we were all born sinners and need to accept jesus as our savior to get into heaven 
i do not understand why christians are so against abortion when the soul of the aborted child widely accepted by the christians goes to heaven 
therefore abortion is probably the single best thing any christian can to for their child if the ultimate goal is getting into heaven to be with god 
having an abortion instead of delivering the child ensures your childs soul will end up in heaven 
tens of thousands of women have heart disease kidney disease severe hypertension sickle cell anemia and severe diabetes and other illnesses that are made worse by childbearing 
even a preteen knows that she should be on some sort of birth control if they are having sex 
i believe even for a high risk surgery women no matter the age should have the final say on what is to be done to their own bodies 
patients are able to go home the same day after an abortion and do not require much to recover 
any surgical process that a person may need or want even if it means life or death if the person does not want it performed on their body they should be forced to 
the parent should be aware of any procedure that their child is having done but the child herself should be able to make final decisions about her own body 
now i do believe that teenagers should have the ability to have an abortion without parental consent 
you are not doctor house 
whoever has the courage to be reminded of a horrible incedent every day of her life when she looks at the one thing that she thought would ever matter to her 
if a mother is not at risk of death then of course she has every right to abort the pregnancy 
if the mother is at risk of death as before she has every right to abort the pregnancy 
it seems unclear why you are intrested in this subject seeing as it will always be the mothers decision and you will never have a say in her choices 
the fetus is not a child yet abortion is not killing a child because the child is self reliant in respect to absorbing nutrients necessary for growth and development while the fetus is not 
if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy existing because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy and this is true 
as long as the fetus is relying on the mother for nutrients to grow and develop for birth the fetus cannot be removed safely from the protection of the mothers body without dying so there is no way for this to happen 
 note for voters if you already read and understand my first arguments completely then skip these next paragraphs well the child could not live without the mother it needs all of those nutrients in order to live so removing the fetus would result in its death 
if a mothers life can be saved because the fetus is draining her of too many nutrients inducing labor or removing the fetus would also because the fetus to die just as in abortion so you have contradictory points there 
if the baby was at a point where it could survive then the mother would not have to worry about adverse health conditions relating to pregnancy would exist because they would have appeared much earlier in the pregnancy 
there is no way to safely remove a fetus when it is still growing and developing because if there was and trust me on this no one would ever get an abortion again unless they were raped 
 note for voters if you already read and understand my first arguments completely then skip these next paragraphs if a mothers life can be saved because the fetus is draining her of too many nutrients inducing labor or removing the fetus would also because the fetus to die just as in abortion so you have contradictory points there 
the fetus is not a child yet abortion is not killing a child because the child is self reliant in respect to absorbing nutrients necessary for growth and development while the fetus is not 
as long as the fetus is relying on the mother for nutrients to grow and develop for birth the fetus cannot be removed safely from the protection of the mothers body without dying so there is no way for this to happen 
just because you are offended at the mother getting an abortion or you do not agree with her getting an abortion does not mean you can outlaw it or that you are right

abortion whether therapeutic or illegal is in the main no longer dangerous because it is being done well by physicians 
good luck on the next phase of the tourney 
let us take a look at the bear scenario my opponent gave in  where one man mistakes a person for a bear thus shooting him and killing him accidentally 
about my nyt source please note that the who did a research in countries where abortion is illegal where they found out that  million unsafe abortions are performed per year  of those women die and between   million of these risky abortions result in long term damage or illnesses 
in a utilitarianist view we need to consider on what is morally permissible and we must consider what the best interest of the mother and child is 
relating to abortion if we outlaw most abortions and when a woman and her doctor think they are killing a non viable being they would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter but it is hard to judge someone criminally negligent for not personally believing that a pre sentient embryo is a viable person when we do not actually know this to be the case 
there are also cases where women are morons they are promiscuous and do not know the outcomes of having sex we should not let the woman and the baby suffer 
now even though we can say that the benefit of the doubt will go life we still would not consider this action to become a killing of an innocent person i e murder 
 million per year this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion this process is more dangerous expensive and of course unlawful  
do you want children to live in the streets to suffer and live with abusive parents 
if we are following pro s logic on embryo being humans then abortion would be tragic and lethal and should result to murder in all cases there should be no exceptions meaning that this will result to many bad consequences 
rebuttal re fetus human again all my opponent has argued here is that the potential life inside the woman s womb is part of the species homo sapiens and that it will evolve and eventually become a human being 
now to address his rebuttal okay let us say that contraceptives failed thus the woman woke up pregnant 
defense case de morality my opponent dismisses this argument stating that it is irrelevant and that i have the bop 
it was the woman s intention to use birth control and wished not have a life attached her but it failed 
 fetus argument since the vast majority aborts during the embryonic period I am not sure why we need to debate the fetus biological form since it has no relevance to the illegalization of this practice but I will proceed anyway 
fetus not really innocent addressing the theory presented j t stated that even if the embryo fetus has a right to life it does not have a right to use the pregnant womans body so technically the fetus is not at all innocent as it invades the woman s privacy and violates women s rights 
 million per year this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion this process is more dangerous expensive and of course unlawful  
that means that the fetus is not fully developed yet  which means that the pregnancy is still in its embryonic period  
there are many scenarios where the mother s life is at risk unless she aborts if we deprive them of aborting we are not only killing the mother but also giving society a bad name 
out of those  million how can you say for sure that they did not migrate to other countries or if they even have a decent job or if they died or have an illness 
a fetus being human is highly a controversial issue and it will probably never end 
my opponent seems to be confusing us with calculations and claims that the usfg could have saved  trillion usd if roe was not decided because  million un aborted people could have lived by now and each would have earned an average of  
furthermore pro must prove that an embryo is still as equal as a fetus or a human being he also needs to show sufficient proof that it is enough to ban them 
she says that the right to life does not entail the right to use another persons body and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something the use of your body to which he has no right 
women who are raped should not suffer  months of carrying a child she did not want especially if she is poor 
since I have shown that illegalizing abortion violates rights and that it poses a danger to women this practice should remain legal 
would you want the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector state 
utilitarianism a simple definition of utilitarianism is that it determines the moral worth of an action only by its resulting outcome and that one can only weigh the morality of an action after knowing all its consequences  
this is false since he did not give a source I would like to point out that  in  abortions in the us occur in the first  weeks of pregnancy   
thanks for instigating good luck and happy holidays 
instead of trying to reign em all in and respond to em especially the ones that invovolve semantics I will just leave it to the voters 
he is not able to debate on the actual issues at hand so chooses to go off on a tangent 
what does the specific location inside of or outside of the womb matter 
what signnificance is a few inches 
there was merely a technical malfunction 
i believe they are trying to say that the constitution only consists of guidlines though this may be true we can not completely disregard the amendments particularly those that give rights to the individuals and to the states 
it is the duty of the american government to follow the established by the constitution and allow that states to decide whether or not abortion is legal 
and as a point of clarification i did not say that my opponent had integrated bias people but that they were bias themselves 
public education has taught me that only scores matter 
my opponent states that we must consider adoption before abortion however they seem to have ignored the constitution and the fact that adoption is still an available and encouraged process 
my opponent also decided to throw in a nice little snippet rather unrelated to the debate at hand saying 
not only does this amendment give the states the power to allow abortion if they decide that a fetus is not alive by law it gives further power to the people 
and the majority of women having abortions are single meaning those fetuses would not have fathers 
the united states government as a whole has no power over matters of the state 
for example abortion is legal in california because the states judicial system ruled that a fetus was not alive until a certain stage of pregnancy 
however many pro life activists call abortion which is indeed quite illegal as it infringes upon another citizens rights like living 
as a point of clarification my opponent seems to be the pro in relation to the topic therefore i am the con 
my opponent says that the entire country should not value it 
because my opponent has not refuted the claims i made in my initial argument regarding abortion in cases of rape or medical necessity i have satisfied my burden 
in not responding to those claims let alone refuting them my opponent has implicitly agreed thus violating the terms of his own burden 
it is very difficult to continue this debate as my opponent has not responded to any of my arguments 
i would like to reiterate that the burden of proof still stands i must prove that abortion is just in just one case whereas my opponent must prove that it is unjust in every case 
throughout the use of analogies initially presented by judith jarvis thompson professor of philosophy at mit i showed that in the case of rape or medical need abortion is not unjust 
i will continue to focus on abortion in the case of rape or medical need as it is often the most cut and dry of the various reasons for seeking a termination of pregnancy 
say the violinist is famous but the fact of the matter is that you are keeping this person alive if he is unplugged he will die 
having the right to life does not necessarily mean that you have the right to use someone elses body to promote and protect said right to life 
i fully understand that abortions due to rape account for a very small percentage of abortions but should not these women have access to a safe procedure that allows them to protect their rights 
ultimately the right to life of a fetus does not trump the right to life right to ones body of a mother especially in the case of rape or pregnancy wherein the mothers life is in danger 
the important thing to remember is that you were kidnapped and erroneously chosen for this task of keeping the violinist alive you woke up attached to him after all this is meant to be analogous to rape as thompson specifically supports abortion in that instance 
it is not about arguing with science because in order to claim that abortion is wrong because a fetus is a living thing you would have to give life some value pushing this debate into the realm of ethics 
 you may find it trivial that i used thompsons analogy of a violinist being plugged into ones body to sum up the issues surrounding the right to life in the abortion debate but it is perhaps the easiest way to understand the right to choice side 
of course life would have to have value in order to be perceived as more important than the right to ones body 
this of course brings to mind the question of the value of a mothers life 
this is where the debate tends to get muddy as defining is much more complex than simply defining the activities of cells 
thompsons point here is that the right to life argument is not without it is issues i e it is not a black and white ordeal 
advocating that the government remove legal restrictions on a medical procedure is the very thing that prevents the unfortunate back alley and home abortions 
younger women are encourage to seek counself from their parents but should not be quired to inform them or thave them to consent to a procedure 
i do not need to win all six points in my constructive to win this speech this is completely abusive and was not agreed upon before the debate 
my opponent fails to answer my argument that spouses can be abusive or hard to contact and can have undue influence over their womans right to an abortion 
this procedure is called intact dilation and extraction is rarely necessary to preserve the life of a woman in later term 
women who resort to these unfortunate choices often due so because of legal restrictions placed upon them 
the womans level of mental development is irrelevant in determining her right to an abortion 
additionally many women in the you s are separated but not legally divorced yet from their husbands 
for example if a rare genetic disorder was discovered that would create a baby born with a severe physical or mental impairment that was not correctable and would lead to a short depressing lifespan or if a woman life would be seriously endangered by continuing with the pregnancy 
in some you s states informed consent laws sometimes called laws require that a woman seeking an elective abortion be given factual information by the abortion provider about her legal rights alternatives to abortion such as adoption available public and private assistance and medical facts 
waiting periods generally serve no purpose the fetus continues to develop the longer that a woman waits for an abortion 
late term abortions would only be performed in extenuating circumstances such as when the physical health of the woman is placed in severe jeopardy 
other developed countries including canada have no legal restrictions on abortion and have far lower abortion rates than countries that place legal restrictions on the procedure namely the you s and countries in south america 
if parents are allowed to influence their daughters decisions the daughter may resort to dangerous risky means in order to obtain an abortion 
the first round is for acceptance 
abortion doctors similarly might be challenged by the process of an abortion and even believe that they are the fetus but nevertheless acknowledge the need for abortions and so are comfortable with their profession 
while a law that mitigates the damages done by this would be ideal such a law could not be implemented without having detrimental effects towards women in different situations where the fathers may use such tools to because harm case in point rapists wanting parental rights over children born out of sexual assault 
there is a small paradox at the center of the argument that cannot be legislated or debated in court if you are in a relationship with something that discounts your concerns regarding your unborn child that may not be a legal issue but a personal decision that cannot be undone 
or they would decide that they are not ready for a child and agree to terminate the pregnancy despite the difficulty and guilt surrounding the implications of their decision 
the flip side is the emotional part of a man learning that his childs life has been terminated without his knowledge consent or having his concerns addressed 
to claim that the legalities of a hypothetical situation must fit your opinion removes the idea that the problem in society needs to be identified 
 in excess of three million is a figure I have heard before but i will have to nail down a supported figure 
the idea that a man can have a legal say over a womans body is the core of the argument 
you have yet to prove that a loving father in a committed relationship with a stable person has suffered the loss of a child due to an abortion he was not consulted about 
this is religious faith based claim that has no grounding in any study performed to date nor can it be demonstrated by anecdotal evidence 
it is used to reduce the physical contrast of the two in order to minimize pregnancy 
however the odds are still in favour of it being correct in general so i will provide an example of a situation in which abortion would be best for both mother and child in my arguments section 
 sorry for the late response i just got a spike of homework so i did not have much time to do debating as con has taken the pro life side i will assume that i no longer need to argue that there are cases in which abortion is not ethical as we are in agreement on that so i will not rebut any of your rebuttals to my statements saying that abortion can be unethical 
to avoid any guessing over the time i will assume that the baby is conscious at a little past  weeks since the parts of the brain for thought and emotion are more complex than the parts for motor control 
in a case where an embryo or fetus has a lethal birth defect it only makes sense to abort it rather than forcing it to be carried for  months with this and then be born only to have their brain painfully destroyed 
therefore even though we can not read minds and so do not know the exact time that a baby is conscious we do know that a baby definitely has no consciousness until it has a brain that is at least partially developed 
however i am arguing that there are cases in which abortion should be allowed and cases in which it should not so the fact that i did not disprove some of your points does not cost me the debate 
to do so to an unborn child for the same reason these entire premise of these two paragraphs is that a zygote is already a human as i have proven above is potentially false and i will prove later that it is actually false 
 if con has a problem with any rule it will be resolved in the comments section so that we do not wast the debate arguing about rules any accusations of a logical fallacy must be supported follow basic rules of debating politeness happy debating 
i am arguing that there are certain times when abortion is wrong and should not be done and there are times that it is acceptable 
 burden of proof is shared first round is acceptance clarification of position and whatever else con feels necessary but no arguments to make sure that we both have  argument rounds 
thank you for posting i look forward to it 
my argument is this  the moral position of one does not necessarily negate the moral position of another in a just society 
pro states my argument is this  the government should not try to impose morality onto people but should instead let them  banning abortion imposes morality onto women 
it does not ask should a just society bend to the morals of one group over another s 
it may not be a complete rewrite but enough to allow slack to pro when rebutting my points 
 a just society balances rightness in some part on utility and greatest happiness obtainable 
when you talk about the possibility of an adoptive parent and that chance being taken away i turn you towards the fact that there are many more possible children to adopt than there are people adopting for if the numbers were the same if not more parents than kids then there would be no more children who are looking for adoptive parents 
an abortion can not be painful to a child as at the stage of development they can legally be aborted at they are a very simple organism that cannot feel pain or trauma it is incapable of knowledge around subjects such as this for instance can you find anyone that can tell you what their life was like before they were born then i would except the possibility of gathering knowledge but no one has ever made this feat 
in the united kingdom which is where i live there is no abortion after  weeks which is still before any cognitive function 
however a life is something that can function as a sentient being at this age a foetus is not sentient it is only working off of impulses that because reactions it is not in control of itself or its actions this is like when an animal is killed using an electric bolt the way they are killed now there are still electrical impulses that because actions because of the nerves that still cat after death 
that is over three quarters of the uk population including both men and women 
if you do think that a fetus has the right to life i would also like to point out that regulating abortions does not mean you decrease the number of abortions that take place 
this is a proven impact of making abortions illegal on president bushs first day in office he reinstated the global gag rule which suppressed all aid foreign aid that went to ngos that engaged in abortion activity 
i will focus my position on some of the major points first is the question of whether or not aborted fetuses are at a point of development when it can be considered a life 
while making them illegal could deter some women from seeking abortions it does not address the fundamental causes of abortion social pressures the reason that there is a demand for abortions now 
this does not in itself demonstrate that such abortions are morally permissible but it does show that the rights based argument against abortion fails to show that they are impermissible 
not only does it ignore my main argument he actually copy pastes the vast majority of his argument from the following website it was quite easy to suspect and find that he copypasted his argument 
as i argued in my previous argument if a fetus does not have the mental requirements to be a person defined philosophically as a rational sapient entity then it is not murder and therefore not immoral to kill a fetus 
whatever it was it lead to a lackluster argument being used in his last round how depressing 
i was expecting for him to develop on the importance of instrospection and such but it seems his response was anticlimatic of sorts 
however i just want to point out the intellectual dishonesty of my what my opponent has done 
my opponents argument he relies simply on the fact that since a law exists in favor for anti abortion a way that it can be interpreted at least then this serves as an argument 
i argue that unless the fetus is a person which is an entity that is rational and possess the adequate mental faculties to introspect then abortion is okay 
however do realize that part of the punishment may be that the parents did not originally want the fetus to die abortion against their consent so i suppose some part of the law may account for that though it will be tricky 
finally while i agree that i have a burden it should not be a controversy that my opponent also has a burden to prove a situation in which the act of abortion is wrong 
if he does succesfully then he does indeed show abortion to be murder and thus to be wrong 
 the right of a fetus killing a pregnant woman quote if you kill a pregnant woman you are charged with two murders 
well even if that is so this is no argument 
however i will attack his premise that a late term fetus for the sake of clarity will just be known as a fetus is a human being 
it had a beating heart functioning brain skeletal respiratory digestive and other bodily systems 
i thank my opponent for creating this debate and contrary to the woes of those in the comment sections I am sure i will not fall for whatever sly trick my opponent may have used d quote as my opponent is affirmative the burden of proof lies on him her 
simple as that it is brain is not fully developed to meet such a criteria 
 fetuses do not have rights because a fetus is not self aware it does not have rights 
if you are really in favor of a law against abortion consider the effect that this would have on society it would change our entire societys view towards sex see point  paragraphs above it would result in a large increase in pregnancies in which case we have to think about how large families would get how that would affect jobs economy etc 
we are all people made up of good and bad and no other human who is no better than us in any manner has the right to decide when we die 
if there is a law against abortion do you realize how many pregnant mothers you will have who are  opposed to their pregnancy 
 we already do not have enough homes for all the children up for adoption 
you say that women should take responsibility for their actions 
some of these points may seem extreme but the fact is that there is so much more to think about when considering a law like this beyond the fact that a fetus will be allowed to be born 
 there would be many men paying in child support potentially to more than one woman women who really did not want the child would still seek out an abortion that might be unsafe for her health 
the shame that many of these women feel would need to change or are you really going to insist that every woman keep her child and then still look with scorn upon the young teenage mother 
criminal history can depend on how a person was raised the setting they were raised in their mental stability drug use etc 
this is something that men will never have to actually experience so it is easy for you to speak about because it is a decision you will never have to face 
does this mean that all these things most of which are factors that someone cannot control should allow a person to be punished by death 
yes it is ultimately the womans choice to abort but the fact is that the man is therefore exempt from all responsibility of having put this difficult choice on the woman when it is  his fault she is in the position of having to make that decision in the first place 
clearly women who do not desire to get pregnant are doing what is necessary to not have to make the decision to have an abortion 
 what if your daughter became pregnant because she was taken advantage of at age  by an older boy 
yes it seems we do agree on the principle that abortion itself is a sad negative thing 
for me i feel that if i agreed to let these convicted murders be put to death that would be condoning the exact thing that i find wrong about them 
i was not going to accept your challenge at first because in theory i do not actually with your stance in the title of this debate 
when i chose as my stance on abortion i meant this in reference to the idea of whether abortion should be legal or not 
as you mentioned yours take on life is that it is from conception when a sperm fertilizes egg 
beyond the fact that i do not agree with the fundamental idea of it it is not going to be  accurate 
however your question is a good one and I would like to at least explain my thought process for the answers to the questions in my profile which is i assume where you found that i with abortion yet with the death penalty for me factors for which i base my decisions surrounding my choice not to support the death penalty are very different from those on which i base my decision to be pro choice 
do i with the idea of abortion in general 
having the power to kill people for doing the same thing to someone else strikes me as an odd way of teaching a lesson 
this for me presents a quandary that i do not feel i need to address to decide my stance on abortion 
taking away their right to breathe and live is a whole other step up from taking away their right to be free in society by keeping them in a prison cell for the rest of their life and i do not think that the satisfaction that the families of those murdered feel is enough 
when it comes to the death penalty first and foremost it quite simply does not sit well with me 
now obviously just because i do not want to kill these people does not mean i want them to be free 
probably the biggest reason i am against the death sentence is that i think it is unnecessary 
so if we can show that the conditions are appropriate even beyond self defense an abortion can be justified even if it is 
opponents of abortion often argue that a fetus has an inviolable right to life 
and importantly it also demonstrates that there is no such thing as an 
this is misleading in partial birth abortion as the term suggests the foetus is not fully born when it is killed the purpose of collapsing the skull is to allow the foetus head to pass more easily through the birth canal 
that is your belief that is not strongly supported by science 
i do not believe it is to abort in the earliest terms of pregnancy at all 
that being said religious text does not apply when it comes to the legal argument that an embryo or fetus has rights 
a baby being genetically the same at conception or at any stage before birth as it is after birth does not mean it has the capability to make choices or use rights at all stages 
the fetus has no cognitive ability to make sound decisions 
the womans choice to not bring a fetus to term is akin to an adult making a judgement call regarding their offspring 
examples of extreme late term abortion and mothers who suffer permanent medical complications are not the norm 
people are aware that a form of life is being terminated and are not offended enough before the  week to outlaw it 
i respect that you do not like the idea of abortion especially in the   weeks I am guessing but many women are just as offended by the idea that it is not their choice 
to assume that every couple or single woman are incapable of error or other issues avoided with easy access to birth control is to live in a fantasy world where all these unwanted children are adopted and loved 
but i must point out that as repulsive as i find it i believe the war and mass euthanasia of animals regularly practiced by this country is necessary 
as far as most abortions being harmful to the mother this statement is simply untrue 
if a woman does not want a baby there are many contraceptive methods out there 
i would assume this is because our society tends to agree with capital punishment euthanasia for terminally I will and war 
you are again making a point based on personal belief that is not collectively held by all people hence why the courts have ruled the way they have 
there are not enough people to take care of the children in need as it is i can not imagine adding more 
i have either won this debate already or lost it already because i have no clue how to comprehend what the instigator just said 
the resolution is negated and i affirm that a mother should always have the right to an abortion 
 argument from defenseshe fails to address the issue at hand a baby is taking nutrients from the mother removal of nutrients and be conceived as harm since this is considered harm the mother has the right to abort the baby under us laws 
i have shown this in a majority of waysmy adversary is claiming that by having an abortion in every possible situation you are essentially committing murder but she has failed to distinguish that a fetus is a human life and not just life or the potential of human life 
if you are killing the potential of life or something that is not a human life you are not committing murder therefore she fails to address this point 
my adversary would have needed to show that the baby is in fact a human and not a life 
to defeat this syllogism and initial point she would have to show that taking nutrients is not considered harm 
she actually agrees in a sense that the fetus is causing harm which clarifies my stance by saying the mother agrees to the harm 
justifiable homicide killing without criminal intent just as in self defense we are promised the right to defend ourselves from any top of bodily harm and a fetus is imposing bodily harm on a mother so she has the right to defend herself from the harm presented 
the romans used gladiators to fight to the death in the coliseum and even in modern time there are still tribes that kill for pleasure and fun 
justifiable homicidal is recognized by the law and is allowed mainly under the promise of self defense as promised to us by the second amendment  murder moralityeven if she gets around the other two contentions she must then show that murdering in general is wrong 
there are a great number of traits a fetus must exhibit to be considered a person and not just a  argument from self defensethe fetus by all means is a parasite to the motherparasite an organism that lives on or in an organism of another species known as the host from the body of which it obtains nutriment 
a what qualifies something as a person and not a lifecommon characteristics most people share are conscious the ability to feel pain thought and response 
resolved a pregnant woman should not always the right to  is the fetus a life or personwe first have to arrive at the fact a fetus is a person and not a life 
the main argument in the case of abortion is that it could be considered murder meaning that would be the death of another person 
poor woman are most susceptible to circumstances in which abortion is necessary 
if we made laws based on potential low income uneducated minority folks would be thrown in jail by default because they are the demographic most likely to commit crimes 
the potential argument swings both ways the fetus you aborted could be a serial rapist or create a master genocide plan 
so and so ended up to be a wonderful person and their mother doubted whether to have kids 
if you claim it does why have not you been forced to donate one of your kidneys a few lung lobes bone marrow blood liver pieces etc 
if abortion is illegal dead people will officially have more rights than pregnant people because a dead person s organs can not be used if they are not a consenting organ donor 
here are the main things bodily autonomy is the most important argument because it is bulletproof really 
abortions are going to happen no matter what so if you really care about pregnant people you had better simmer down and let abortion be 
you may support for unborn children but the truth is they are already equal no born person has the right to infringe on someone elses bodily autonomy 
some animals eat poisonous plants and some even walk through spaces too small for them to crush the fetus 
 even if you will not let the idea go that abortion is murder it is justifiable homicide self defense 
these are known as miscarriages and two thirds of human conception is naturally aborted by that process so no sometimes the woman does not have the choice to terminate the fetus and the body does it for them 
also you have left one of my arguments uncontested if fetal rights were enshrined in law womens bodies rights and health would be subordinated to the protection of embryos 
therefore the argument that you are taking life away from a fetus is completely null unless you can provide facts to prove otherwise 
that is not necessarily true sometimes nature aborts the pregnancy before it reaches fetal viability 
if you are a young woman which in itself can because many dangerous sometimes life threatening situations 
they make the woman feel guilty for wanting to abort the child and or having such sexual activities ultimately dismissing compassion where it is needed 
when in actuality abortions can have a beneficial effect on the mother in numerous different scenarios lowering the risk of death to the mother during labor lowering the risk of having to use scarce finances to care for a child and it especially helps when the woman has been raped or was involved in unwanted incest 
there is not a consensus to when a human life begins that argument is flimsy due to the fact that sperm and egg are living and it could be argued that they too have human life 
yet most of the sperm is wasted and almost two thirds of human conception is spontaneously aborted by nature itself 
i can only assume that is derogatory meaning that it is badly affecting the mother and the child 
i will debate that abortion is not a violation of human rights 
it does not matter if you are having a hard time following my arguement which i doubt because i did not put the period at the end of a sentence its the voters choice 
unless of course you state otherwise in your  rulesi have no broken any of your  rules so you cannot say that I have somehow broken them 
some might but your generalizing an entire population of women whose problems you do not knowthroughout this debate you have provided no sources to effictivley claim that having an abortion in the  or  trimester is selfish 
if the voters voted on sources they would either vote for me or tie because you have given nothing to back up your claims except for  guess what that source was 
whether it is anecdotal or not its a source 
 and  you still call them selfish because many of them are in the second and third trimester according to your own arguement 
once the fetus starts to develop then the signature bulge will start to show but by that time they could be in the second trimester  again women do not always find out they are pregnant immediatley at the first trimester 
before i rebutt my opponents claims i would like to address something he saidfirst of all you should add periods at the end of your sentences 
 firstly to assert that abortions should only be performed for maternal safety so as to leave a viable vessel for possible future progeny is to admit that women are nothing more than chattel to be viewed inexorably as life support systems for fetuses and potential runny noses and skinned knees 
in roe v wade the constitutional right to privacy was weighed with the states interest in the fetus and it was found that severely limiting a womens agency over her reproductive biology did not pass constitutional muster 
finally please note that i am from south africa where abortion is one hundred percent legal 
by this argument women must either practice celibacy the only  guaranteed form of contraception well almost if you count the immaculate conception or else risk being the hostages of their reproductive biology up until to the age of final fertility 
this belief is based on the idea that there is a set of natural processes which eventually leads to a human being outside of the womb let us for the sake of argument tentatively agree that life at least in potential occurs at conception 
i am afraid that unless pro can produce evidence that abortion is directly linked to this premise would be shaky at best 
in the interest of time and attention i will for the first round attempt to confine my points specifically to those raised by the instigator 
i feel that there are arguments especially relating to autonomy and agency which can be related to scenarios outside of the womb but i dismiss the imagined outcome of denigrating human life as being automatic or guaranteed 
i assume that pro wishes to converge on the question because pro anticipates this would demonstrate that if life is said to exist then objectively it cannot be taken away 
would this then extend to and cover all forms of human intervention that assists or ends life e g should we take polio vaccines 
if not they will help inform the debate going forward a brief riposte by pro in part or whole would be appreciated if birth control was practiced but failed if the pregnancy is a product of rape if the pregnancy is a product of an incestuous relationship if the pregnancy is part of an arranged or child marriage if a significant risk exists of passing on a genetically transferable disease if pregnancy is a result of mis or under education if the women was not in a culpable state of mind at the time of conception this includes acute and chronic psychological states of mind affected by neurophysiology or external factors 
once again after the  week mark the child can usually be removed from the mothers womb and continue living on assisted support 
however the biggest problem with this ridiculous comparison is it in no way address early pregnancy terminations vs 
terminating a pregnancy a week before a womans due date is not some absurd hypothetical 
case and point pro begins by asking about the rights of the infant but then never addresses those rights 
it is clear that pro does not understand they have the burden of proof for this debate 
as i already addressed this in the previous round i will simply quote the late christopher hitchens anything that can be asserted without evidence 
if pro believes the infant has some rights that are being trespassed upon then pro needs to address exactly what those rights are and how they are being trespassed upon 
my opponent makes the claim that sometimes an infants rights should be prioritized 
and at that time the care and well being of the child is transferred to the state 
another person does not have any rights over the use of her body at any time 
infants should not be afforded special rights over another person simply because they are infants 
but it does not have the right to life by violating another persons rights 
abortions also occur when the mothers life is in danger 
so it is plainly obvious that in addition to physical differences between the two there is a distinct philosophical difference between the two based on the intent and reasoning used to perform the acts which conversely creates a divergence in the morality of the two 
abortions are done because the mother does not want the fetus inside of her living in her 
death from gunfire can be the result of bleeding out from a wound the loss of critical organs such as the brain heart or lungs seizure from shock ect 
the method by which gun crimes and abortion occur are entirely different 
i invite pro to let me know when they would like to retry this debate 
when you feel better we can repost our opening rounds and continue the debate 
conclusioni have clearly shown that the unborn are  individual members of the human race and the living children of both parents  that the foundation of our justice system is that everyone is created equal and thus equal before the law  that the justification for abortion is just another form of  parents have a duty to provide for minor children until they are able to provide for themselvesas noted in my introduction the next couple of rounds will be used to pit the best arguments against my position in order to show that the father should have no say over whether the mother should or should not have an abortion i invite pro to continue the presentation of their argument 
however i will show over the next couple of rounds that this is only an apparent disconnect because the greater truth of the nature of the unborn child is being ignored 
by using the term father and not some qualifying term like future father in the debate topic pro has conceded that the unborn is already the child of both parents 
mammals have the added ability to protect and nurture their young within the mother until a much later stage of development 
pros use of the word in the debate title would indicate that this is the governing factor in the debate 
i will follow this round up with the best pro arguments i can think of or find anywhere else on the internet and show them to be inadequate to prove the pro side of the debate 
pro choice not a personif the unborn tissue is not a person then it should have no legal standing and it is classified as merely a part of the mothers body or her property to do with as she pleases and the father should have no say 
it is a resolution that both the pro life side and pro choice sides can agree upon as this is fundamentally a debate about personhood 
an issue that both those who are pro life and pro choice will refute as neither side would agree that the father should ultimately have any say in the decision to abort for completely opposite reasons 
this is a prejudice based solely on a single characteristic of the other person that attempts to dehumanize them in one fashion or another 
additionally the law would not permit me to intentionally kill my child after birth first degree murder murder occurs where the person who causes the death of a human being means to because his death or means to because him bodily harm that he knows is likely to because his death and is reckless whether death ensues or not 
this fundamental right is not to be confused with privileges granted by the state such as the right to drive vote etc 
humanity has a history of the powerful denying the rights of the weak based on personal prejudice or selfish motive 
introductioni thank pro for the opportunity to debate this topic 
i thank philocat for accepting my challenge to this topic 
we can penalise them if you say no you can penalise the girls who belong to your society then force women who belong to your society to help the baby in order to survive not others 
 rules which does not exist but thought to exist first there is no standart form of a rules named unalienable rights and we have not established a rule like that 
and everybody is not to live according to it part is also answer to i will be arguing that the woman should not have the choice to abort a child due our unalienable right to life and the very basics of our human dignity 
 the reason unalienable rights exist that rules does not exist just presumed to be existing in fact no rule like that and there are so many types of unalienable rules in the usa too according to which we have to live 
that example refutes and can refute any kind of arguement against liberty on abortion that is just enough to understand and explain that abortion is the right of a human but yet i will answer him when i worte in short words i thought that he will understand seems he did not 
when the standart form of rules like that gets created come and use it as an arguement at this point there is no rules or rights like that or there iis a rule like that and do not i know it 
 has never existed and always believed to exist and you can not require and force somebody to your beliefs and you rpresumptious rules if you can i also can this will result with the civil war in the usa and the world do you agree with me 
 in response to me arguing that innocent human life is not to be terminated do to respect for human dignity and the right to life i hav enever said that the baby needs to be killed 
 as americans we have established that the right to life is an unalienable right and is to never be taken away unless the rights of the individual is taken away due to actions they have committed against the society 
 you have a right to leave baby has a right to live on but the woman has also right not to destroy her life so that the baby can live on i do not understand what my opponent is saying due to atrocious grammatical mistakes 
 every abortion takes the life of an unborn member of the human race let us consider him the human no matter born or not you are destroying the right of the woman not to help 
according to our rules rules which does not exist but thought to exist like that every action i counted is crime then we have a right to penalise anybody who drinks alcohol has sex before marriage and e t c because our unalienable rules let us penalise such person 
 even if we say that rules exist however the usa is multinational country and there are so many types of nationalities in the usa each nationality may have its own unalienable rules then it is not justice to force somebody according to your unalienable rules 
you answer   dollars for this month i gave you this moneym and then you had a chance to survive and now you are alive but second month comes and you still need money you come to me and ask artur you are a rich man without your help i have no chance to survive please give me   which supplies all the money i need for the treatment of this month if you do not provide me with the money i need then i can not survive 
 you have a right to leave baby has a right to live on but the woman has also right not to destroy her life so that the baby can live on as i stated on the first round 
she does not say that kill my baby if you can make the baby living in a diffrent way but she can not be required to provide for others life how come can you think that she has to destroy her own life for that baby 
i provide you with money so that you can survive and woman provides baby with the things that the baby needs in order to survive can you have a right to force me to give you money 
and abortion does not mean if you want and can let the baby live the woman will not say my baby has to die she just does not want to carry her 
 as americans we have established that the right to life is an unalienable right and is to never be taken away unless the rights of the individual is taken away due to actions they have committed against the society 
 you may have a moral rules laws and maybe abortion is out of moral but you can not require or force somebody to live according to the rules set by society if it contradicts the liberty of person you have no choice 
i think abortion must be free it must be up to the pregnant woman 
you may bring an arguement which says abortion must be banned because it is injustice and e t c and i will give answer if it is wrong 
it is the meaning of abortion 
pro gives no response to my arguments 
my opponent makes no posts this round 
you find out the worst your birth control failed and now you are in the very very early stages of pregnancy 
imagine the pain and suffering you would be forced through not to mention the danger births resulting in the death of the mother are still not uncommon against your will 
if pro had his way this complete stranger would suddenly be able to destroy your right to an abortion simply because it was his sperm that got lucky enough to reach an egg 
forcing a woman to have a baby that she does not want is damaging to all parties involved whether the state the mother the father or another relative is taking care of it 
a forced baby is something the mother does not want so can there be any emotional ownership towards the child from the mother 
 to be the that expresses ownership and again what about in cases in which the mothers life is at risk 
what do you suggest should be done in the cases that occur where in the mothers life is at risk 
the assertion that obtaining an abortion is always the result of irresponsible behaviour is disrespectful to every woman undergoing an abortion 
the woman actually does have every right to abort a child that she did not consent to 
 of all you can not say that you won the  round because that is the peoples decision not yours 
you said that i failed to counter any of your arguments but its kind of the other way around you have not answered all of my questions yet i have answered all of yours 
also the child would be upset that he or she is a raped baby child because they know that its wrong 
i do not think she is been raped four times 
this will make the child so upset and the child will have to live for the rest of his or her life knowing that he or her is a raped child 
you said that its not the babies fault and the baby would not want to die but there also have been a very large number of cases of babies who have grown up found there real mothers asked them why they have been adopted and then the mother tells them the story 
how would you feel if say for example your wife got raped got pregnant and could not have an abortion when she wanted to 
so a woman should have the decision right to have an abortion if she gets raped 
and if she gets pregnant and gives birth and its to late to have an abortion because she had no choice but to keep it then she will have to live with something she never wanted 
i believe that if a woman gets raped she should have the decision right to have an abortion 
is terminating a fetus which can neither feel emotions nor be conscious of its own really be considered equivalent to killing a 
other sets of criteria conclude that an embryo lacks personhood and a right to life because it lacks self consciousness rationality and autonomy 
an embryo is not a person because it satisfies only one criterion namely consciousness and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain 
i put a lot of effort into my argument wasted effort 
from what i gather of his comments in the comments section I am supposed to just say what i believe and he will observe it 
 one can extend some of what i said above to fully grown adults who are too retarded to rake care of themselves 
if it were born it would be a burden on the mother itself and society 
say the baby was prenatally diagnosed with a rare disease which made it paralyzed from the neck down be in constant pain and mentally retarded 
what i had stated in my opinion on abortion is not a guideline just an assertion that there are cases where it is better for one decision to be made for another person rather than having them make it themselves 
what if the baby has a debilitating disease that renders him unable to feel happiness but the mother out of her selfish desire to raise an offspring decides to keep it 
she would gain her utility society would see her suffering and learn that giving birth to a sad baby is bad 
yes i believe that if a person does not have to capacity to ask for their own rights then they have no rights 
when he is hooked up a hypothetical machine that constantly injects dopamine serotonin adrenalin or any other chemicals into his brain without building any resistance he is happy and that is what he is looking for regardless of what noble causes he believe he is looking for 
if she wants to kill the baby when it is not born what makes her suddenly want to keep it alive after it is born 
the most practical thing would be to leave it up to mother 
babies who can not even put  and  together do not deserve rights 
i believe i am the best at benefiting myself in some cases but i other cases I would rather lay taxes 
the problem with society is that it looks at abortion as inherently bad 
the mother loses utility if she is forced to give birth and the baby does not have the capacity to have utility 
before  weeks a foetus does not feel pain is not conscious of itself or its surroundings 
is terminating a foetus which can neither feel nor think and is not conscious of its own existence really commensurable with the killing of a person 
until a fetus can survive on its own it cannot be called a life any more than the acorn can be called a tree 
my opponent has failed to respond to my statistic that ninety five percent of women who have had abortions do not regret the decision to terminate their pregnanciesconclusion to conclude this debate i believe that i have won for the following reasons 
arguments con essentially concedes and even if you do not view that as a concession then if you look back at my opponents argument for round  you will realise that that was not much better than forfeiting 
conduct it is also interesting to note that my opponent copy and pasted a lot of his arguments from this website and did not quote them is an example 
you can not argue against the death penalty and then say that it is only okay for the worst criminals to have the death penalty a debate does not work this way 
spelling and grammar tiedsources as well as cons sources being bias they have also copy and pasted a lot of their argument as stated above in greater detail 
you have dismissed my argument regarding rape with only a few comments which i will respond to later 
minorities still matter they should not be disregarded and ignored because of this 
just because teenagers who get pregnant are a minority it does not mean that they should be ignored 
or the reason that their mother cannot live the life she wants to live 
do you think that it is okay to ban abortions just because most people who have an abortion are not raped 
i accept this debate 
so you did not provide any new arguments so i have to ask if abortion is murder and an embryo qualifies as a human that would make taking a morning after pill murder then right 
the thing with abortion after the nervous system is pretty much fully finished developing is that at that point it really is a human being as in they can feel they have a working brain they can move 
i believe that females have a right as a human being to not go through the birth process and abort the fetus because there is not enough reason to take this right from them in a secular nation where you have a right to do anything that does not take away the rights of anyone else 
abortion does not actively take away the rights of any people 
then there will be  rounds to argue or give rebuttals as you see fit 
i know that if those mothers can give their babies in adoption instead of killing them because they will find someone that adopts them and loves them 
as abortion is illegal in some places we have to take into account that 
however we are not discussing the moral implications of abortion just the selfish aspect 
sources for the whole debate common sense induced abortion in the united states  guttmacher institute re thinking abortion psychology gender and the law  mary boyle three essays on the theory of sexuality  sigmund freud the ego and the id  sigmund freud good luck for my opponent 
however we are not discussing the moral implications of abortion just the selfish aspect 
but you did not so i have to assume you are talking about all the category of middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester 
con is saying that it is nonsense to bring a child into the world if they are unloved 
so on balance middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester are not selfish 
anyway i conceded that the mothers line of reasoning was flawed but to show that is not what we are talking about 
i know that if those mothers can give their babies in adoption instead of killing them because they will find someone that adopts them and loves them 
i would like to point out this part of cons statement specifically one of the worst thing that could happen to someone is having parents who do not love him 
as well as this i always wrote in a polite fashion while pro was insulting and rude breaking the rules of the site 
so basically the resolution is that you conclude middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish 
this is the definition of selfish that is used in this debate s own personal profit or pleasure 
this is a flagrant violation of the rules and should be taken into account by the judges 
if a mother is conscious that she will not love that baby that will born nearly it is nonsense to bring him to the world 
if a mother is conscious that she will not love that baby that will born nearly it is nonsense to bring him to the world 
if a mother is conscious that she will not love that baby that will born nearly it is nonsense to bring him to the world 
only in the green countries mothers can have abortion in the others abortion only happens if it is the only way to save a mothers life 
i can deny that for sure some women get abortions because they are selfish but this does not mean that all of them are selfish 
if you want to debate the morality of middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester put up another debate 
three fourths say they cannot afford a child half say they are having problems with their husband or partner as you can see all the reasons are not selfish 
then nearly a bit less than half of the globe rather than in most countries 
 lastly i want to emphasise the generalising nature of the resolution 
they make a rather silly reasoning but they think in others thus they are not being selfish 
pro is stating that all middle class and rich women who get abortions past their first trimester are selfish 
in this debate we are arguing about the selfishness related to this decision 
and even after that point a woman should be allowed to decide for herself what she wants to do with her body that is not something anyone can make for her 
women should be allowed to receive an abortion before that time since there is not any fully formed human that can live on it is own 
a lot of the disagreements that occur between both sides in this matter stem from one question when should the fetus be considered a child 
no one can tell a women if she wants to have a baby or not and therefore should chose what she wants to do 
definitions explanations restricted abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy 
round  is for acceptance only no arguments to be presented in round  
the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age 
the reason most of do not compare the killings of the usa army to nazi germany is that we realize there are morally relevant factors that apply or do not apply to different situations and thus one situation even though they may have some things in common even killing does not necessarily mean they are morally equivalent 
none of pros arguments can change the one simple truth of it all killing is wrong once again the double standard is shown 
more than  of all abortions are simply done by women who do not want to live with the consequences of their actions 
i take it con drops this moral equivalency argument in light of my counters 
the point is not even the pro life anti choicer believes in such a simplistic absolute right to life and if such a person was to selectively apply such an absolute right to life to justify denying an abortion would be a double standard hypocritical 
i maintain that the absolute right to life right not to be killed premise is untenable and cons argument against abortion rests upon this flawed selectively applied premise and thus should be rejected 
when it comes to killing in other areas well there are morally relevant factors at play and in case xyz killing is not or may not be wrong 
what i rebuked con for is using forced continuation of pregnancy as some sort of punishment and the implication if such a woman gets an abortion they are getting away with something 
the right to life right not to be killed is often invoked as justification for not allowing abortion 
so here is the logical point if rights and freedoms are such that we can not force the billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few millions to save thinking feeling self aware humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily rights and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos 
the reason most of do not compare the killings of the usa army to nazi germany is that we realize there are morally relevant factors that apply or do not apply to different situations and thus one situation even though they may have some things in common even killing does not necessarily mean they are morally equivalent 
more than  of all abortions are simply done by women who do not want to live with the consequences of their actions 
when the nazis killed millions of jews it was not because it was necessary to maintain bodily rights of the kind as argued for in the violinist analogy 
the point is not even the pro life anti choicer believes in such a simplistic absolute right to life and if such a person was to selectively apply such an absolute right to life to justify denying an abortion would be a double standard hypocritical 
life is precious therefore women can not have an abortion and for the purposes of this debate can not have an abortion in the embryonic period is a huge leap 
if con finds the numbers to high for their liking there are things that have being shown to lower abortion rates which do not require forcing women to continue pregnancy those things fit under the umbrella term more commonly known as the empowerment of women 
i maintain this is best explained because such things as self awareness intelligence ability to feel pain are the factors rightly one should take into consideration 
i reject even the slightest hint that forced continuation of pregnancy is justified because to allow abortion means a pregnant woman is getting away with something and thus to ensure that such a woman does not get away with what ever it is you think she is getting away with forced continuation of pregnancy is assumed justified 
con also did not seem to dispute we should recognize self aware intelligent aliens as persons using such a criteria 
for example sex education for women and by sex education i mean real sex education not say an abstinence only sex agenda that deliberately withholds vital information within the subject area 
if abortion is murder reducto argument if it is the case that abortion in the embryonic stage is equivalent to murder as some anti choicers assert then that means all women who have had an abortion in that period should all be in jail doing sentences for murder maybe even the death penalty as well as any future women who will have an abortion in the embryonic period 
they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own 
so here is the logical point if rights and freedoms are such that we can not force the billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few millions to save thinking feeling self aware humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily rights and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos 
like wise it is argued a pregnant women can unplug the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with her pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep them alive such is yours hers bodily rights freedom 
all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus for my purposes in this debate the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person 
the point is not even the pro life anti choicer believes in such a simplistic absolute right to life and if such a person was to selectively apply such an absolute right to life to justify denying an abortion would be a double standard hypocritical 
or  reject such a conclusion based on the realization that abortion is murder in the embryonic stage is false premise to begin with 
but as i argue they are not equal the  year old child not only trumps one  day human embryo it even trumps one hundred 
i consider this claim to be so obvious that i think anyone who denied it and claimed that a being which satisfied none of   was a person all the same would thereby demonstrate that he had no notion at all of what a person is perhaps because he had confused the concept of a person with that of genetic humanity 
 day human embryo is not morally equivalent to a human  year old childconsider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door are   day human embryos behind another a  year old child 
pregnant women vs billionaires dis proportionality argument the pro life forced continuation of pregnancy advocates insist their because is just noble as they are out to save lives 
definitions explanations restricted abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy

all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus for my purposes in this debate the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person 
the logical point is that any anti abortion argument that is built upon such an absolute right to life right not to be killed has at it is foundation a false premise and can be rejected as such not to mention the double standard of selectively applying it in the case of pregnancy to deny abortion rights 
so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos 
now consider the burden being imposed or argued to be imposed on a pregnant woman from the moment of contraception that being she should be forced to continue even against her will for a period of around  months 
for example we do not consider it an unjust burden to demand enforce that people do not poison the water supply but we would consider it an unjust burden to say restrict people to only wearing thick wool coats no matter how hot it is 
in the embryonic period the human organism has no current capacity to have an active or ideal desire an ideal desire being a desire which would exist had there not being a cognitive distortion 
a case for unequal moral  year old child vs   human embryosconsider the following you arrive at a burning building behind one door are   day human embryos behind another a  year old child 
but as i argue they are not equal the  year old child not only trumps one  day human embryo it even trumps one hundred 
like wise it is argued a pregnant women can take action to be unplugged from the embryo inside of her she should not be forced to continue with her pregnancy anymore than some one plugged into the violinist to keep them alive such is yours hers bodily rights freedom 
con wrongly asserts that i assume a woman should not be allowed an abortion after the embryonic period as their counter arguments that rests upon that false assumption do not apply here 
 mother vs fetus also consider a pregnancy where complications are such that either the woman or fetus can live but not both and fail to act means both die 
the logical point is that any anti abortion argument that is built upon such an absolute right to life right not to be killed has at it is foundation a false premise and can be rejected as such not to mention the double standard of selectively applying it in the case of pregnancy to deny abortion rights 
also consider a pregnancy where complications are such that either the woman or fetus can live but not both and fail to act means both die

freedom not restricted unless justifiedcon seems to agree with the point here and seeks to establish that abortion is murder in the embryonic period to justify not allowing such an abortion by a pregnant woman 
i am open to the idea that maybe abortion should be more restricted in the later stages but being open to that possibility is not the same as just assuming it i would need to see arguments in support such a thing that can withstand critical scrutiny 
if abortion is murder reducto argument recall here how i argued that if you accept the abortion is murder premise and apply it consistency and follow it is logic where it gets you mass incarceration of woman death penalty where applicable who have had an abortion in the embryonic period 
also consider if such an abortion is viewed as murder the rapist gets convicted of rape but following after is the woman who he raped is now in court because she had such an abortion and thus gets convicted of murder 
con thinks this is wrong because they are assuming that any and all human organisms make it a person because of its humanity i do not think that is tenable for the following reasons 
in the embryonic period the human organism has no current capacity to have an active or ideal desire an ideal desire being a desire which would exist had there not being a cognitive distortion 
the argument here still is that the human organism in the embryonic period is not a person and thus does not have a right to life however that right is defined 
this is pro life pro the life of the woman and so respects the dignity of life 
I am sure it would 
abortion should not be legal in any circumstances because if it were legal then it would unleash the evil entity known as cthulhu from the pacific ocean and would lead to  years of darkness for all of humanity 
i was actually working on a paper for school on this very topic and just failed to find the time to respond 
to think that the lives of infants are of special value because infants are small and cute is on a par with thinking that a baby seal with its soft white fur coat and large round eyes deserves greater protection than a gorilla who lacks these qualities 
in order to address my opponent s arguments I will split them into the major reactions the criticisms of my case the substance view and the potentiality argument which my opponent has dubbed the flo 
regarding the boring issue of technicality namely sources whilst i do not hold it against my opponent as it was entirely accidental i am sure he has misrepresented a source and thereby strawanned again mistakenly singer s position and as such i feel this ought to be kept in account 
singer himself universally acknowledged as one of the most important bioethicists of our time cannot teach in germany any more due to the attacks done on him and the lectures he has hosted by his opponents 
to conclude i shall reiterate the words of pro life advocate john noonan life itself is a matter of probabilities if a spermatozoon is destroyed one destroys a being which had a chance of far less than  in  million of developing into a reasoning being possessed of the genetic code a heart and other organs and capable of pain 
so any theory which claims the life of a fertilised egg is worth more than a human person needs to be rejected instinctively 
however the importance is that all we need to claim to demonstrate that a fetus is not a person is that any being which satisfies none of   is certainly not a person 
in fact as taxonomy is entirely vague and arbitrary we might as well include apes and others they share our genetic type very strongly 
to claim this says it is acceptable to kill all newborn infants is a complete misrepresentation which only can come from a misrepresentation of his position by those wishing to slight him of which there are many or worse a purposeful malice 
to add the context to the quote the paragraph goes in thinking about this matter we should put aside feelings based on the small helpless and sometimes cute appearance of human infants 
my opponent s ethical theory should be held to the same standard and dismissed on the same ground 
the opponents however are not pro lifers but instead the disabled community who attack his position 
and finally the episodic problem again does not exist when we realise that one is still has characteristics    and  when asleep and   and  when in a coma of warren s code 
this is a tragedy and if banning abortion does not reduce the abortion rate but instead increases the rate of unsafe abortions then making it illegal is immoral clearly i am sure my opponent will agree with me on this issue 
when we consider that with natural births if pregnancy is diagnosed within  days of fertilisation the probability of birth is  to  are we to say natural children are  times more valuable 
however surely one can argue that while it does not have the actuality of personhood it can the potentiality of personhood and that is what is important 
if abortion is wrong only because it deprives the world of a future person then abortion in this case is not wrong but merely a delay of a life and for the reason of helping many more people 
the first is that abortion does not necessarily deprive the world of a rational and self conscious being 
the science of ivf is a wonder that has allowed us to understand how life develops from a sperm and egg 
the vast majority of abortions a procedure to end the potential life of a child come through the use of the morning after pill 
 the probability of a child resulting from a given embryo is  and the probability of a child resulting from an egg that has been placed in a fluid to which sperm has been added is  we learn firstly that the potential of an ivf produced embryo is only  
of course this is severely important in public policy and still an existent issue according to charlottle byrne they just throw the baby in the bin 
considering a large share of abortions are done with the reasoning I am not ready yet we ought to take into account how many are simply delaying 
the first of two drugs was administered then and today dorothy will receive the second 
therefore it cannot possibly be classified as a person with the rights of a person 
for consider an alien species coming to earth with the same if not more developed code of society culture ethics and philosophy than us 
in fact if the world is overpopulated as many would argue then abortion is no worse than other means of preventing potential people being born 
 so if the embryo is a potential person why are not the egg and sperm considered jointly also a potential person 
the resolution is as it stands 
they do not gain the ultimate right that of voice in government until they are  
 in the mythical world you would live in a  yr old would be thrown into the streets to fend for him herself and a  old can do as he pleases and if he is harmed so be it there is no moral obligation of the parent to see no harm comes to their child and to you the harm to a child is justice for the child actions 
the law says that your parents are responsible for your education health and well being 
 the body of law as it applies to minors is based on the constitution however as a minor you are subject to the instructions and policies set forth by your parents 
see my  on the nature of rights 
they are not allowed to work at any regular job nor are they allowed to drive until  in most states and some are moving that up to  
that ought to establish that aristotle too is not a valid reference for the rights of man 
parental authority in operating an orderly household trumps all else if these conditions are met 
you cannot disprove the notion that x has a given right by pointing out that the laws do not respect those rights 
if the law contradicts this the law loses because law is subordinate to morality in any philosophical system not the other way around 
the fact that the law currently enslaves minors is not a demonstration that it should 
the law says that your parents are responsible for your education health and well being 
again law subordinate to morality therefore this is not a valid point 
lowering the number of years they have lived to below  does not magically change this 
so long as this human respects these requirements in others it is rational of you to respect the same it is in short a 
neither a parent nor a court has any claim on any of this unless the in question has agreed to a contract to the effect that it does

there is no problem with you not writing out all other trivial reasons that would make animal killing unjustifiable because those reasons would just be waste of time to mention since we both know what they are and we both understand each other and I am pretty sure our readers imagination is fertile enough to think of other cruel ways to kill animals 
again this comes from the bible which i know has no meaning to you so i can easily understand why this point would seem completely ridiculous 
it results in whether or not you think it is absolutely necessary for the woman to have an abortion 
by showing that your morals contradict i am able to prove my point without discussing the morality of the argument indeed i did not have to go into issues of morality to prove you wrong 
the way i manage to avoid the morality of the issue is by taking morals that you already have and using them to my own advantage 
honestly I am a bit unclear as to what you mean by this statement 
the point is not ridiculous at all even if i do not believe that the bible is always right 
this is why and i just realized it is dangerous to use and on the debate topic since it gives people more angles of attack 
as i hope you see however we can not really do anything about them 
however i would like to make a vain attempt at convincing you that abortion should be legal from a biblical standpoint even if the existence of god has not yet been proven 
if you convince me that god exists i will happily take this assertion for granted 
thus can not abortion up to the  day be reconciled with your religious beliefs 
you can see that a pro life website at confirms this 
the argument does not depend on the  century itself i merely tried to use it as analogous to that with no alternatives in order to explain my point 
nevertheless in the case i found myself in that scenario i would still insist that the course of action would be for her to get an abortion 
even if you were a vegetarian why would the issue of abortion be more pressing than these animals when the amount of animals slaughtered for consumption is notably greater than the fetuses being aborted in addition to the fact that the animals consumed are fully formed 
on the other hand i think that discussing the morality of killing someone is superfluous when it comes to this issue since the issue can be cut off altogether without raising questions of morality as i will now proceed to explain 
if you have any questions or something is unclear please bring that up as well 
the demand for adoption is not great enough to meet the supply already 
if you wish to challenge the reasoning behind which i arrived at my view on the death penalty please fire away 
the death penalty however might have been justified in the times of louis xvi and marie antoinette because at the time there were no other forms of securing the usurpers from harming the population such as by putting them in secure prisons 
i could go on writing on this issue but since at the end of the line we both agree I will leave the decision of continuing this discussion up to you 
but the reason this is done is not because it is the governments duty administer retribution the reason we punish those who break the law is because this is necessary to keep society safe which is precisely the governments job 
all of these points prove that women should be allowed to receive an abortion under the constitution and that women who receive abortion gain numerous benefits from it along with lowering the crime rates among other things 
i would strongly encourage a vote for con in this debate 
abortion reduces crime because and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion 
i look forward to your conclusion and hope we can be friends hereafter 
i thank my opponent for this wonderful debate and look forward to debating with him in the near future 
the same study found that women unable to obtain abortions were more likely to stay in a relationship with an abusive partner than women who had an abortion and were more than twice as likely to become victims of domestic violence 
a university of california at san francisco study found that women who were turned away from abortion clinics because they had passed the gestational limit imposed by the clinic were three times more likely to be below the poverty level two years later than women who were able to obtain abortions 
according to a study co written by freakonomics co author steven d levitt phd and published in the peer reviewed quarterly journal of economics 
  john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that 
 it is for the reasons that i have stated above and in my previous speech that i would encourage a vote against the resolution 
in addition to the whole thing many women particularly teens are shunned and shamed for their pregnancies not only by friends families employers and classmates but also by advertisements in the subway 
giving birth is dangerous too in the united states pregnancy complications are the sixth most common because of death for women between the ages of  and  
thank you for your rebuttals evangelistic omega and i applaud you on staying away from my strengths in the art of debating and identifying them before the debate 
because and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion 
i will now first like to defeat any religious arguments on this debate with this fact although the catholic and lutheran churches oppose abortion more of their members believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases versus illegal in all or most cases  vs

in short there are a lot of reasons a woman might seek an abortion 
i look forward to my opponents rebuttals and speech in the next round 
until we can say that you will not get a baby is you use this super condem or any other form of  effective birth control we should not take abortions away 
we shou d be attempting as a society to produce children that are wholesome and grow up in a happy and healthy household with both parents who care for them as that will produce the best results for a society to grow 
i would like to now point out that by requesting an abortion the mother is stating that she cannot care for does not want or cannot have the child inside her body 
i will go more in depth into this later on in the debate 
well it is because we need to offer the women a foolproof option of getting rid of a child that will not be loved cared for and was a stake weather by not having it made in the first place or by cutting it off before it is born 
coupled with the html  error and the bell internet crash in canada i have not had ddo for around  hours 
so with  minutes left till i forfeit the round and most probably the debate i will post my argument 
abortion is defined as the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy usually during the first  weeks 
i cannot make my argument this round 
also since it is mybelief that men should not rape women if i were a pharmacist would i have a right to deny a man his viagra just in case he uses it to rape 
having another member of the family is extremely expensive i am sure there are stats on this but without internet i cannot check them and it should not be forced on people governments should stay out of the bedroom 
until we can say that you will not get a baby is you use this super condem or any other form of  effective birth control we should not take abortions away

i will go more in depth into this later on in the debate 
the united states has already risen over the religious institutions in legalising gay marriage which is a very big step in the direction of the free mind and body movement 
well it is because we need to offer the women a foolproof option of getting rid of a child that will not be loved cared for and was a stake weather by not having it made in the first place or by cutting it off before it is born 
or the child could be put into an orphanage a drain on the system never knowing its mother depressed and lonely

 forfeiting means an automatic loss unless deemed okay by both sides

jesse jackson you s civil rights activist now in favor of legal abortion in national right to life news january  there are those who argue that the right to privacy is of higher order than the right to life 
the woman may ordinarily have a reasonable right to control her own body but this does not confer on her the entirely separate and insupportable right to decide whether another human lives or dies 
all other rights including the mother s right to choice surely stem from a prior right to life if you have no right to any life then how do you have a right to an autonomous one 
iia dolphins and bonobos are among a few animal species i do believe should be protected by stricter laws as they have exhibited a higher level of intelligence than other animals

I would like to point that i do not believe it is a condition to live in because of the mental capacity of the person 
regardless of whether or not the child is not more intelligent because he she is not developed enough to be or simply just has not been exposed to or taught enough the fact remains that humans have a much higher capability for knowledge than dolphins 
while they may not classify as human they share the same genetic code so you can see why applying laws based on genetics is flawed 
here is where you may object to say that the fetus as a life that will develop into a human has potential for sentience and humanity and the application of laws to it 
 specifically I would like to note that i believe the moment the fetus becomes a life is when the fetus brain starts emitting eegs or brain waves which usually occurs between the  and  weeks of pregnancy that is towards the end of the second trimester 
as i stand i do not believe there are any legal or ethical dilemmas in abortions in the first and second trimesters and I am content with simply shooting a bush 
so then should the rights of the fetus not lie within its stage of development making it a more punishable offense the later stage in its life you abort it 
they do not apply to creatures such as cows which are not as intelligent or developed as humans 
i see no ethical dilemma in abortion as the development of the fetus is insufficient and the function of the body systems is greatly impaired 
i was reluctant to take this debate because the only other one I have had on this site is also on abortion 
if that was the case a single human cell or any bacteria spliced with human dna would be identified as human life 
the cerebrum the part of the brain that makes the most difference in distinction from animals and in life functioning is the last part of a fetus to develop 
but i believe that the limit now on abortion is fine 
they both do not have feelings but it is the parental attachment 
 weeks and the baby is barely developed is what i meant 
have you ever listened to the song brick 
she is now  but when she was  she was pregnant 
now she is forced to drop out of school ruin all chances she has at getting a job and is a mess 
i srongly disagree with the topic as it is a hard decision to make and many people require more than  weeks 
but the thing is it took you  weeks to decide and you only found out she was pregnant on the  week 
if pro had in fact read my argument he would have seen that i said that a fetus was a ball of cells up to a certain point 
this still however does not qualify as a human being 
furthermore pointing out arguments i could have made is not advancing the debate it is in fact helping me 
this argument is important in explaining that abortion is not about a malicious desire to or even to express their right to choose it is about allowing women to make the best choice 
in my side i am saying that abortion should be legalize because you my have seen various disasters which have been taken place because no correct guardian for children if the abortion is not legalize what happen many children become poor some children may not have a good father or a mother 
so i think the abortion should be legalize because for example if there is a mother with a lesser earning and have got a devorse from his husband how can she give a birth suppose there are no good relatives also so how can she give a birth to a child 
yes i do believe my mother had the right to abort me especially because i suffered brain damage at birth due to oxygen deprivation i believe she had more right to have me killed than anyone else infact and a lot of the time i think it would of been better if she did infact kill me 
I am pretty sure when god created me he made a mistake i mean i did die during birth and was resuscitated by the doctors at the hospital 
i would add to these reasons of course bodily autonomy women and girls own themselves and it would be categorically wrong to impose upon them the onus of not being able to control their own bodies or to impose a moral view on them when in reality morality is far more complex 
in the process he provides several unique reasons as to why people should be allowed to have abortions a people make stupid decisions b they may not be able to take care of it c not allowing it may breed resentment amongst parents toward their children and d it may ruin a young girls life 
con writes i think so most people make stupid decisions in their life especially in high school where they can not think about the future and if they do have children can they take care of it 
i do not really think i have anything to argue against yet 
it is difficult to elaborate without knowing what my opened means by force and as this is  round debate i will allow him the next round to clarify 
it is not justifiable for example the punch a woman in the face to prevent her from going to an abortion clinic and in such places where abortion is legalised it is just plain stupid to think that such an action is justifiable 
my opponents argument is that it is justifiable to use force as this has not been elaborated on I am going to assume it is against the mother or maybe even the doctor because killing a fetus is in the eyes of my opponent is essentially killing an innocent person the prevention of which is deemed morally necessary 
i accept good luck and may the best debater win 
now the question to abort the baby is a difficult issue also i am a man and do not fully understand the emotions of a woman who have been raped it goes without saying she should not have a living breathing reminder of that experience 
a woman who is raped and impregnated should not be forced to have that baby 
with that being said many will argue that the child should not have to pay for the sins of the rapist but no one should have to raise a child born from an unfortunate event like that 
it is not murder if a cluster of cells that might develop into a human is being exterminated 
also do note that it would likely become another orphan there is not much being done abour orphanage like i stated in round  
it should not be illegal to prevent a teenage girl whom would feel abortion is less of a harm to them than pre mature pregnancy 
many teenage girls comply with the fact on abortion and rape victims would rather have one 
if developed nations like usa or australlia have the technology for safe abortions and such why should we revert to the ways of undeveloped nations such as india or iraq 
while this could possibly be true for some woman remember for many woman avoiding pregnancy especially at a young age would because less damage to them 
pro is then implying that a dead person is not treated well and has a history of consciousness 
also a sperm does not simply die when it fertilizes an egg it simply merges with it and combines dna 
i also mentioned in my arguments on why a history of consciousness is valid to the abortion debate 
killing disordered people outside the womb is not equal to aborting them when they are not a developed human being 
he then goes on to state that abortion is murder thus making every possible benefit of abortion wrong 
i know there are rape children that are alive and living perfectly fine i just brought it up as a small point nothing too relevant 
it would be a very emotionally bad experience for her and she can not even do anything about it abortion is illegal 
i understand that going around killing people with disorders is very bad but abortion is different as i have explained 
 this prevalence translates into an estimated case fatality rate of  deaths per   unsafe abortions which is hundreds of times higher than that for safe legal abortion in developed nations 
anyhows discussing the realitivity of morals is another debate as this debate is focused on abortion 
philocat can argue his points but he will never even truley understand what it is like to be pregnany pre maturely 
because of natural selection failing to work humans should take on the course of improving the genepool in non cruel ways 
a young term embryo fetus shows little to no signs of brain activity they do not have a consciousness 
morals are just a made up concept in your head nothing else 
it is also cruel to risk a womans health possibly life because they disagree with one on abortion 
while on a topic like abortion relying on biased sources for arguments is not bad 
if a young teenage girl was suffering from pregnancy and writing this she could go in much more depth and detail than i ever could 
worldwide an estimated   women die as a result of complications from unsafe induced abortions every year about eight per hour 
consciousnessa fetus embryo that is not conscious and far from being a developed human is relevant to be gotten rid of in some cases 
more importantly a teenage has a history of consciousness 
rebuttal  kantian ethics it seems odd that one would appeal to john stuart mills ethical system and then right afterwards immanuel kants as the two men definitely disagreed on matters of ethics 
rebuttal  adoption as an alternative in the case of rape my opponent finally argues that abortion would still be a punishment to the baby even though no punishment is inferred on the part of the mother 
it has been noted that my opponent has argued that we do not legalize things based on them being a detriment to society but rather for the basis of immorality which really is like answering a question with a question 
rebuttal  justification for killing my opponent has only granted one instance for ending another life which is self defense or i guess the health of the mother in aborting a baby 
rebuttal  moral consistency i will simply charge that i do not think my opponent has sufficiently determined why one must be consistent 
this ethical system makes presuppositions about the metaphysical nature of mankind and thus based on these assumptions makes man the one who determines morality makes it contradictory to then assert that morality is a priori 
in my opinion this brings up a fatal hole in my opponents argument in that murder requires malice aforethought and if it does not apply in the context he allows why then does it apply in other situations 
my opponent has charged me with committing the appeal to extremes fallacy which to me demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of this fallacy 
the fetus can only develop consciousness after a brain has been developed and prior to this time there is no potential for consciousness to arise 
rebuttal  anencephalic baby my opponent agrees that there is no instrumental purpose for keeping the anencephalic baby alive but then argues that this basis would allow for the euthanizing of the elderly 
argument  the value of human beings is not in the fact of life being a living organism but rather in the ability to have consciousness and experience pain and joy 
another point he brings up is that abortion causes more fetal deaths than female deaths and thus criminalizing it is justified 
yet no one thinks of abortion as a punishment for the fetus but rather it would seem like a punishment to the mother to be confined to raise this rapists child 
the patient has no conscious experience or hope of cognitive functions as it has no brain what quality of life would there be to preserve 
my opponent also argues that aborting such fetuses give credence to those who would want to kill those that have already been born 
in the case of anencephaly i see no problem in terminating life support if it is the wishes of the parent but in cases where the baby is conscious then there is a difference as consciousness is what i noted as valuable 
on the issue of rape or incest my opponent says that the child is not guilty of the fathers crime and thus not liable to punishment 
i appealed to the fact that the fetus had no consciousness or hope of consciousness and would likely die soon after being born 
there is clear harm in this in that the women would not have freedom over her own body but would be subjected to her fate once impregnated by the rapist to endure pregnancy and raising that undesired child 
the person in the temporary coma can also communicate prior what their will would be for the situation while the fetus can only depend on the will of the mother in whom it inhabits 
having a child is a huge potential burden and the harm of allowing a child into the world where it is unwanted or cannot be taken care of will only produce more harm 
rebuttal  criminalizing abortions my opponent argues that because women choose to have abortions the harm they receive on account of that through illegal means should not be a justification 
what he does claim is that no rational human being would freely consent to live in a society that permitted the killing of human beings yet every society on the planet does consent the killing of human beings 
or that a women seeking abortion for the case of rape would be justly killed on account of her seeking out an abortion 
 an abortion is also a way to remove one of the consequences of the rape nothing can undo the harm of that rape however it should be the choice of the woman whether or not to keep the rapists child 
 this is of course and assumed point as it is not substantiated why moral assertions must be consistent or even that we should only treat others as we would consent to be treated 
hi philocat i accept this debate and also accept that the burden of proof is shared 
i do not agree that a fetus has to pass some sort of milestone marker in order to gain value in this world because that would mean the fetus value depends on its ability to feel which is not at all a very scientific or ethical way to determine value 
we do agree on the fact that a newborn baby has the same value as an adult 
but where you say that the line should be drawn when the fetus attains the same amount of value as a fully developed being I would like to raise the argument that a newly conceived fetus has the same amount of value as an adult human being thus disagreeing with your first sentence 
so what I have gleaned from your stance is that you think abortions should be legal as long as the fetus is not caused pain 
it sounds like value and what that includes determines the weight on the scales of a mothers desires vs 
my post was designed to lead pro abortionists in to an inescapable conclusion namely that abortion is indeed the homicide of a human being or at the least to concede that their position is illogical 
but specifically i wanted to ask the question why it only becomes murder when the mother wants the child 
as best i can tell you are not the right person to be debating because you and i are actually in agreement 
to transform a fetus into a baby and then send it out into a world where the parents can have no assurance that it will be well loved and cared for is for pro choice people the height of moral irresponsibility 
saying that women or girls do not deserve to live is sexist 
i have been very clear about what i meant 
it is possible to choose the gender of your child through sperm seperation if you want to do that 
i believe it is sexist and wrong to murder baby girls for their gender 
why should gender or race matter whether someone has the right to live 
i say no you say yes make the first move 
when considering the amount of abortions that take place in illegal countries it is not a stretch to say that at least  of those abortions would still take place criminally or   if abortion were outlawed in the you s thus my opponent needs to prove the abortion crime effect in his favor that it increases crime to win the debate 
yet the only link he gives to crime is a slight increase in murder of  i was unable to access the first source so i could be wrong 
the earliest abortion statistics i could find were from  when  
another flaw in his analysis is that my opponent asserts that because of its legality there are more abortions occurring than if it were illegal which i would agree with 
measuring the crime of potential lives is drastically harder than even finding how many uncaught illegal abortions occurred before roe v wade so i will assume that unborn children have no effect on the crime rate for arguments sake 
i tried to go a different route but now i will also use various statistical arguments to point out the abortion crime effect which brings me to  my first argument had nothing to do with the abortion crime effect but rather abortion itself 
he could offer a much lower number of illegal abortions that would occur than mine but he would still need to prove the abortion crime effect in his favor 
if he cannot somehow correlate   crimes to the legalization of abortion than this would prove that the illegalization of abortion increases crime since all those women getting illegal abortions would count as crime which is merely stating the resolution in the negative 
it is important to note that crime does not have to be witnessed or caught to be considered crime which is the inherent flaw of criminal statistics they cannot point out crimes that were never found out 
for instance let us suppose in this magical country known as a there were  cases of crime or breaking of the law  counts of murder  counts of stealing and  counts of abortion this is really simplified 
if i can prove in just one case that abortion lowers crime than the resolution is affirmed while you as con must negate every instance i provide 
for my first round i will only post one argument since you do not specify whether i have to provide my entire case in the first round and will not post any argument in the last round 
the next year abortion is legalized and there are  cases of crime  counts of murder and  counts of stealing 
i will include more arguments for my case in the next round 
pro states first she concedes that adoption centers are full in the you s and does not contest that this is a viable point against her argument 
i was speaking in terms of morality but the scientific question is relevant as well because pro used it as the justification for her position she said in round  
she needed to prove to us that abortion is categorically wrong and has failed to do so 
  pro did not provide adequate justification for her point on adoption clinics and why even the mere existence of them would justify imposing this burden on a mother and a family 
with my remaining character space i am going to rebuild my contentions  pro never denied that she had the burden of proof 
i merely pointed out not only that she had not backed up this point had not proven objective morality and had not established personhood and distinguished it from life 
  pro did not address the point i made about a concession on subjective morality meaning that her burden was impossible to fulfill 
again pro used an appeal to science in an attempt to justify her position but is not admitting that other people may disagree with her as to when a fetus or a zygote is a 
this of course is an appeal to objective morality when she has already conceded that it does not exist and even this point falls flat because committing an act on purpose is not necessarily out of sptie 
  pro dropped my point and how the fact that there exist gray areas is an argument for abortion being left to the people most intimately involved instead of legislated by the government 
resolution it is wrong to have an abortionthis is the resolution and pro had the entirety of the bop to prove to us that abortion is in all cases categorically wrong 
the minimum character limit has to go 
objection number  would work if i caused damage to someone and because of that damage that person needed a bone marrow transplant then he would have the right to take my bone marrow without my permission however this is not the case with abortion the mother caused no damage to the fetus in fact she did just the opposite she brought the fetus into a state of being from non existence 
however for the sake of an interesting debate i will concede this contention and agree with my opponent that an embryo as well as a fetus is a complete full fledged person with  human rights 
the doctor had causality of dependence on his patient yet he is still not obligated to donate his bone marrow 
abortion cuts up little babies it does not just take them out of the womb to sever the nutrients from the mother 
i will concede the point that these forms of abortions are wrong 
therefore objection  does not give the fetus the right to forcibly take nutrients from the mothers body without the permission of the mother anymore than the patient has the right to forcibly take nutrients from the doctor in the case listed above 
likewise the doctor did not have damage on his hands and therefore he is exempt from giving up his bone marrow to his patient 
if i needed a bone marrow transplant and only one other person on the entire planet had a perfect bone marrow match and i needed her bone marrow to save my life do i have the right to forcibly take her bone marrow 
if a doctor performs an operation that saves a persons life and because of that operation the person will need a bone marrow transplant in  years can the patient now force the doctor to give up his bone marrow without the doctors permission 
are you willing to look a child of a rapist in the eyes everyday for the next  years of your life 
 not unless there is a breakthrough in modern technology and you are able too 
 this means you will never give birth 
 congrats you win free control over every womans body 
about the size of a one year old 
 are you a woman 
not become homeless or something stupid like what you said 
there will not be any survivors to be in prision 
i have been deing to redeem myself and this is the perfect oppurtunity 
extend arguments and  
thus everything he said is meaningless because i attack the idea that a fetus in the first trimester is a human 
first off i want voters to notice that my opponent is trying to argue that all abortion should be illegal because if not then he would have clarified so 
therefore if i provide him with one case where abortion should be legal i win this debate 
there are many examples of the bombing of planned parenthood abortion clinics and the harassment of abortion workers 
abortion is just a women getting rid of a part of her body like and appendix but what people do not realize is that people who get abortions are setting the future to what is going to be and people against abortions are living in the times 
would not it be better if the future child was not born if it is mother was to young to take care of it 
some women were raped and got pregnant because of it and just wanted to get rid of the thought 
it it is a womens choice if they want to have their baby or not 
it was a good debate thank you 
every individual has the potential to contribute in one way or another and taking the childs life before it has even had a chance to experience and contribute to the world undermines that potential 
lastly if con wants to just reject such bodily rights as mere assertions and not objectively established then the same can be done to their right to life how ever that right is defined assertions and arguments that operate on such an assumption 
a case for unequal value  year old child vs   human embryos yes they are human in the genetic sense all human organisms are human in that sense contra any implications from con that i suggest otherwise 
so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the sufferings dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos 
it may come as a surprise to some pro lifers but a woman becoming pregnant does not strip her of any and all rights especially rights concerning the use of one owns body rights even pro lifers take for granted for themselves 
in cons examples it is your own child at stake and yes we may take such action even saving our own  child over  not our own child this only shows that when our emotions something more primal is influencing our decision our rationality gets compromised but take such a situation where rationality is not comprised we save  children over  save one  year old over   day human embryos 
alot of what con has to say is very general eg right to life value of humans as such these things could even be accepted for my side of the debate and in such a general sense do nothing to refute early abortion should legal 
if i agree to take you on an airplane ride under the obligation that i will not at   feet i cannot change my mind and toss you out because i have given up my ownership of the airplane to that extent 
if i agreed to work for you for a year for free and then change my mind the most you can do is demand material property as compensation you cannot enslave me without aggressing against my rightsin using a mother s body against her will a fetus carries out exactly this kind of aggression 
change cons sink hole scenario to where all children are strangers you can either save  or them or  but not all  
con bites the bullet here so there position that abortion even early abortion is murder and thus what should be done to such women is consistent as con says 
a case in point if adrian has a negative right to life against clay then clay is required to refrain from killing adrian while if adrian has a positive right to life against clay then clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of adrian 
definitions explanations early abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy 
the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age 
medical non surgical abortions using medications such as mifepristone  are available in some clinics 
con can assert that mere genetic humanity is so valuable and or grants personhood but that is all it is a mere assertion 
so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the sufferings dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos 
for example the right to life that is to say the right not to be killed god given as an absolute is untenable ergo killing something that is human is not necessarily murder 
it gets worse again for con has con established beyond mere assertion and implication that god given rights are such that a woman can not have an early abortion 
if you have to resort to such evasive tactics and disparaging remarks rather than deal with the actual argument maybe it is time to reconsider your position 
the argument still here is that rights most plausibly derive from interests desires and in the early stages of pregnancy the human organism has no such interests 
you know what is con who wants to argue early abortion is murder but when it is pointed out where this gets con just dismisses the analysis because it is too damaging for their position 
this is why we look to reason and consequence beyond just mere assertion of said rights 
 inalienability of the will your own body con does not seem to dispute that ones own body is not subject to the same restrictions as property due to the fact that you have unique control over ones own body 
no conflict of rights interests in the embryonic period con points that rapists can just assert what rights we have presumably in such a way to allow rape 
a case for unequal value  year old child vs   human embryos cons counter merely showed what happens when our rationality is comprised eg our own child is involved 
maybe i was not clear enough what i was getting at is that such a right is untenable lest we live a world where our body it is various parts can be used against our will to save some one elses life 
i maintain that without factors at play to compromise our rationality even pro lifers would have a hard time saving   day human embryos over one  year old child 
so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos 
cons negative utilitarianism the least bad for the most people under cons own moral reasoning there are arguments that can be made in support of allowing early abortion 
 mother vs fetus also consider a pregnancy where complications are such that either the woman or fetus can live but not both and fail to act means both die 
also consider if such an abortion is viewed as murder the rapist gets convicted of rape but following after is the woman who he raped is now in court because she had such an abortion and thus gets convicted of murder 
ironically con cites negative utilitarianism the least bad for the most people as an underlying moral frame work well con in your world we have to always be on guard and in fear of our body being conscripted against our will to save other people and thus i argue is against your own moral framework 
also consider that about  of zygotes do not survive to term up to half of all fertilized eggs die and are lost aborted spontaneously often unknown to the pregnant woman 
 prevention of suffering of people born into the world with various diseases conditions eg tay sachs edwards syndrome huntingtons alymphocytosis 
the argument still is that the human organism in the embryonic period is not a person 
 making abortion illegal does not stop them woman who have illegal abortions are at much greater risk of injury and death 
cons reasoning if accepted opens up the flood gates where people can have all sorts of things done to their body against their will in the name of saving others lives 
maybe con thinks this is wrong because they are assuming that any and all human organisms make it a person because of its humanity i do not think that is tenable for the following reasons 
if abortion is murder reducto argument contra con i did not say there are endless rows of women in prison for abortion what i argued for is that if abortion is murder and you are consistent and follow it to it is logical conclusion that is where it gets you 
con merely claims it is not unjust but did not explain in detail why vague sweeping notions eg apples and oranges is not a successful refutation of the argument here 
definitions explanations early abortion should be legal by this i mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy 
the embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization penetration of the egg by the sperm and continues until the end of the  week of gestation  week by embryonic age 
medical non surgical abortions using medications such as mifepristone  are available in some clinics 
i still maintain that such an abortion being murder is more plausibly false and contra con if anyone is a victim here its women who have being told and had to live under laws that presuppose this false premise 
so here is the logical point if we are not justified to imposed a burden on billionaires of the world to give up all their wealth except a few million still leaving them richer than most to save thinking feeling self aware suffering post birth humans then it would be laughable disproportionate to then argue that we are justified to force women to give up more their bodily autonomy and the dangers of pregnancy in order to save less non thinking non feeling non self aware human embryos 
the zygote is endowed with genes from two parents and thus it is diploid carrying two sets of chromosomes they are human organisms once again demonstrating the point that not all human organisms are of equal moral value 
or  reject such a conclusion based on the realization that abortion is murder in the embryonic stage is false premise to begin with 
even if science can not prove others have self awareness this does not actually refute the criteria in theory only that it has problems in practice but this is often the case on many things 
cons negative utilitarianism the least bad for the most people under cons own moral reasoning there are arguments that can be made in support of allowing early abortion 
i maintain that the   personhood criteria is at least superior to cons criteria thus the argument still is the human organism in the embryonic stage is not a person and thus does not have a right to life how ever that right is defined 
bodily rights argument the violinist analogy recall how con had previously argued that you were not allowed to disconnect from the violinist in the name of saving another life as con had argued 
 prevention of suffering of people born into the world with various diseases conditions eg tay sachs edwards syndrome huntingtons alymphocytosis 
 mother vs fetus contra con in the later stages of pregnancy some fetuses can live outside the womb 
contra con again by having an early abortion such people do not exist in the first place thus such people are not getting killed 
so yes indeed cons reasoning does open the flood gates since under their reasoning peoples bodies can be used against their will in the name of saving other lives i showed were that justification gets you con is in denial here 
this is especially important considering con has yet to make much of an argument for their own person hood criteria 
in regards to killing a fetus a fetus that is in the womans body for a certain amount of time does have a brain but it still does not know anything 
if they pay for it through fines then that still means the government is paying for it just not with taxpayer dollars 
if a woman gives birth to a child then that child could become a good person or a bad person 
this is another reason that women should be allowed to have an abortion 
if the child is not taken care of well then it could become a bad person 
the only thing the government should do is make sure the abortion is safe for the woman 
if a pregnant woman does not want to have a child than she could either have an abortion or put the baby up for adoption once it is born 
when a woman gets raped the government should pay for her to have an abortion because she should not have to pay for someone doing something terrible 
why should the woman get a consequence for her mistake by having a child when she does not want to 
i believe it is the right choice for a woman to have an abortion in cases of rape incest or if the life of the woman is danger 
so you can not say that fetuses do not want to get killed because they do not want anything 
i do not believe the government should forbid women from having an abortion in any cases 
if the government does not allow her to have an abortion than that would mean that once a woman gets pregnant she has to have a child 
if the government does not allow a woman to have an abortion then they are forcing her to have a child 
if a woman becomes pregnant and decides that she does not want to have children than why should the government force her to have it 
when ethics are concerned there is nothing wrong with expending some extra non medically required resources to ensure that women have all the information they need to make a judgement about abortion 
by saying the right to life does not apply to babies outside of the you s implying only american fetuses are relevant my opponent is discrediting the argument that all fetuses have the right to life 
pros argument is that back alley abortions would not be a problem because before the supreme court case more than  of the illegal abortions were done by medical professionals with high standing in their fields 
in the last round i explained at length why a particular level of sentience and capacity for sentience should be the standard for legal personhood 
i went on to explain that abortion should be a legal choice for women because it is risky and directly involves their body and health 
so he is saying that medical professionals are thankfully willing to perform the procedure instead of having some hack do it 
second the reason there have been few deaths from illegal abortions is because abortion is available thanks to abortion doctors and people willing to do the procedure 
however my argument is not that we should make abortion legal simply because people will do it anyway it is that it makes no sense whatsoever to make women criminals for  not violating another persons rights and  because forcing unsafe abortion kills both fetus and woman making it a nonsensical standard 
throughout the next  years until abortion became legal the same number of women each year over  million in some years continued to seek abortions out illegally 
so pro must not only prove that fetuses have the right to life but that this right means they can violate other peoples bodies against their will in order to keep living 
pro counters that fetuses have that right as well however that is a bare assertion since i am specifically arguing that they do not 
pro says non fetus stem cells exist but that is irrelevant 
essentially there is no way pro can argue that back alley abortions are not unsafe or problematic 
if the law does not legally permit us to sell our own organs the law cannot claim to have more control over how our bodies are used than we do 
i argued that other people do not have the moral or legal authority to govern our bodies even if someone elses life is on the line 
however the push to criminalize abortion and not those who need fertility treatment proves the contention is less about protecting human lives and more about controlling womens bodies 
throughout this debate I have been arguing that it is more pragmatic to keep abortion legal as well as moral because fetuses do not have the right to life 
research by legal scholar shauna prewitt indicates that the resulting continued contact with the rapist is damaging for women who keep the child which is possible because  states in the you s allow rapists to assert custody and visitation rights over children conceived through rape 
scotus decided in roe v wade that a right to privacy under the due process clause of the  amendment extended to a womans decision to have an abortion but that this right must be balanced against the states two legitimate interests in regulating abortions protecting womens health and protecting the potentiality of human life 
there is no other circumstance in which any persons body is forcibly used to keep another human being alive against their will 
for example if someone needs me to donate organs blood or plasma i cannot be legally forced to use my body to save their life even if it is my fault they need help say my drunk driving caused a car accident and their lives are now in danger because of my choices 
pro writes that females waive their right to bodily autonomy by consenting to sex 
it is the ability to feel think perceive and be self aware amongst other things that makes this important moral and legal distinction 
however the push to criminalize abortion and not those who need fertility treatment proves the contention is less about protecting human lives and more about controlling womens bodies 
however compare this to euthanasia which is the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering 
however pros standard of the right to life means women who are in specific danger due to restricted medical care or resources especially in africa and south east asia will be forced to birth children even if it means that they are likely to die and that there babies will die or be uncared for 
while adoption may be a viable option for some particularly in the you s in other parts of the world that is not necessarily the case 
abortion should be a legal choice for women because it is risky and directly involves their body and health 
fetuses arguably do not have the right to life specifically as it pertains to mandating the use of the mothers body to survive 
we do not give  year olds the legal right to drink just because they have the potential to turn  
this can be useful at treating disease and saving other human lives the lives of those already sentient 
even if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant 
indeed most people who are do not support legal measures to protect life when it comes to caring for the sick and impoverished who need care in order to survive 
the constitution has been amended  times since its inception and interpreted innumerable times by the supreme court meaning the law as written is not necessarily the way the law has ought to remain 
embryonic stem cells are of great interest to medicine and science because of their ability to develop into virtually any other cell made by the human body 
per the debate terms round  is for acceptance 
i extend all my contentions 
it is important to remind them that disabled people are still autonomous becausethey don t live inside the body of another person and suck up their nutrients 
there are no detectable brain waves that would translate to pain or fear until  weeks a point after which abortion is rare and illegal 
some animals eat poisonous plants and some even walk through spaces too small for them to crush the fetus 
simple you are hurting someone unconsensually they object to being killed and feel mortal danger and they have friends and family who will mourn 
if abortion is illegal dead people will officially have more rights than pregnant people because a dead persont be used if they aren t an organ donor 
if human sex were only for procreation the clitoris which plays a role in pleasure but no role in reproduction would not exist 
 many will claim that sex is only for pro creation therefore it s only fair to punish people for having sex with an unwanted pregnancy 
thank you and no worries 
granted the media is not the most reliable source as often it depends on which form of news media as well as the fact that it can be biased and ignore certain news in favour of others but you see rape a lot more than premature sex you also hear about it more 
initially premature sex does not have much to do with abortion premature sex would mainly be the issue of whether sexual education should be given out at young ages to teach children about that sort of thing 
out of all the rape cases I have read about i have never seen one where a rapist forces the victim to take an abortion pill 
you are saying that rather than teach the rapist not to rape you would rather force the woman through childbirth painful labour and if your premature arguments are worth anything extremely painful labour as the undeveloped children that do have sex will have to give birth using their own bodies of which all would not be ready for such a streinuous effort as childbirth and force them to then hand the baby over to the government and move on 
will every single rapist and judging by the rape culture that we are hopefully fighting there is quite a few rapists force their victim to take an abortion pill 
the proportion of people having sex without contraception will not necessarily be high just because there is abortion available 
if you think that even one type of abortion should still exist because it does not meet the definition of recall that this is pros whole case then you are voting con 
pro still fails to provide any reasoning for why a fetus which has yet to achieve personhood should be considered a person 
nor does the presence of a beating heart make a person might as well just point to any essential organ and proclaim it the essence of personhood 
he added another argument that a fetus is separate from the mother which I will address but otherwise he is left all of my arguments standing 
every cell on our bodies has human dna that does not make every cell a person 
i do not see it as the child being punished and really when the pregnancy is really early on you can not even call it human yet because it is just a ball of cells 
or what if a  old gets raped and will most likely not make it through child birth also she should not have to deal with the disapproving stares of strangers when her pregnancy is far along 
i hate forefeits urghh 
first of all when con says but provides no source defining how he was led to this conclusion nor does he back up this statement therefore it is a baseless opinion statement irrelevant as no evidence has been presented by my opposition that i can really accept as valid as there is not much i can rebutt from that statement which proves that its not really a valid argument 
con also states another one of his beliefs but does not provide any reasoning as to how this statement has anything to do with this argument over whether abortion should be legal or not 
not once are we told that a fetus which is used to define the baby in the state where they have the abortion is defined as a child and of course we can not kill children 
in the argument that my opponent posted it lists a number of huge sums about how many people die each year from abortion and continues to provide a false baseless sum that says that every second more people die from abortion then from all the people who died in   but the fact is that this is a planet of around six billion people and that is a very small amount and plus the argument provides no sources or evidence so it is clearly invalid 
to start i would like to rebutt the points in the article 
multiply  by  and every minute  poor african children die 
until my opponent brings up evidence in the contrary you have to flow this argument to my side of the debate 
not sure why my opponent is having an issue with the refusal 
my opponent has yet to try and prove that abortion is murder or that the fetus is considered to be alive at that point 
i shall go over my opponents  arguments in the order he has presented them in 
with that my opponent has no arguments left on his side 
us constitution  amendmenta lot of people site the constitution for the but the constiutional fact is that you have to be born in the united states in order for these rights to apply to you 
john j donohue and steven d levitt the quarterly journal of economics may  despite admitting to an error in one of this studys tables levitt has stated that 
unlike china the us is not able to simply harvest the organs of prisoners nor the dead without their consent 
studies by university of california found that  of the women who are turned away from abortion are likely to become unemployed on welfare compared to the  that have abortions 
a child that is not wanted and one that would because massive harm as well as dettremental effects to soceity should not have to be born into this world as it would simply just because everyone pain 
 on top of this the cdc reports that  of all pregnancies are unintended 
many people tend to site gun control or many other factors but the real solution was abortion 
so even though it may or may not be alive it is not considered a us citizen hence have constitutional rights until they are born not at conception 
they are also more likely to stay with their abusive partner leading to a higher amount of domestic violence 
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge theprivilegesorimmunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any statedeprive any person of life liberty or property withoutdueprocess of law nordeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws 
this is something that no one men women or children have to be forced to live through 
killing a devil is not murder 
under this condition a fetus must be aborted 
you are misinformed about the particularities of demonology 
I have done that 
I am talking about fetuss indwelt by demons 
i reject the idea that a woman being told by others what she can do with her body is up to them 
i must say that to ban abortion would be to ban the womans right to decide the fate of her body 
if a womans life is threatened by the birth of this child if the child is a product of rape or incest or if the child will be born into a quality of life so poor it is inhumane then the birth of this child should be decided by the mother to terminate 
it is hers and the choice is hers to painlessly terminate the baby 
i reject the idea that a child should be born regardless of what the mother wants 
there is nothing to be lostwhen a child is born his level of success will be determined by mostly environmental factors 
when a child is aborted we are not losing what could have been 
in fact we are not losing anything since there is no human being at the time of a legal abortion 
there is no living human being inside of the mother at that time and the government has no right to be in control of reproductive health 
special rights are enacted by the authority these people have submitted themselves for example you s army will prioritize the protection of you s citizen in war even though it could mean the death of innocent civilian from different country 
your argument are made with the which is deemed much smaller than the good coming toward the parents with abortion they do not have to carry burden the mothers life is safe 
meaning that if they are unlucky enough to be aborted well although this sounds cruel that is a lottery of birth and it will not know seeing that it is not alive in the first place 
right now our option are basically to either force the mothers to born the son with possible huge consequences or leave the choice at their hand 
same goes here it is true that there are those that want to take risk but we cannot generalize it for the whole society 
it means that you should also not get all the benefits of a citizen including protection your rights etc 
the same way that smoking is ruining your lungs but you can not blame the company simply because you already consented when you choose to smoke 
and rather than prioritizing half living child in a womb it is better to prioritize parents who have spent half their life paying taxes fulfilling law and basically contributing to government 
we also take some of their rights such as banning them to vote 
especially when these children are also going to have a pretty bad future seeing that their parents choose to abort them 
they are barely alive and even if they are alive they do not have the rationality making them part of society and granting them protection 
first of all the abortions mostly happen before the foetus are considered fully alive with its organs bodily function etc 
usually it is either because they are not ready to have a baby or because the mothers life are in danger 
in both scenario biggest benefit are achievable when abortion is done and seeing that i have proven to you that it is justifiable why not 
because only when you are rational you can consider yourself a member of society and consent to the idea of having a government over you and join the social contract existing there 
there is a numeric value to human life 
this is why the ceo and the vice president of large corporations always travel in separate airplanes 
it is measured in dollars 
it is weird that we have so few infant deaths in recent years no matter what the case 
according to the you s supreme court a person is to get their age when they are out of the mothers womb and breathing oxygen starting at the  mark eventually working their way up to be  years old 
i do not deny that an abortion is the snuffing of a human life however i think it should be legal under circumstances where we can prevent suffering and be merciful to those who would otherwise experience a lifetime of pain 
it is an act of mercy to allow young women a second chance without being shackled to take care of their mistake for the rest of their lives 
so in order of your arguments i will respond thusly the destruction of human life is indeed wrong 
it is an act of mercy for children who are in the womb of an alcoholic and will be born with deformities and deficiencies that could quite possibly damn them 
the argument could be made for the fact that their fate is not set in stone however i would argue further that the margin of exceptions is very thin 
but please since you started the debate you make the first argument sir madam and i will respond in kind with a rebuttal and counter argument 
conclusion abortion has kept the crime rates lower and has saved womens lives from the dangers of home abortion 
coat hangers as unpleasant as it sounds it is a method and most likely the most dangerous if the women missed the fetus and hit an internal organ that would mean the loss of the fetus and internal bleeding and injury or death of the woman 
a women could induce the abortion of the pregnancy in many ways such as coat hangers bleach alcohol and pills all of which are very dangerous to the womens health and life 
i believe that abortion is morally wrong but i do not think the government should be able to take away such personal and close rights to americans no matter what 
taking away abortion would violate traditional american ideals and values the basis that this country was built upon 
alright i guess since con has forfeited this round and has not expanded on his argument i win 
i understand that we gave the child a chance to live but there are bad mothers out there that can make a child feel like crap especially when a certain mother wanted to get rid of a certain child in the first place 
if a government is permitted to force a woman to bear a child where will the government stop 
abortion is a very personal decision made by a women that she feels is correct a majority of the time 
if there is not an end all be all right to life for any set of cells we should concede that the utility of already participating members of society should receive due deference in relation to the utility of non participating sets of cells 
we certainly do not afford and for good reason i am not trying to appeal to the status quo alone the same right to organisms that display the same faculties and behavior 
such a heuristic is appropriate because it is most likely to increase the overall utility of members of society while any heuristic that values the utility of non members does not serve society by definition 
i might argue that this concession already cedes the entire debate if any instance of abortion can be considered appropriate then abortion should be considered legal 
when we describe abortion as do we attach any qualification 
however i will attempt a more thorough address of the instigators points 
i believe I have made my case but with an absent opponent it is hard to say 
and yet again i will yield this round in hopes that my opponent will have the opportunity to post a response before the end 
again i will yield this round in hopes that my opponent will have the opportunity to post a response before the end 
i will yield this round in hopes that my opponent will have the opportunity to post a response before the end 
my point is that even though abortion is always immoral because there is sound reasoning behind allowing abortions for medical reasons we can not construct a law that would be enforceable or not jeopardize the people the exemption is intended for 
this presents a conflict for a doctor because they know that they will be in legal jeopardy even when they know that they are correct 
the con maybe surprised to see that we actually agree on many of the moral grounds 
if you are faced with both dieing or only the child dieing then you go with the only option where someone can live 
if we assume guilt in any abortion case then we require that the defence proves that the abortion was medically necessary 
this is not because either is dishonest but because medical expertise and option varies widely and is why you should always consider getting a second opinion 
such arbitrary lines are only used to comfort us when we are faced with such morally destructive decisions like abortion and to avoid legal vagueness 
it may seem logically irrational to be pro choice and hold such an objective moral view but i assure you that my view is entirely based on reason 
normally i would have to argue for either rape or the health of the mother as situations where abortion is permissible before going further but since the con has kindly yielded the health of the mother i will build upon that point 
for someone to hold a person body hostage to drain them of resource and comfort against their will even someone who is life may depend on that body is not right 
fetus may be lives and they may even be lives worth protecting but they do not get special rights to use another persons body against there will 
even in death what happens to ones body is the right of each individual 
a parasite desired by many yes but still in definition a parasite and in life and death situations it is the default position to save the mother not the child in a pregnancy 
the fact that sex can lead to procreation and the process of a pregnancy being natural does not negate the fact that a woman still has the right to decide what she wants to do with her own body and as far as a responsibility to that life i do not agree especially given the fact under law the moment that baby is born the mother can give that baby to the state and claim no responsibility for the child 
being pregnant is not some under the radar event that a woman has to or even should be excepted to do if it is not something she chooses to undergo 
 again there is a difference between deciding the fate of your own body and simply going up to another and killing them 
they may be healthy but they are in no way able to sustain their own life 
as i said earlier that the unborn are healthy and in no way need to die unless you deliberately rip them apart limb by limb and kill them 
it could not be helped to breath by any means or any other bodily function 
people have the right to have sex and sex does not always lead to a child and with modern technology of birth control and other forms of contraceptives it is not something that even has to be a part of the equation 
you dons body should not be used as a life support system against her will any more then we should rip out a person s liver to give it to someone who needs it to stay alive 
and no women should be forced to carry a pregnancy to term if she does not want it 
it s not a matter of a burden or not you have no right no matter your size or need to use my body for anything unless i give permission 
it is natural to eat but even through eating you run the risk of getting a parasite and ultimately that is what a baby is 
what i am talking about with weather a person wants to live or not is that do we even have the right to bring life into this world at all 
there is a difference between us and the unborn with or without assistance i can live unlike a new born who can t 
the first is unable to stain life due to functions of their body and the second is just simply not helping a person when there are weak 
the child may have the definition of living but their ability to understand and reason is not to a point that they would even understood that they ever lived 
and if their mother does not want the pregnancy obviously she did not mean for the child to be created either 
if a person is unable to breath well enough to sustain their own life and allowing them to pass on is different than not giving them food and water when they are not able to feed themselves 
if a parent did not want that child she only gives it to someone who would take care of it 
con seems to be saying that forcing a pregnant woman to give birth a woman who wants an abortion because they do not want a baby or can not have a baby through financial problems age etc 
to clarify i am not saying that the lives of all orphans are terrible but that is not the point 
the point is that children should have a family who wants them and cares for them at the beginning and if the woman was forced to be a mother it is most likely that they do not desire the baby much less care for it 
i think con would agree that a sperm is alive I am excluding the egg since i have yet to understand the workings of the ovary and i do not want to make false assumptions but i am pretty sure it is alive 
so does con believe that the birth of a child is not a mutual choice between both man and wife that if a man for some reason wanted many children and raped several women to do so they could not get an abortion 
what if the impregnated women are too young to support a child a bad influence or too poor 
a sperm can create a human so it must have some human dna 
he then went on to state that sperms do not have the potential to be a human or at least by themselves 
so back to the argument at hand the point i was trying to make is that murder is the conscious ending of someones human life for malicious reasons like hate or apathy but if we decide that fetuses are human since they are technically alive and part came from a human or excuse me is in a human then following that logic should not sperms and eggs be kept in the same regard as a human 
it is wrong to legalize a rule that states all pregnant woman must give birth to their child since the raped women did not have a choice in its conception 
first off when a woman is violated sexually raped and the man fails to deploy any birth control method such as condoms or medication for the woman she most likely becomes pregnant 
if this is so why can not sperms be considered humans as well 
you can not just throw them into a garbage can leave them lying on your bed or throw them into a toilet 
i never said it would be right to kill an orphan and that being an orphan is worse off than being dead 
the baby is much like a parasite even if it is born there are many complications in the postpartum of the pregnancy like many women die during childbirth more so than if they abort making many of your arguments moot 
 my opponent does not address my argument but sidesteps it by saying what warrant do i have for saying that to be considered human there is more than one criteria to be filled besides having dna 
and i pull attention to your definition because it is the parameters we agreed on it is not a semantical argument it is a practical one i did not offer a different definition nor did i try to change the meaning of the definition i simply pointed out that you were deviating from your parameters 
 many women suffer mental distress after they have a child is does that make having a child wrong 
to be considered human you have to have dna and be born because if you are not born you are not able to think or be sentient or feel a fetus can not do any of those things furthermore a baby is much like a parasite you use the word unnatural but a parasite takes nutrients by it is natural means 
 this is an appeal to consequence furthermore it does not make abortion wrong 
 this seems like an extenionsn of the third point if the women getting an abortion does die which is exteremly rare but the women decided to end her pregnancy an accepted any risk in doing it does not make abortion wrong claiming that a women might die 
a fetus has more in common with a tumor the first few weeks after a while it becomes more a parasite than anything else stealing nurtrients from it is host 
what god requires of a woman is she obey the laws of caesar the laws which her community society and culture have made for her and she must abide by her conscience and what her relationship with the divine demands of her 
he will forgive you and welcome you into his kingdom i think the pastor is right 
 pastor replied god does not believe you did anything wrong 
while the question is asked does god approve of abortion the real question is does god approve of women making their own decisions 
not a problem 
i still however support abortion but concede the fact 
my opening argument is a rebuttal and a defense for the morality of abortion along with the prima facia morality of abortion 
my opponent would have us believe that n the face of it it is morally wrong to kill another human being 
there is no reason why anyone should consider abortion as an act of self defense and prudence obliges us to assume that it is a human in the absence of any good reasons to think otherwise 
 rebuttals my opponents arguments can be summed up as followed the unborn entity from the moment of conception is a full fledged member of the human community it is prima facia morally wrong to kill any member of that community every successful abortion kills an unborn entity a full fledged member of the human community therefore every successful abortion is prima facia morally wrong conclusion as i have demonstrated an unborn entity is not a full fledged member of the human community it is not always prima facia morally wrong to kill a member of that community and every successful abortion is not always prima facia morally wrong 
it is a fact that a   month old fetus has none of the above criteria hence they cannot have a serious right to life and it is not prima facia wrong to abort the potential child 
in her essay the moral and legal status of abortion warren suggests five  criteria for a being to be qualified as a person that is protected morally and under the law  consciousness  reasoning  self motivated activity  capacity to communicate  presence of self concepts self awareness 
for example if the mothers life is at risk it is obviously not prima facia wrong for the woman to have an abortion 
philosopher judith thomas demonstrated a scenario in which a woman is kidnapped and wakes to find that she has been surgically attached to a world famous violinist who for  months needs her body to survive 
in fact it is arguable that denying the woman a right to abortion in the case of a pregnancy is morally wrong 
thus my argument can be considered the following  it is not prima facia wrong to kill a non human being 
however i ask my opponent if the adult did not have a conscious and was a vegetable so to speak how can that being have a serious right to life 
thank you david for challenging me to this debate 
a person that is murdered in cold blood does not suck nutrients from a host nor does could he because internal bleeding because severe damage to her vagina and potentially death 
a woman that is raped suffers severe psychological damage that potentially never goes away 
kinsey  p  reports one record of a seven month old infant and records of five infants under one year who were observed to masturbate 
since my opponent forfeited his last round i would ask that everyone vote for me 
give a source for those obviously ridiculous numbers in that study i linked  infants reached orgasm this does not mesh with in the entirety of the world 
the sad part is that this poor  year girl that was raped will never have a childhood because her parents were irresponsible enough to allow her to have the child 
it is not an unanswerable question the mother has personhood citizenship a name relationships and is not leaching from an umbilical chord 
in the case that the procedure kills the child in itself and unnecessarily as in partial birth abortion then it should be prohibited and certainly does violate the rights of the child 
if the pilot does not would not the property owner be justified in physically removing him from the property by force 
abortion is not necessarily an act of killing any more than the example with the apartment owner 
take the following example of this let us assume that there is a property which exists on the top of a high plateau with cliffs which drop hundreds of feet to a valley surrounding it 
but in any case the mother is just as much as the apartment owner 
it would imply that if we had a machine which could transfer then any time someone died everyone would have a responsibility to transfer some of their to ensure that person lived on 
in an act of charity a local apartment owner allows a few homeless people to seek shelter inside his building because he has a few unused rooms 
if i have a right to not have my cellphone stolen that is to say i am the legitimate owner of the cellphone then you and everyone else have a responsibility to not steal it from me 
that would mean that everyone has a responsibility an obligation to make sure i stay alive 
finally it seems the main objection my opponent has is that as a result of evicting the child from the mothers property her body the child dies 
for the purposes of this debate i would like to ask that my opponent begins with these three assumptions  all persons are legitimate self owners  life begins at conception and  all persons have the same rights 
just as a landlord may evict a tenant a woman may evict her child from her property in this case from her body 
women as self owners have complete dominion over their bodies and insofar as they do not violate the rights of anyone else they may use their bodies as they please 
a fetus in the first trimester has no consciousness and cannot feel pain it is not aware of its own existence mothers should have a choice to what happens to their body controlling birth is an efficient method of preventing human overpopulation it is cruel to force a pregnant woman to die just because the child will live longer than her it is irresponsible to force someone that cannot take care of a child to give birth my opponents arguments a full life like a newborn baby is worth more than a part life like a mother given by the equation c x q x d v where c is the chance q is the quality decrease and d is the duration 
if you believe a mother should be forced to die so that she may give birth simply because the child would live longer than she would congratulations to my opponent  
the way my opponent has fraised it a bigger decrease in quality of life would result in a higher value 
my opponents argument against this is somewhat confusing so your saying that two people that live far away from each do not have the potential to create a child 
my arguments if preventing a life due to abortion is bad then any type of birth control is equally bad you cannot murder what is not yet alive 
before i begin my final argument i would like to tally the pros vs cons of this debate that have been made so far 
i do not think my opponent realizes the dramatic effects over population would have on the human race 
before this the fetus cannot feel pain it does not know it is alive it is essentially a growth 
this is the point where the part of the fetuss brain responsible for consciousness starts to develop 
if this person is hooked up to a life support system their next of kin can legally decide to 
even if this was the case a pro choice argument can still be made 
similarly the fetus is dependent on it is mothers and has not obtained the mental capacity to make its own choices 
science estimates that the earth is only fit to handle about   billion people 
as the amount of people increase so does world hunger and poverty 
and if a fetus is considered to be a separate person then where do you draw the line 
for the sake of simplicity let us imagine that none of these questions apply 
preventing a life from forming is not the same as murder just like deciding to wear a condom is not murder 
a fertalized egg is not a person it is a sex cell and has no autonimy of it is own instead it is property of the mother just like my sperm is my own property 
what gives you the right to determine what anyone can and cannot do with their own selves 
nor is there any pre existing dormant consciousness as there would be in the case of a sleeping or comatose person 
it is a growing cell and does not even have a consciousness at the time of legal abortion 
they should not feel guilty considering the fetal brain does not begin to develop until   weeks into the pregnancy at which point it is little more than a hollow tube filled with dividing neurons 
he then argues that a fetus is still an organism but i showed to him that we kill and eat organisms everyday many times for trivial reasons 
sure having an egg and a sperm together is a step closer to having a fetus which leads to having a baby but does this exclude the notion of masturbation 
finally he argues that a fetus will eventually become a human but he has failed one of my earlier points about masturbation which i have brought up again 
it can be made implicit in my opponents argument that killing a fetus will remove it is possible future experiences as a human 
masturbation still has some of the prerequisites for a human being just not as much as a fetus 
life organism my opponent argues that since a fetus is an organism then abortion should not be legal 
i have two objections to this a life forms are not necessarily human beings 
the law should be concerned with protecting it is citizens from other citizens not to try to be a nanny 
so everything i kill a mosquito i should be imprisoned 
so if a kid procrastinates which means he is irresponsible should he be punished by law 
a person is defined in you s law as either a human being or a corporate business etc 
i do not intend to argue about abortion cases in other countries and it does not seem my opponent does either though i doubt the definitions of murder are vastly different amongst most countries 
note that definitions of laws and such will be kept under the jurisdiction of the united states 
in current united states law at the moment of birth a biological being becomes a human being 
 conclusion i argue that since a fetus is not a human being then the mothers right should be considered paramount 
i have not debated in awhile and I am bored 
additionally it is not murder therefore making the priority the womans body 
the supreme court recognizes that the state constitution of alabama which states that the people of this state have the right to go through the abortion process as long as it is not after  weeks of the pregnancy at the point when the government is seeking laws to protect this so called baby they are valuing and respecting the life of the baby 
at this point the government fails to be a democracy and a protecter of the peoples rights but an oppressor of the people and since we are looking at the united states this form of government is not what we are trying to pursue 
so now as thomas jefferson says in the preamble we the people have the obligation to take action against a form of government that is an oppressor to the people 
abortion allows the people of the society which in this case will be the united states the right to exercise there first amendment right through action 
i will try to cover as many points as i can first of all stating that it was murder for the sake of convience is simply too patronizing to what i was trying to convey abortion is an essential requirement for those who cannot afford to bring up their children as i mentioned with the poverty issue and women themselves do not ask to be raped and they are forced to concieve a child that they were probably aware that from the start they could not bring up 
b if anything prostitution and drug laws should complement abortion as there is little chance a child can be brought up properly if a prostitute gets pregnant 
however my points do link together  of abortions are made because the womans life would have been changed too much this also includes cases of rape 
i thank my opponent for posting his argument on this topic as i mentioned earlier my stance will revolve around why it is justified for a woman to willingly want to abort during pregnancy i will state my facts below and i will then leave it to con to respond accordingly 
i will argue why abortion is okay and why this justification should make it legal 
 just because the woman is no longer pregnant does not mean they are not a mother of a child but now the are the mother of a dead child 
d actual lyrics mommy that is my arm why are they tearing my arm the baby feels no pain and so would not realise that someone is tearing their arm even though doctors do not tear arms 
pro claims that the foetus is human at any point at least that is what i gather so is the ball of cells formed after the conception human as as pro claims it has the potential to be human 
  pro provdes no definition or indication of what she believes is or indeed what is a human life form 
now let us go through this statement by statement pro has provided no evidence for her views and so we are forced to take her at her word it may be their body but now they are sharing it with a whole other human life form 
that is a very interesting area and one that i will come back to next round 
 this mother has no children and it can be surmised that she does not want this ball of cells child as pro insists on labelling it their little hearts beat inside their mother 
but while we are on the subject of could have let us examine some actual statistics on the type of women most likely to have an abortion 
this is for various reasons but the most salient every baby is a gift and a blessing this gift should not be returned 
what about people who have clearly done bad in their lives and caused widespread misery and pain such as hitler stalin 
 non hispanic blacks and hispanics are most likely to be aborted as those same groups have the highest rates of unintended pregnancy 
no doubt there are deeply inhumane ways to abort but the ways we have now are humane and the baby feels no pain 
it is pointless to focus on what could have been 
pro has stated that the mothers body is not hers anymore it belongs to the nonsentient foetus 
orwelltoday com a website that is stated aim is comparing the world george orwell described in with the world we are living in today                it promotes global warming denalism and several jfk conspiracies 
 weeks which is the standard almost globally is well short of that meaning that according to our current science the fetus does not feel pain thus refuting a common argument that of the fetus feeling  my body my choice the fetus is completely dependent upon the mother while in the womb for its nutrition etc 
anyhow for those who are too lazy to read it it says in essence that at  weeks pain receptors are widespread and therefore the fetus feels pain possibly at that point 
however it goes on to say that the pain receptors are not connected to the brain until   weeks 
we give freedom in our society for people to do what they want with their body generally 
this means that the fetus can be considered a part of a mothers body 
 round points  points  rebuttal only   points pro must ff final round otherwise they lose the debate 
i am  I am not even graduated from high school my life is in so much chaos and uncertainty and i know i do not have the capability to be a mother nor should i have to carry the burden of someone elses decision within my womb 
i do not want to put him or her up for adoption either because then that baby would know me as the mother that did not love them at all or was irresponsible and i can not live with that idea either 
my life was invaded under false pretenses and thus i should not have to hold the burden of carrying this child 
the life form is not technically human yet it has not developed to that point where it can be considered human 
these conditions that have been placed onto me by forces outside of my own control is not fair 
i am pro choice i support the decision made by the woman and her right to do with her body what she chooses and believe that the choice can only be made by the one with the life within them not by outside influences 
i can not love something that only reminds me of the face and eyes of the man who raped me 
if not i hear that god if he exists takes all the aborted children and takes care of them in heaven 
i know my boyfriend sincerely believes that there is a way to get through this without aborting the child but i simply disagree with him 
if we consider these cells to be human beings then sperm cells must also be considered to be human beings and so whenever a man goes four days without having sex he has committed murder 
human life begins after twenty four weeks of conception so before that time the fetus does not have a right to a life because we cannot give human rights to non human entities 
statistics show that only  to  of women are actually depressed and guilt ridden after an abortion 
I have just been raped I have been deprived of my right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness and I have been emotionally scarred to re experience that moment over and over again in my head for the rest of my life 
on top of that the family usually does not support the mother after she gets her abortion and the loneliness does not help her cope 
yes then can be born but then they are alive and no longer part of the mother 
yes but the baby is still not alive it is still part of the mothers body and therefore has no rights 
as I have said the baby is part of the womans body and so she decides whether or not to have it 
live birth abortion is just another type of abortion and does not differ from the main point of abortion it is the mothers choice to have the baby or abort it 
it is the mothers decision no matter how far along into the pregnancy it is 
the baby is not born is not a citizen and therefore has no rights 
we still have other factors contributing to population and the population only increases with each year 
 population control is a world wide problem since we all share the same static resources on the same rock 
addressing it now is easier than addressing it when it is too late or denying it like people like to do with global warming 
my job here is done  personally i would never abort a fetus because of an unplanned pregnancy but that is just me 
 if you agree here then it sounds like i have already changed your mind 
nonetheless this was not my argument for  
 it is unfair for a rape victim to have her life disabled by an unwanted or uncontrollable pregnancy 
any subjective religious concerns regarding the soul would need to be left at the door in order to maintain separation of church and state in the us at least 
I am not necessarily pro abortion I am rather somewhere in the middle but it sounded like an interesting topic 
a full school year is tough without a pregnancy but with it the teen may have symptoms of depression 
the student will have to walk around with all the extra weight that she did not even want in the first place 
they may also have to cope with people at school talking about her 
i think that raped teenagers need to focus on school and do not have time for a baby 
having a baby is a serious commitment that takes  months 
the teenagers should focus on school so they can go to a good college if they want to 
having said that abortion seems like the easiest option in the eyes of young or poor women 
aborting a baby at an early stage of the pregnancy makes it easier when there is hardly any 
i agree that adoption is a better choice however adoption entails actually having the baby 
should a woman or young girl who is raped have to live with the consequences and reminder of what has happened for the rest of her life 
if a woman suffers an unforeseen circumstance that she has no control over she should have the option of help from the government should there be any in place 
it all boils down to personal choice whether an abortion should even be committed but at the end of the day money is being used in various branches of the economy that not everyone agrees to such as the death penalty housing inmates nuclear bombs and military service 
according to the meriam webster dictonary that has several defintions to fit all the needs of people who claim to know when life starts a the quality that distinguishes a vital and functional being from a dead body b a principle or force that is considered to underlie the distinctive quality of animate beings a the sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual both of these examples of defintions are very subjective and leave us with questions what is a principle or a force that is distinctive of animate beings 
several religious groups and persons have claimed to go against abortion because of their religion usually this religion is christiantity hosea    hosea prays for god s intervention 
ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb 
any and all arguments based on moral grounds are unacceptable when it comes to this topic 
just because someone disagrees with youvr stance on sometnig does not mean you can tell them what to do 
since this would clearly not be to our benefit the importance of potential must not be very big 
for example the  legalization of abortion in south africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion related complications with abortion related deaths dropping by more than  
the legal status of abortion is believed to play a major role in the frequency of unsafe abortion 
none of this evidence follows or aligns with almost any other scientific research done on this subject while a fetus may be a life it does not start to develop characters that humans share until around   weeks 
in fact  of all abortions in the united states are obtained within the first   weeks 
the next logical question one may ask is whether or not it is a human life 
and what about abortion in cases where it could danger a mother s life what happens in a situation where the mother could die from the pregnancy 
these are just a few facts on how many pregnancies can be fatal 
i would argue for the fact that the fetus would have to exhibit pain feelings emotion and conscious 
this varies from state to state and is also a huge reason that late term abortion is banned 
i think it should because if a woman is raped she should not have to have the baby 
abortion should be something everyone can agree with because if a woman is raped and does not want a baby she should be able to get an abortion so she will not have to be forced through motherhood 
ok what if the child was around wat if she gave him away to a foster home or if she actually did keep him he might keep reminding her about the whole session by looking like the rapist in ways also what if the rapist experienced many disabilities like psychotic abnormalities also for the child he might become very angry with the world for what he has heard and decided to end it all or start his own raping rampage yet for a girl offspring what if she wants to get back at societe by shooting up a mall or taking drugs to forget about this horrible thing on what she heard also do not forget not every child is normal the one thing that happens is the mother usually gets an abortion or sends him away 
yet what if a woman had been raped and never wanted the baby but she has no choice she will have to go through many processes that will be stressful and may even because her to gain weight which will make her less attractive which causes depression either way also what would happen to the child if he found out his mother never wanted him and his father is a rapist in jail 
i could not work up the strength to respond 
but nobody forced my parents to conceive me in order to allow me to live with a good future 
it is not a case of protecting the killed but of punishing the killer 
bodily autonomy is the reason that rape and assault are wrong 
we all deserve reproductive rights and if they would been forced to have me that would have caused more harm to them than the harm to me if I would never existed as a sentient feeling being 
it is merely a matter of protecting bodily autonomy more on that in a bit 
they are not an all or none thing lack of one does not eliminate all the other reasons 
if i think of more I will include it in the comment section mmmkay 
an abortion after that point only happens under special circumstances such as when it is killing the mother or has serious defects that will kill it and the fetus is euthanized before a  trimester abortion meaning it feels none of the abortion 
eeg suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in fetuses probably does not exist before  or  weeks a point after which abortion is rare and illegal this study asserted that withdrawal reflexes and changes in heart rates and hormone levels in response to invasive procedures are reflexes that do not indicate fetal pain 
so really taken in total aborting a fetus is like choosing to swat an obnoxious fly buzzing around or like parents choosing to pull the plug on their braindead vegetable child 
if abortion is illegal dead people will officially have more rights than pregnant people because a dead persont be used if they aren t an organ donor 
but disabled people are still autonomous because they are sentient beings and don t live inside the body of another person and suck up their nutrients 
i have the burden of presumption which is too assume that the status quo right now is working and i believe that giving soon to be mothers the choice of an abortion is good it is a free country after and the separation of state and church prevents you from placing your religion based opinion on a matter that affects an entire nation 
thousands of children are in orphanages and adoption agencies the chances of every child ever being adopted by a good family are extremely low and the chances are diminished further when you put in the fact that more children are created than are adults to take care of them 
you should have the option to do whatever you like and other than the fact that the affirmative is clinging on the fact that i he loses on all other arguments and therefore if he cannot prove his case the vote should go to the negative in this debate 
yet the american psychological association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion and that there was no evidence of post abortion syndrome 
adoption is not an alternative to abortion because it remains the womans choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption 
 risk of serious complications and do not affect a womans health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth 
in the case of rape or incest forcing a woman made pregnant by this violent act would because further psychological harm to the victim 
human life occurs at conception but fertilized eggs used for in vitro fertilization are also human lives and those not implanted are routinely thrown away 
as it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord its health is dependent on her health and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb 
often a woman is too afraid to speak up or is unaware she is pregnant thus the morning after pill is ineffective in these situations 
because my opponent has forfeited this round i thin that it is obvious that if the man is not the who is going to have to carry and take care of the bay there is no reason that he should have the final say in whether they have the abortion or not 
the woman is going to be the one who has to go through labor and take care of the child 
most families consider it to have a son as their single child because a son will look after them when they are old and because families of farmers need strong people to work for them 
however it seems like you have nothing to say about any of my arguments so far so I will wait for replies for them and move on to opposing your other points 
however if a couple really wanted a boy and there was no abortion what would they do 
also as i have already proven a fetus or an embryo has never been so it cannot be 
does this mean that all these are too important to die 
as for my previous arguments they all still stand so i will not restate them here 
as you said some parents abort when they find out that their baby will be a girl so that they can have another chance to make that single child a boy 
it cannot even feed itself or breathe it can only leach oxygen and nutrients out of its mothers bloodstream making it more of a parasite than a person and not on its own like a person which must be independent not connected with another separate colour oxford english dictionary if an embryo or a fetus has never been alive how can it be killed 
also at the point where many mothers use abortion pills to abort a few days after conception there is only a  chance that the baby will even attach itself to the uterus and even after that a  chance of miscarriage if the mother is below  or so 
as neither of these categories apply to a fetus one could safely venture that killing a fetus is not killing a person as a fetus is indeed not a person 
so you like many other faceless millions are saying that abortion is and that is why it is wrong 
well if murder is one person killing another person and a fetus or an embryo is not a person then the police are not allowing murder 
voters what is more moral a safe abortion that takes place at a time where the fetus is not a human being can not feel pain and is not conscious or having thousands of babies die painful deaths 
so in conclusion things pro needs to answer at what stage does it become murder to kill a fetus 
pro makes the same gigantic assumption that i have that the fetus is not alive and feels no pain and has no intrinsic value as pro stated without verbal reports and direct access to the mind of a fetus inferences about what fetuses are able to experience depends on the interpretation of secondary evidence 
once that signal gets into the brain the information is transmitted through a complex web of neurons to an area of the brain called the cortex she said 
the nervous system of a fetus is not developed enough to the point where it can feel pain until around the  week of pregnancy 
therefore my original argument stands since fetuses can not feel pain until the  trimester it is morally just to abort a fetus before that point to save the fetus mother and family of pain after birth 
pro asks con for evidence on why fetus equals human life well i assume pro was once a fetus and never stopped being human offspring and has just grown a bit 
rebuttals the sources of my adoption argument were a bit off and i concede that when i did more digging into the matter and found the numbers a bit different 
pros main point throughout the debate was that since fetuses can not feel pain and are not human beings it is morally just to abort them in order to stop pain after birth 
when a person is injured say you stub your toe for example a signal travels from the foot up through the nerves in the leg to the spinal cord and then from spinal cord up to the brain davis said 
while i concede this point adoption is an option and should be considered way before abortion especially if you can not afford the child 
instead of attacking the idea that abortion before a fetus is able to feel pain is moral con has instead focused in on what specific week fetuses can feel pain 
con stated the bottom link was the most informative 
is it when the mother wants to give birth if not is it worthless there needs to be a clear line drawn by pro 
con has not actually proved that a fetus is a human being merely claiming that because since fetuses grow into human beings they are human beings 
pro extends their argument from round one that since fetuses can not feel pain nor are they human beings it is morally justifiable to abort a fetus if said abortion will reduce pain to the mother father child or anyone else affected by the pregnancy 
because of that pro should win the debate as pro points out that abortions are painless to the fetus as it can not even feel pain and abortions are usually done to prevent pain after birth 
this is impossible for con to do however as all modern medical research proves fetuses are not human beings 
as discussed neuroanatomical pathways necessary for processing pain similar to those observed in adults and older children could be in place by  weeks gestation 
extension con makes several assumptions in their argument specifically that a fetus is a human being 
the stereotypical hormonal stress response of adults or older infants of about  months onwards reporting pain is observable in fetuses at  weeks gestation 
a man woman or child of the species homo sapiens distinguished from other animals by superior mental development power of articulate speech and upright stance 
 which we can stop by not treating sex as a health issue but something that you should not do until you get married and you do not have to intrude on people rights but change public opinion by the way your stats agree with my last point if we promote safe sex contraceptives are very cheap and if you want to have sex take precautions 
that might help to change your opinion to your point about fetuses not being human two human people had sexual intercourse to produce this child so it would be denying a science fact that this is not human offspring this is a quote from your last post on this debatewhile this is hard to understand i believe con is saying that because two humans were required to produce a fetus it is therefore human and should have all the rights of a human 
pro has provided an example of how fetuses can not feel pain automatically making them less then human beings 
these and other observations are taken to suggest that the fetal mind can support an experience of pain from at least  weeks gestation 
here is some data on why women get abortions percentage of women reporting that specified reasons contributed to their decision to have an abortion reason  n   having a baby would dramatically change my life  would interfere with education  would interfere with job employment career  have other children or dependents  can not afford a baby now  unmarried  student or planning to study  can not afford a baby and child care  can not afford the basic needs of life  unemployed  can not leave job to take care of a baby  would have to find a new place to live  do not want to be a single mother or having relationship problems  not enough support from husband or partner  husband or partner is unemployed  husband or partner is abusive to me or my children  have completed my childbearing  not ready for a nother child  do not want people to know i had sex or got pregnant  do not feel mature enough to raise a nother child  husband or partner wants me to have an abortion  possible problems affecting the health of the fetus  physical problem with my health  parents want me to have an abortion  was a victim of rape  became pregnant as a result of incest  
until then i argue that since fetuses can not feel pain nor are the conscious abortion is a way to prevent pain in the lives of mothers and children 
this is the definition of a man woman or child of the species homo sapiens distinguished from other animals by superior mental development power of articulate speech and upright stance 
and even if some of these women can the baby is likely going to be neglected as the women who would keep it are likely to be innmature and will not have time to properly care for their child 
thesis abortion the lawful termination of a fetus is moral and should be legal in certain scenarios and times 
the stereotypical hormonal stress response of adults or older infants of about  months onwards reporting pain is observable in fetuses at  weeks gestation 
so our options are either to have millions of babies born into poor or irresponsible homes or we can have the pregnancy terminated early so that no harm is caused to either the mom or the fetus 
fetuses can not think or feel pain in fact their brains hardly exist at all 
as discussed neuroanatomical pathways necessary for processing pain similar to those observed in adults and older children could be in place by  weeks gestation 
for example  of women or around   women yearly based on the fact that there are around  thousand abortions yearly get abortions because their partner is abusive 
these and other observations are taken to suggest that the fetal mind can support an experience of pain from at least  weeks gestation 
the fetus is not part of the woman but it does relate and can harm the women 
if we are still banning abortion then it is a harm to the mothers liberty which contradicts this framework making it illegal as liberty is the  amendment and the government needs to give the life liberty and security of ones self and does not do its job hence it is illegal 
round  as i have clearly said in my first round the fetus is no living and it does not meet all of the seven characteristics which are needed in life 
the mother has the liberty but then it cannot harm others harm principle and the fetus does not count as other because it is not a living being 
i will give the framework that i could not give last round even though there is no particular need in it 
even though abortion was not a huge because of death there are a thousand every year and that is a lot but not in percentage 
my opponent does not give any sources so technically all of the text that she gave are bare assertions 
what the opponents list is a bare assertion and many of them are in my list and the fetus does not follow it 
first of all there are illegal abortions in countries even the us is the point 
 percent of abortions are after  weeks so in the part of senstivity i will be using this  week thing not the  week thing according to the definitons as a really rare number only  
the fetus does not match all of them so the fetus does not have the right of life so we can kill it because it is not a living thing hence does not have any right or liberty so we should make abortion legal according to my framework 
the resolution is negated and abortion should be legal because the fetus has no right and is not murder if we kill it 
the  of your life is when you go to college and earn lots of money but these people need to care for the babies 
the fetus does not have the right of life so we should ban abortion by saying that abortion is murder because it is not according to my arguments and my sourced evidence so as abortion is not murder and harms the mother who has rights abortion should not be illegal or should be legal 
so there are no reasons why we should have an illegal abortion because women do produce abortions anyways and they are more dangerous so we should just have abortion legalized 
the mother has the liberty to do what her body and she does not need to care for a fetus that is not even living 
sensitivity the fetus can sense at  weeks in his earliest but as in average  weeks which is over a month before most abortions occur 
the women are not doctors so they can not produce safe abortions and they are illegal abortions 
there are  categories a living thing must have in order to be called living and if it does not even match one of the case it is not considered living 
many mothers every year die because of not having an abortion because a baby costs money and gives you stress and the mothers do not bear the stress and in the end die because of these fetus who are not even living 
argument  the right of lifethis will be my shortest argument because it is mostly explained in my previous argument but i will explain it a bit more 
as in the framework and the  argument the fetus is not living so it has no rights to life or liberty 
i respect your opinion as we are all entitled to one and i appreciate that you have respect for mine as well but either way i would appreciate if you would make a longer and more solid argument in the next round as the closing argument will be the last chance you have to make all of your points 
yes i see your point on the matter however the problem is the fact that if the mother gets pregnant and the risk of dying in child birth exists than why should the mother put her life on the line for a child she does not even want at times which is feeding off of her body and may possibly have to grow up with conditions that would hinder it from ever entering society yes i perfectly open to admitting that abortion is murder because it has been observed that the fetus is in essence alive due to the fact that at proper conception nuclear fusion occurs and makes new cells however those cells are not necessarily capable of coherent thought thus the only thing that you are killing are a group of cells that currently are residing inside the mothers womb those cells which in essence are the same kind of cells we kill on a daily basis when we wash the floor or clean the dishes or clean the bathroom or anything we are trying to get clean almost always involves the murder of cells and or bacteria we just feel different about the cells residing inside the mothers womb because they will grow into a human in later development which is fair understandable but the child those collection of cells will grow into could develop horrible mutations in its genes or will have copying errors in its dna due to the lack of genetic diversity in the case of incest 
 or may die because the mother did as well in childbirth and even then would have to suffer social issues later in its life because their parent will have either died in childbirth or would have to live in an adoption agency that has bare minimum standards for the children it cares for 
i believe that if abortion is to be conducted it must be quick and humane however i find the ideology of you saying people who abort should be put in jail and that people just should not get pregnant to be far too generalized and does not account for many different circumstances that might arise that would make the mother abort 
abortion should be legal because someone may have simply been raped and is now with a child that she does not want or simply does not have the financial support to bring up also if the mother is under age say   for argumentative purposes 
 and is raped by say a fellow family member not only is there a chance that the child will come out before the  month period that is now increased because of her age but also due to the fact that she is so young and she now has a child with such little genetic deviation that there would be severe birth defects the child ren would have to live with their entire lives 
so you agree with my statement in which abortion should stay legal and not be illegal 
in that case my argument would be the only winning side 
which supports my statement that abortion should not be illegal in other words unlawful illicit or illegitimate 
a second situation where i think abortion would be desirable would be in the case of rape victims who are impregnated through no fault of their own 
the mother would no doubt be scarred for life emotionally and as such may not be able to treat her offspring in the way in which it deserves to be treated 
imagine the emotional purgatory which would result from being raised as an only child and then being told that you never got to know your father because he was a rapist who brutally attacked the person who raised you 
i think abortion is bad only within certain circumstances thus i also think abortion can be ok or even good 
in controlled conditions it is out of the egg 
yo how you doing i liked taking a poo right now 
you know what I am mean bro 
may i point out that homework is bad so god is bad 
woah are you objectifying me 
you are sexy 
I am not here to debate something i did not sign up for 
there is no reason why a mother would abort a baby for no reason without the fathers approval unless she was raped 
pro is right when he says that unborn babies feel more pain than any of us would and that is exactly why doctors use anesthetics during abortions 
the whole purpose of anesthetics is to minimise or prevent pain from being felt which it does a good job of 
most abortions in the us are carried out are because the couple feel they cannot afford the baby the couple are concerned the baby will negatively affect their lives or that they are having trouble with their relationship and want to avoid single parenthood 
 therefore my point stands that abortions can relieve couples of future suffering and problems if they think they cannot support the child 
the person who is murdered could have had so much potential and could do so many things in his life and murder is essentially robbing him of his future 
if the fetus is less than  months old it is incapable of feeling pain and will not have to endure pain or suffering during the procedure 
considering that more than  of abortions occur before the fetus is  months old i think the pain that the fetus endures is irrelevant when discussing abortion 
first of all in some cases killing in some cases would be considered wrong due to the amount of pain it causes a point which pro raised 
if you think that murder is wrong because it denies an individuals potential or future then many other things are punishable 
i look forward to pro starting the debate 
the opposition has stated a belief and has used no facts analysis logic or basic reasoning to why you the readers should take on his point of view 
 i brought up the negative impact that unsafe households have on children and here is an article from the daily mail which cites studies which clearly state there is a profound affect on children being in violent families finally a pro adoption page posted an opinion piece about why adoption and abortion are not related and should not be used as alternatives to the other 
i do not advocate for people to always get abortions i only advocate for the ability to consent about what they do once they are in this situation 
the second points purpose was to illustrate the idea that it is moral to have an abortion 
you did directly address my philosophical side of the argument by saying you do not believe in it 
my opponent claims that the first point is meaningless however what point is there to proving that an abortion is moral if i do not prove that there are reasons why people need it to be moral 
in fact peter signer actually mentions these group that fall under his theory and he supports the idea that they are not a person in that state 
the first point gives good reasons to why a potential parent should be given a choice based on the fact that this is a life changing event that some do not want forced onto them 
this is a great question and is the downfall of many people who are pro abortion supporters because they are unsure how to respond to this 
more methods need to be put in place to prevent this situation from occurring at all 
to be fair you did provide to analogies to where the theory would also apply but you did not provide any reasons to why these scenarios disprove the theory 
in stead of replying to that you claimed that i did not cite sources something you seem to believe is quite important 
women are not going out there to get an abortion for the sole purpose to kill a child there is a large decision making process 
i did not mean that individual cases have separate consequences requirements only that the woman involved should be able at any time in the pregnancy to get an abortion with the advisory of a medical professional i only include them here for circumstances where the womans health might be at risk with it still being a morally just thing to do 
a child is a significant investment on behalf of the parents and therefore it is immoral to force women who do not want a child to take on that heavy burden 
if the potential parent feels they are not going to be a good parent for this child then why is it immoral to make sure they are not the parent to this child 
secondly the opposition claim that getting an abortion is bad for the mother because of emotional stress again this is something she will consent to and provides no reason why abortion should not be allowed 
if the parents want to have the child and give it away for adoption that is fine however if the mother thinks she will find it emotionally stressful and would rather an abortion she should be free to do just that 
this argument seeks to define what a human is and once we have a definition it can fuel further discussion over the ethics of abortions 
now of course all these will not apply to all women and of course people who want children take on these things voluntarily but think about someone who does not want to take on these extra challenges or someone who cannot afford it 
now stick with me for this one because it is the most controversial part of this debate and involves philosophy 
if my definition and analysis stands then we can conclude that it is moral to have an abortion as the foetus do not fulfill the requirements to be considered a human 
the opposition wishes to use the fact that abortions because emotional stress to mothers and doctors 
some pre rebuttal in the form as a point is that also the potential parent may not be okay with giving their child away 
having a child is not right for everyone and by taking this option to prioritise the potential parent over the child you can ruin lives of the parents and the the children 
to have dreams and ambitions is seen as something exclusively human and again it cannot be argued that a foetus posses this ability 
my first argument will be centered around the profound affect that a pregnancy can have on a womans life and how this choice needs to be one of the people directly involved and anything other than that is imposing tough consequences on the woman herself and those loved ones 
first i want to establish that i will be focusing on the principle of abortion and thoroughly believe that the time when you can actually get an abortion should be decided by medical professionals and the women involved 
my second argument is philosophical and centered around what makes a human a person 
if no health risk is presented by remaining pregnant and the pregnant woman is not heavily affected by tocophobia then giving the child to family you know that can afford it raise it want it and can be there for it is the better choice but not everybody knows someone like that 
i know several more that constnatly work to provide for their family because of the bad socio economic situation and i even know someone whose mother sold her  year old sister as a prostiute to help provide for the family 
abortion in either case would have been much more beneficial but now those six children need paid for and it will only be a vicious cycle especially since the mother got her daughters back after only  years of them being taken 
i am aware of such things however sometimes it is not feasible and nor is it always the best choice 
now it seems like my opponent is forgetting several points that i have made in my first round which i will point out later in this round first i will refute cons arguments 
a child is not a disease it lives it breathes it has a heartbeat actually for the first three weeks of pregnancy there is no heartbeat they do not breathe until their face hits air which is how water birthing works it will not breathe until the face hits air and for the first several weeks it is no better than any other std 
with all that said my personal experiences should not matter in coming up with a logical view based facts rather than personal history 
he has nowhere to go really and in a town that size there are not a lot of options 
keep in mind i said abortion can sometimes be the right choice not that is all of the time 
my aunt has had  misscaraiges and each one sent her into a state of pure depression 
and while we are talking about health what about a woman who becomes pregnant and during her pregnancy finds out she has aids and so her unborn child does too 
 only if you happen to want a child can afford to care for it and are with someone that can help you to raise the child in the best possible way with no health problems nor outside financial time responsibilities 
 of course even using protection such as the pill and a condom there is a risk of sexually transmitted diseases including pregnancy but as is with adverse effect they for the most part can be treated or else are being researched in how to treat it 
and that can be for many reasons such as having your life threatened the sheer embarrassment the way people think of you having to re live being violated often in front of many people and often more than once for months on end while the trial rages on and many other factors 
 some potential parents would not want to put their children up for adoption for the reasons i listed above 
did you know that there is a clear alignment between children in foster care and adoption and likelihood of depression and suicide 
i understand that this is a very controversial topic and i hope that we can both remain civil and learn from this debate 
which is worse a parent looking into the facts and deciding that the least cruel way to deal with it is to stop it from ever suffering as in killing it before it can feel or forcing someone to go through years of being hurt alone betrayed potentially likely abused before likely killing themselves 
let us say for instance someone is very spirtualistic and they belive that by having an abortion they send that childs soul to a time where it can be better cared for and live a better life than the one that can be provided or that suffering due to the mother having a very bad disease such as aids can be  eliminated by allowing that childs soul to go somewhere else without having to suffer the pain and the illness or the torture of everyday life for that child 
even judaism allows for birth control although they tend to not allow the use of condoms unless someone has an std the primary purpose of sex is to reinforce the loving marital bond between husband and wife 
 plus sex is not made for enjoyment or to help with problems i would like to point out many things right here such as how the body is made for sexual plesure notably the female clitorus and breasts and how many people enjoy anal or oral sex far more than vaginal sex regardless of their sex or orientation which clearly shows that yes it is for pleasure every bit as much as a blueberry muffin is 
the only exception really is cannabis which is for the most part illegal in the united states while sex is legal for everyone over the age of consent in that state 
as for the health aspect it is noted that sex therapy has often been perscibed to people who suffer mental isses such as bi polar or depression as well as stress and for physical injuries as well 
 as far as the points about helping the child later in life or how a short life is better than no life i disagree 
sex is natural child birth is natural but children are by far not the only reason people have sex nor is it why the vast majority of people have it 
while anecondal evidence may give in a factor it must also be presented with facts and statistics such as although i am lactose intolerant and cannot drink milk i understand that for the maority of people it is the way they obtain calcium 
it may not be what you or i believe but it may be true and it may be someone elses belief and so long as it is not actually harming anyone what right do we have to tell them they are wrong 
on the other hand abortion to save mom is also a crucial issue 
the number of rape is huge in america as well as europe and asia 
in that case abortion may be necessary in advanced stage of cancer but if the option of abortion is taken altogether them mother will have no chance at all 
the definition abortion is the act of removing a fetus out of womb 
if the fetus is considered a living being then it is a killing of life 
case b when it saves life abortion saves life in the following cases rape molestation critical medical condition when mothers life can be saved by removing fetus 
so you agree that in the case when abortion can save moms life it should be allowed 
you have a boyfriend and out of passion on someday you two made out 
let us suppose that you are a girl like any other fun loving girl 
you and your lover have no source of income 
worse none of your family does not accept this relationship 
well hello everyone i believe that abortion is right because what if a women gets raped god for bid or purely gets pregnant and does not want the baby 
abortion is completely fine when you have the abortion the baby practically is not even alive so who cares also its the mums choice is it not and it is extremely scary and painful to have a bay personally if i got pregnant i would have the baby 
if you are conservative against gun control and if you are also against abortion because we need to protect the innocent 
if a woman is raped and gets pregnant she should not have to bear that child as a constant reminder of that tragedy 
yes but if the parents do not tell them early it could be mentally scaring also if they do not get adopted they will go into the foster system or an orphanage not sure which of those two is worth 
it is murder is the killing taking of ones life another person or life form taking of ones life implies that the person must be alive 
i will start by debunking the most common arguments against abortion reason rebutted  
if so why are you against gun control  or more of gun death in america are innocent children 
it is unconstitutional because of life liberty and the pursuit happiness the other ones liberty and the pursuit of happiness say that a person may do whatever they choose in the pursuit of happiness 
but at the same time abortion can be good depending on the reason 
i will be arguing against the resolution abortion is wrong 
he does not refute any of my points so we must conclude that he concedes all of them 
what i meant was that if a child is not going to make it long enough to even experiance any sort of life if they are just going to be so seriously disabled and so seriouisly handicapped that they are completely unaware that there is a life to be lived 
so i reply if there is a minor chance that things will go wrong then i understand why people would opt for the chance to live but for me if a child was to be born and the chances were greater than  of him her not surviving the first week of it is life then its more or less going to happen can you tell me that doctors predictions are mostly wrong 
at what point do you feel life begins only when you have asked yourself that can you decide whether abortion before this point is murder or not 
 the whole victim of childhood sexul abuse was misunderstood p i mean that a grown up woman was not ready to have a child as she had been sexually abused and she is emotionally unstable due to her horrific past 
it apllies to any situation he has to deal with not just the death of the mother this bit confused me because i was refering to the matyr as the mother who was giving up her life for the babies 
and one last thing does this mean to say that if you have explored every single possibility and every single angle of the problem issue and you have decided for abortion that is acceptable because you have followed what you said 
and the rape thing how could a woman be expected to go through  months of emotional turmoil constantly reminded of her terrifying and horrifying ordeal that she was victimised and unvoluntarly impregnated by a man whom she does not love 
the child may grow up guilty ashamed and unwanted as their father was a rapist and their mother a victimised weakling 
i know bad things happen and i know people live through them i know people get I will and recover but what are the chances of a day old baby pulling through brain damage or something 
you also said if that is the case then why not just kill everyone out on the streets who is living a healthy life 
but there is the chance of it going possitively as well 
and I am not saying that any loving and caring mother out there would not die for their children but here maybe the fetus is only  weeks old can this technically be called a baby 
i am not saying that the disabled and handicapped cannot live a life but serious cases whereby the child would not have any sort of fulfilled life then i feel it is more human to let that child rest before any pain is felt at all 
i am not saying that we can predict the future but i also think that if a child is going to seriously suffer in life because of uncontroble things then it is less cruel to terminate it 
what i mean is if the child is going to be born and live for a week because its got this illness which is not curable is not it more cruel to make it live for that week of pain rather than having to go through the obvious emotional distress of an abortion 
yes i adoption is a choice and I am not saying that adopted children are not happy but there is always going to be something missing in their life some questions that cannot be answered like which could eat a child inside out 
another round gone vote for the one still participating please ladies and gentlemen 
my opponent forfeited this round if you are planning on voting you know what to do 
it is true that if someone kills a woman intending to have a child then it is counted as a double homicide or in your description vehicular manslaughter 
there are some religions that claim a soul enters the embryo at conception a claim of which is unprovable and untestable 
i give the floor back to pro who will now bring new arguments to defend his point and may counter my arguments as well 
that means even if my heart lungs and liver could each save one person no one could touch my body 
killing the unborn child of a woman who had every intention of giving birth is considered murder because of the autonomous rights of the mother 
if we are going to use the law to influence our decisions i suppose i d claim that this supreme court case will trump any other law that might be used to counter my arguments 
up until a few decades ago women didn t have the right to vote or serve in the military 
i will consider this my accepting statement and give pro the floor to make his case as to why abortion is wrong 
minister ruled out a ban on amniocentesis saying that it was for the people to change their attitude to female children 
rising demand for sex work and trafficking networks since the presence of a woman will improve the status of a household she will become an asset which will be protected even more than now by the family 
 female infanticide this does not help your case in any way i strongly disagree 
first of all let us look at the reasons that forced the government to illegalize ssa this statement is misleading because the following paragraph illustrated the circumstances in which the law was passed as opposed to a reason 
 proper care at the same time a far more common method is simply neglecting a girl child a passive strategy intended to deprive girls of fair access to and share of household resources with reduced survival probability as a consequence 
since women from the weakest classes will essentially be marrying into a higher class a married woman would gain an improved access to resources 
the divide between rich and poor would increase can you explain this 
 a newborn female then has better mating prospects than a newborn male and therefore can expect to have more offspring 
i will repost the remaining in my  round if i have space 
the women opting for ssa are not responsible for these crimes 
any law which legalizes ssa must take care to ensure that there is explicit consent of the woman 
islam allowed men to have up to  wives this was the direct consequence of wars which resulted in large decreases in male population 
there will probably result in a greater crime rates for the crimes prostitution rackets kidnapping sexual violence which you mentioned 
you are unfairly placing the burden on the couples that have a child of a specific gender 
my opponent s source further bolsters my point in addition there is a risk that stronger enforcement of the ban on sex determination and sex selective abortions would risk endangering access to reproductive health services potentially driving abortion users underground 
if women want to make a correction they can make this correction by actively discriminating during marriage against those communities the states of punjab and haryana have the worst sex ratios which are practicing female foeticide infanticide 
also those men who are likely to commit acts of gender based violence would simply become extinct their acts of violence would result from their inability to find a mate 
 therefore parents genetically disposed to produce females tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them 
wars result in a decrease in the male population 
let us look at the effects of an imbalanced sex ratio  reduction in poverty the government has illegalized ssa because it anticipates a skewed sex ratio 
if ssa is legalized couples will have no reason to discriminate on the basis of gender the girl child will be more likely to receive proper attention 
there will be a change in culture i anticipate an improvement in the status of women 
 the government of india anticipating a catastrophe in the form of severe imbalance in the male female ratio has passed an act to prevent sex selective abortion 
let us look at some of the reasons for legalizing sex selective abortion  safeguarding the health of women even though it is illegal sex selective abortion is still widely practiced 
 ethical perspective if a couple feels that its evolutionary interests can best be handled by a specific gender they have a right to choose which gender they want to raise irrespective of the scientific logical validity of their decision 
this is because the couple will be investing significant resources in the upbringing of their child time money etc 
the non christians may also respond but please be respectful of other comments if you are father got you pregnant would any if the women out the get an abortion 
abortion promotes a culture in witch human life is disposable  
the original hippocratic oath traditionally taken by doctors when swearing to practice medicine ethically forbids abortions  
women should not use abortion as a form of contraception 
while you are reading this a child is dying because of an adults ignorance 
 of all abortions occurs between   weeks gestation 
nathans an early proponent became a pro life campaigner after he saw a  week old fetus scream during an abortion 
abortion is a sad cruel way to end a babys life 
i feel like abortion is the most horrific way to hurt a child 
i feel like abortion is the most horrific way to hurt a child 
 now i am sure that not to many people are actually aware of the population crises in america or the world for that matter but in spite of the small amounts of media and news coverage the threat is very real 
contention  overpopulation i will start out my last contention with a quote by christ hedges who is a former correspondent and author of the article 
population projections year projected population percent changefrom population                           now immagine an overpopulated disaster in the you s imagine lands that once could be enjoyed for their natural beauty are now concrete jungles our countrys children attend schools that are overloaded and lack the teacher to student interaction we once had social infrastructures and systems are overloaded natural resources are being depleted and our environment is being tasked beyond its limits 
rebutteli will refute my opponents case in the form of four objectections to key problems that my opponent has made and show why these problems hold no water 
now my opponent is more then likely state that a fetus is a human and therefore has the right to life and i would agree with him 
this omission is odd given that a doubling in population even if we cut back on the use of fossil fuels shut down all our coal burning power plants and build seas of wind turbines will plunge us into an age of extinction and desolation unseen since the end of the mesozoic era  million years ago when the dinosaurs disappeared 
so since a fetus is not a person then it has no serious right to life 
abortion the termination of a pregnancy after accompanied by resulting in or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus 
 by  if we continue to reproduce at the current rate the planet will have between  billion and  billion people 
to deny it would be to deny your selves and neither i or my opponent would be in this debate because we would most likely be doing whatever our government told us to do 
books and documentaries that deal with the climate crisis including al gores fail to discuss the danger of population growth 
the you s has nearly quadrupled the number of people within its boundaries in the past century if our population multiplies by that same amount within the coming century we will hold over one billion people 
he sited bible verses and the christian religion as justification for making abortion illegal which is insuffiient because since it is unconstitutional because it violates seperation of church and state 
while in as much as  countries abortion is legalized remaining countries have partial restrictions or complete ban on abortion unless life of the mother is at stake 
adoption is not an alternative to abortion because it remains the womans choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption 
yet the american psychological association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion and that there was no evidence of post abortion syndrome 
as it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord its health is dependent on her health and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb 
 risk of serious complications and do not affect a womans health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth 
in the case of rape or incest forcing a woman made pregnant by this violent act would because further psychological harm to the victim 
in the us itself more than  cases of abortion are reported on daily basis 
others can t precisely gauge or understand the level of trauma that a woman may be experiencing in her personal life 
you would be surprised to know that abortion caused due to rape and other health complications account to nearly  while the remaining cases of abortion are primarily a result of personal and social issues 
in fact abortion has always been a heated subject amongst the masses as people have their own school of thoughts regarding it 
abortion pros sometimes life can be really harsh on us 
statistics show that very few women who give birth choose to give up their babies less than  of white unmarried women and less than  of black unmarried women 
she is the only person who knows best if she would be able to take care of the unplanned child or not 
sometimes they are prepared to be a mother then a complication arises after they have purposely become pregnant and they are forced to either kill the child or possibly die with it at birth 
the parents could be unready for a child because of financial or personal reasons so it should be legal even though it is still very wrong 
well you could forfeit or make a stance i suppose 
there is nothing to debate 
now having it after the  trimester is bad due to the fact it not only purges a human life it also leaves not only physical scaring but emotional scaring as well for the woman 
i believe abortion should not be illegal for the simple fact that her body is hers alone no one can tell her to or not to have an abortion 
if a female choses to have an abortion it is her right as a female 
if they have an unplanned pregnancy it makes sense to be able to abort the baby so you do not have to go through the pregnancy at all 
you can even say that the yet to be born baby is not alive as it would not be able to live without being in its mothers womb and an abortion will not be performed if the baby is past a certain stage of development 
i think elective abortion is a right to women i am a man as women have the right to their own bodies 
having an abortion will reduce the stress on families who can not afford a baby 
if a woman will die because of the birth of a baby then abortion is a reasonable choice 
 because of those  reasons you should  
i only hope she says something in the next round  
 where did you get this information con 
it looks like con is refusing to debate the majority of my argument which makes me quite sad but being a good sport i will be more then happy to debate her arguments against abortion 
second a fetus is not a child and third if abortions were the reason men went around impregnating women then why do all the ones paying child support to  different children continue to put woman in that same situation 
 let us begin by looking at cons quote from mother teresa which says by abortion the mother does not learn to love but kills her own child to solve her problems 
 it can not be murder because you can not kill what has not even been born 
but was it was not something for which men and women give up their liberties for 
am i to understand that the sentient life of others is worth more than our own personal liberties 
 patrick henry to the virginia house of burgesses is there a value to sentient life 
but to be frank i do not care how sentient the fetus is 
if the british came tomorrow to our shores to chain our women are we to sit idly with our thumbs twiddling because the british are sentient lives 
 at the beginning of the debate i raised the issue of personal liberty 
i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death 
and third women will not have to undergo the unbearably painful experience of child birth until they are ready 
 i am not necessarily saying that third trimester abortions would be either good or bad in regards to the economy personal liberties or the quality of life 
is it good national policy for force all females to serve as hosts to these sentient parasites 
imagine if the government decided that you only need half of that to survive and so takes that pay check away from you and then spends it on food to feed people in darfur 
 so to repeat argument  third trimester abortions are good for the economy personal liberties and quality of life 
 let approach this debate from another angle 
since sentient life is more important than the quality of life we should have just let black people keep slaving away at the plantations as long as their slave masters only beat them and not kill them 
if our government wanted to protect life then it should ban the use of automobiles 
choice  argue that good national policy should only take into consideration the sanctity of human life oh and i am sooooo ready for this choice  even though it is a bad policy we should implement it anyway to make religious people happy which in my opinion would be a fantastic and creative rebuttal albeit a difficult course to navigate choice  forfeit the next however many rounds 
and third women will not have to undergo the unbearably painful experience of child birth until they are ready 
so what tens of thousands of people die in automobile crashes 
but if i told everyone we should ban automobiles to preserve the lives of innocent pedestrians you would call me insane 
i heard you wrong 
i am forfeiting my debate because i realize i was wrong 
my job as creator of this debate is to prove that prochoice is proabortion 
your lack of a response does not display that you are committed to this debate 
this is due to a variety of reasons  we do not know the reason for a womans choice  the illegal nature of abortions endangers women  there are better ways to reduce the amount of abortions in society i do not believe that government should have any say in a womans choice 
i believe that every human life should have the chance to become a beautiful human being and if my girlfriend was ever impregnated i would do everything in my power to preserve the life of my child 
this way our society can lessen the amounts of abortion without putting the lives and bodies of women at risk and making them criminals 
by making it illegal women would be forced to go to unregulated and shady doctors for the procedure 
that being said i still respect others choice to get an abortion 
the first round if for accepting the challenge the next two rounds will be for providing your own arguments supporting them and refuting the other arguments 
i adamantly believe in the pro choice ethos 
yours sincerely bem  
i will challenge you in this debate 
i am pro choice and i am excited to hear your opinion 
now i agree that some abortions are not handled correctly but that does not mean we should take that option away from women altogether 
i believe a  year old should have the right to get an abortion but with an id 
and i want to know why the fetus would be considered a living breathing full human being and no different from a baby or child or even adult 
if you listen to these people and know their ideology you would know they are against them 
it is not like the women wants to have an abortion either 
i know it will end up being a child but if you take away someones brain they die so i do not know if a fetus is a human being when it does not have a brain 
it is a tough choice she has to make and there is definitely no joy involved when it happens 
i also agree that anti abortionists do not necessarily hate women 
there should not be any abortions after this point about   weeks in 
so let us say no abortions after  weeks like the definition says 
i think that kind of answered all three questions 
I am not as much against the people who just think abortion should be illegal as i am against these 
my opponents final argument is completely irrelevant 
of course my opponent would never make these arguments as they are against his conservative ideals which are what dictates his opposition to abortion rather than a genuine concern for life 
if this were an argument about the government funding the deaths of children my opponent would also have to argue why death by abortion is worse than death by unmanned aerial vehicle 
he would also have to argue why the government does not fund medical care of all children in the united states once they are born 
with these two points clarified i think it is justified to say that even though i am pro the burden of proof is on my opponent to prove that  the federal government provides significant funding of non medical non abuse abortions through tax payer dollars and  the amount of federal dollars used to fund non medical non abuse abortions is not justified 
availability of these options vary from year to year but for the sake of semantics the hyde amendment bans federal funding of non medical abortions non rape incest abortions 
the hyde amendment which is voted on every year currently allows for federal funding of abortions in cases of rape incest or if the mothers life is endangered by the pregnancy 
number  was a good point that is definitely brutal to me and as i said i would not want to have anyone i know ever do this because as i do believe it is a terrible thing to do it should still be someones choice to do that and because it is not ruled as homicide until the fetus is born then although this pains me to say the woman still does have the right to do that 
i will take for an example that i saw on this website someone wrote that i am holding a baby and a fetus you need to choose one of them to drop the one that you choose will die if it is dropped the drop symbolizes killing one of them 
i will also continue to do research also what do you think of trumps wall do you agree if you do then i could create another debate if not i will think of something else 
it can not survive for a day without being inside of the women so this should still be considered her body and should be viewed as a womans choice on what to do with there own body 
all the rights a fetus has goes to the mother because in the constitution the  amendment says that something is alive when it is born until then the fetus is part of the womans body 
until the fetus is born it is not considered alive by the us constitution 
the one circumstance in which i think abortion is morally justified is in cases where the pregnancy puts the mothers life at risk 
second it is justified because if a pregnant woman dies then so does her unborn and it is better to save one life than to lose two 
but those do not exhaust the circumstances under which a person might get an abortion therefore they do not show that abortion 
even if it was a fact that abortion is murder the government is not allowed to pass a law which contradicts the consensus or even in some cases the near majority 
in other words you have not yet attacked my conclusion nor my premises 
when roe v wade passed in  a year after the above mentioned statistic deaths from abortion drastically dropped 
this is supported by the national center for health statistics own statistics 
  the declaration of human rights and not the declaration of peoples rights 
given these criteria it logically follows that a human fetus cannot possess the same right to life that a grown adult has since it does not qualify as a person 
since a fetus does not possess any of the above qualities it can rightfully not be considered a person 
my reasons as to why it is not murder a fetus a fetus is not a rational or conscious agent and therefore does not hold a serious right to life 
thank you for the debate and may i ask you to be more clear for example are we talking about legalization of abortion or is abortion excusable this would be much appreciated 
the parent is imprisoned and the child starves to death wow great solution instead of one person suffering now that is assuming abortion is murder we have two 
there are many cases and many instances where a child can ruin ones life or even the whole families life 
sources were provided and did you honestly think that abortion would stop if it were illegal 
because I have never had the opportunity of being a pregnant lady nor do i have the privilege of remembering my fetus days i do not consider myself fit to actually judge as to whether abortion is ok or not 
in other words i will be debating that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient while con will do something along the lines that the morality of abortion should be determined by deciding whether a fetus is a person or not 
this is not your typical abortion debate 
the fact that this planet has continued to sustain us humans as long as we have existed in our diabolical number is a miracle in itself far greater than moses splitting the red sea or jesus turning bread to flesh and water to wine 
and it is also very true that many people who do not follow a faith also are strongly against abortion and i would just like to point out that neither do i find it a pleasing nor happy concept that abortion is legal but i do strongly wholeheartedly understand that it is a completely necessary process just as was world war i and ii horrific dreadful but necessary to protect the world as we know it 
simple abortion is a cruel and cold way of helping this planet but it is a way we must not forget that while we sit comfortably at our warm homes drinking cold beer while typing away on our laptops me anyway that millions people women men and children could benefit from abortion 
agreed abortion is but one of the ways to curb the overpopulation of the planet but it is still a way a way that that would help millions of impoverished women to ease the strain on themselves and their families already beset by poverty and in many cases starvation 
by having a further child they are putting further strain on their family and in many cases the new born child will not live to adulthood 
again forgive my terrible analogy but we humans are like an infestation of rats on this beautiful planet except in our case there is no exterminator 
hard as it may seem to accept this is a case where the unborn unconscious child has to be murdered so to help the survival of his born conscious living breathing siblings who would otherwise would be murdered through war starvation and disease 
thanks for reading this far 
the comic would be more accurate if in your comic god had said i stick with my previous argument 
thereby it is essentially as dictated by a free tolerant society legal to have abortions by those medical practitioners who agree to perform them 
 i certainly am aware people have their own personal ideas but i am using a defined and nationally agreed upon definition cited earlier in article  of the united nations universal declaration of human rights i believe i explained why it is good for society and individuals maintaining women s human rights which i briefly elaborated on i also believe it accomplishes all that i have reasoned in my arguments 
 of the approximately  million abortions are performed by unskilled individuals in environments that do not meet minimum medical standards or both and unsafe abortion is the because of   maternal deaths each year plus many other health complication 
 perhaps you hold some view that you are not responsible for not acting and or believe there is some arbiter to natural circumstances for death 
 group sustainability does not only mean earth s population it can be in respect to her individual circumstances for sustainability as the possible child makes her a group of two whether by herself among a group of  or a larger group of a few thousand people and more 
i hope you are not attempting to mask suffering in some ambiguous notions so to equate the suffering of a fetus or unborn child to a born child whose suffering will be greater because their capacity to realizing this burden on themselves and those in his her life 
you are suggesting that we increase the number of orphans by possibly another  million a year 
 this certainly is not true perhaps you have little concept of exponential population growth or the fact that all over the world people are dying from starvation dehydration bad hygiene a lack of basic human rights 
the choice to abort or not to abort will have consequences you are not getting out of this either way you will be contributing to the death of a possible life 
though there was slight drop in recent years in the us let us not forget around the world there are an estimated  million orphans your only adoption is not in proportion with reality which i think is a common problem with a number of your responses 
sustainability has been the number one reason for most of human existence though i might add for most of that time the process of abortion was not understood and instead infanticide was the typical course taken 
your use of the terms unborn baby and killing must arouse certain emotions in you so as to distract you from the further consequences of your lack of action to prevent unneeded suffering and the emotional physical damages caused by those state of events 
 yes or no conclusion abortion is favored conclusion is elaborated on to reduce the amount of suffering and needless death of those brought into the world only to suffer and die should constitute a good thing for it adds to the well being of the people capable of continuing existence 
also included are the lack of professional support with access to accurate and up to date information about all the things involved in abortion i e history modern understanding of the process physiological analysis physical exams before and after the procedure 
those rights include first this persons right to control their bodily functions in such a way that they can be considered to have aspirations to full participation equal membership and active involvement in society 
to start my argument i would like to invoke what i will argue are important factors in deciding whether abortion is acceptable on the terms i agreed to above 
thus we can conclude that it is always in our best interest to keep open options for the populations control in order to balance our sustainability 
if no safe access to abortion is available the means to accomplish the abortion are dangerous and lead to unsafe choices 
i would like to add the form of payment as it will be under the table and lacking any records of responsibility 
a population can only sustain a certain amount of people based on the groups ability to also sustain to food water resources and space for the individuals to live 
i will not assert or continue any debate about what one personally should feel about the act of abortion in and of itself 
here an argument is made that the results of not acting to provide safe access to abortion only increases the harm done 
conclusion abortion is favored conclusion is elaborated on it can be further demonstrated by historical standards of human relations that because of the person who bares the child they without abortion options are forced to be dependent on others for well being with but few exceptions 
by the words of charlotte perkins gilman not only these but home and happiness reputation ease and pleasure her bread and butter all must come to her through a small gold ring 
even worse is when abortion is railed against by those whom proclaim they are fighting for a possible life they themselves are not willing to take care of and will soon as possible turn a blind eye to the forthcoming real suffering of lives effected by 
final statementi think i have made some solid arguments in favor of abortion and responded to my opponent with respect a willingness to review learn and argue accordingly based on what could be established and or reasonably argued 
in total i made  contentions  importance of group  human  societal and individual  reduction in criminal  access to abortion reduces infantacide a human rights violationsplease take time to review each of my contention from the beginning and attempt to follow them through the rounds and i hope those who read the debate enjoyed it and also find my arguments more convincing 
mandatory waiting periods and parental consent laws by making unprotected sex acknowledged problem to avoid may have effects that reduce risky sexual behavior of teens which can continue into adulthood 
having it strongly implement in social and sex education programs could possibly reduce the reasons given for an unintended pregnancy thus a possible reduction is the number of potential abortions  felt they could not get pregnant at the time of conception 
 by reducing some of the reasons women give for having an abortion will in turn reduce some of the abortion that might have otherwise taken place 
available safe access to highly regulated abortion programs with evaluations and up to date educational programs can even reduce abortions 
conclusion abortion is favoredconclusion elaborated on people will commit infanticide for a number of reasons including but not limited to their ability care for the child want of the child or forced participation with group etc human rights are granted to a person upon birth according to international law therefore once a child is born and infanticide is committed this is a violation of that child s human rights 
well yes it is because your ending it is life but you are responsible for that life and if you can not support that child or you are to immature then most likely you do not want that responsibility because its a big one 
life and death a large part of our debate has been on how mean life or death is so i want to go into it a bit more 
adoption now although that was a lovely example of the benefits of adoption like anything that is not always the case adoption can be hard how would you like to find out that these are not your real parents and that your own abandoned you 
as an example i used to have someone in my school who had a stammer of course its a minor problem which normally can be overcome with support but unfortunately for him everyone bullied him and it got to the stage when i said hello to him and he told me to f off now i know this is just one school but he became very antisocial to people who were trying to be nice to him 
as for it being a excuse for murder it is a double edged blade whilst killing the child is wrong and unjust and letting the child be born and its life is that of poverty and neglect 
clarification and development i agree in that the parents do not matter in the sense that they should not get to decide if they want a child but we have to make sure the child life is going to be one where it can prosper and develop because if the parents do not care for their child then it could lead to a life of abuse neglect etc 
a teen should not have to raise a baby if they are not ready 
i see where you are coming from but the fetus does not feel pain until  weeks if it is past  weeks then i agree with you but before  weeks is fine 
who would care for a disfigured baby due to incest 
vote samyul thanks everyone for reading the rather short debate we can all agree that these are not the type of debates we all look to read but unfortunately they happen 
my arguments and thoughts remain as presented above 
but it is irrelevant in this debate i just thought id throw that information in to this debate to prevent my opponent from using an logical fallacy technique against me 
now my opponent has not really given me much to debate on so i will try and infer what my opponent is trying to portray and points that they are trying to convey and then debate off of those 
it is impossible to for sure say when human life begins that is a religious question and the beginning of human life cannot be proven 
well believe it or not your opinion is not the only opinion and just because you think something is wrong does not mean that it should be outlawed 
 i am not doubting certain statements rather i am emphasizing the point that my opponent provided no source to validate his statements 
i may think that sport cars should be outlawed because they are dangerous and i do not like them 
 now one may reply saying that to end a pregnancy you must a humans life 
just like an acorn has the potential to become an oak tree 
 once again you have never proven it was a person or even a child 
 animals are living things and people eat them 
but you have not proven the unborn to be children yet 
you have not even touched this aspect of my argument 
it is forming into something so precious that god has given you i never denied it was life 
what i did deny was whether the unborn are people 
they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own 
but then you must also argue other natural things such as disease must be allowed to run their course without treatment disease is natural and if by having sex you are consenting to pregnancy why would not touching a toilet seat be consenting to whatever disease may be present on the toilet seat 
an acorn is never defined as an oak tree so why should a clump of cells be defined as a person 
c it is wrong to kill unborn innocent babies the conclusion does not follow because it relies upon the first two premises 
if you have sex you must accept responsibility i know ask the question why is sexual intercourse a contract for pregnancy 
for example if i drive a car on a rainy day does this mean i consent to a car accident which can because harm to me and possibly kill me 
since there was no consent for the creation of the human the human is akin to being the product of rape 
life is dangerous and almost anything we do has the potential for danger man acknowledges this but man does not consent to danger 
why is it that in no other circumstance other than abortion do people argue taking the risk equals consent for the damages and the waiving of the right to mitigate these damages 
if you argue against this then your premise regarding abortion is misogynist and only seeks to unequally render the health and bodily integrity of those who can get pregnant meaningless and not the population as a whole 
pregnancy is a contract keep in mind they imply many of these claims  
to further my point simply acknowledging a risk does not mean implicit consent for the risk 
my opponent takes the bop in an attempt to fulfill it presents three main arguments which i will show below  
stop being such a soft weak censored individual and accept death as not only a natural part of life but a necessity in this day and age 
life is a series of decisions choices we make all the time every minute of everyday this is only one small decision 
either way it does not matter to me what you want to call it i call it making a decision 
friends and sources are telling me you can not be murdered until you receive a birth certificate have been born into this world and declared a human being 
first of all yes i condone murder when it is justified i agree with the death penalty and abortion and suicide 
if you do a little research you will see that far more people are being born into this world then leaving it especially since the life expectancy of humans has doubles in the past few hundred years people are living way too long hence the resulting overpopulation 
logical thinking and realistic planning like allowing more people to die might just prolong the death of this planet for a little while longer if not then at least it will save me from getting robbed in ten years by those starving broke kids you thought had a right to live even though their moms welfare check can not feed them enough after her new wardrobe and hairstyle 
i will allow him one more chance to rebut 
these are the only arguments my opponent has advance so now i guess i will wait for him to respond and expand 
since you are apparently arguing the moral and not legal perspective i will attempt to rebut by showing that the choice of a woman to have an abortion is moral and even just 
sir do you have a life 
to start abortion are good for young women in there teen years who are dirty birdies and are not using birth control or condoms 
i mean if the mother wants the abortion then it shall happen i mean its not forced but i do not think that it should be banned 
if my opponent had her way children would be forced to carry a child and put themselves and the baby at risk 
my opponent was disrespectful throughout this debate not just to me but to commentators as well 
i have debated my point and i thank you for your time 
if abortion were to be legal just under life threatening circumstances which is your case then it would be the law saving her life 
sexual assault the forcible perpetration of an act of sexual contact on the body of another person male or female without his or her consent 
low birth weight babies are more likely to have organs that are not fully developed which can result in complications such as bleeding in the brain respiratory distress syndrome and intestinal problems 
according to the american medical association babies born to women who do not have regular prenatal care are  times more likely to die before the age of  year 
 my first point discusses some ideas on when life begins but the heart starts to beat  days from conception and by  days the heart is pumping blood through a closed circulatory system 
nutrition they have a higher rate of poor eating habits than older women and are less likely to take recommended daily vitamins to maintain adequate nutrition during pregnancy 
what I am saying is not that science has proved when life begins but it has proved some basic guidelines for an idea of it 
adolescent mothers are about  years behind in their age group for completing their education 
assault  adolescent pregnancies have many risk factors for their babies 
gastrulation commences at the beginning of the third week of pregnancy when the zygote now known as an embryo is implanted into the uterus of the mother 
it is from this point and onward during development that the fetus is capable of the type of mental activity associated with humanity 
the younger a mother is below age  the greater the risk of her infant dying during the first year of life and infants born to teens are   times more likely to have low birth weight than those born to mothers age  or older 
if you have an abortion at the right time no harm will come to you or the fetus 
according to rainn org there are   victims of sexual assault each year and  of them are under the age of  
if abortion were illegal the doctors could not just request the government let them slide by the law to save this womans life 
how your stomach got bigger and bigger how you vomited in the mornings constantly how your feet got swollen and let us not forget the excruciating pain of labor 
first and foremost can your body even handle a pregnancy at that age 
even if a teen could later put the baby up for adoption the baby would have already been exposed to dangerous conditions 
until then there are just cells not a baby or even a fetus 
if you are in an abusive relationship and in no position to be bringing a life into this world you have still having that baby 
if a little girl is raped she is having that baby 
being against abortion means that you think it should be completely illegal no matter what situation you may be put into 
these innocent female teens are forced to pay the child support along with school bills and college money 
again the woman would find a way to have her baby terminated which would be more painful than the legal process already is 
while my views differ from yours i would like to address that yes abortion is wrong in a sense but it should be a choice as I have defended and will finish off in this last post but before i do so i will go over a few points that we have agreed and most would agreed on 
if we are going to impose such laws then i do not see why stop there go full frontal with masturbation laws 
it would also do more harm for the babies and because more pain to them as if they do not have enough pain enough through the scary abortion processes 
the slavery period was in a completely different time but i guess that is the more valid comparison you made out of these two 
women should not be modern day slaves and have to carry such burdens 
it would seem to me most pro lifers are selfish and have to have it their way like burger king or something 
as for handicaps and such not having personhood and everything they are already out of the womb and are special cases 
c not a win situation for the mother regardless of what decision she makes 
again once the baby is out of the womb and enters the world people stop caring and no longer give a damn 
i do not even think the infants themselves have brains yet I am unsure but there is certain restrictions on if it is too late to get abortions and i think they do them before the brain form so correct me if I am wrong 
people can argue all they want about bettering the mother or the baby but what it comes down to is that abortion is the murdering an unborn fetus 
so I am going to make a few rebuttals against your post here and maybe add a few others things 
again I am not saying every baby is going to come out a bad apple or a genetic freak with diseases but i would again say the chances are not good in those type of cases 
abortion again is currently a free choice and as for it being morally wrong sometimes it is the right thing to do like taken a terminally I will family member off life support 
now to go back to the female she should not have to be restricted and carry the burden regardless of her choice and be forced to carry an unwanted baby 
i would say in that case you would be setting the baby free into the kingdom of heaven not arguing this but this is just food for thought in looking at it from a pro choice religious aspect and this is irrelevant beside the part that most pro life people are believers of god but since the debate has not gone to this topic and would be too late now I am going to rebuttal your points from your post and address the questions that you asked 
even then if we are going to do a study on this from all abortion cases the rape ones might be the ones in first place compared to the others so it is worth looking centering around for this debate 
as a law abiding citizen of the us and the state you reside you have the legal rights to have an abortion even if those are against it and it would seem to me that most would be understanding of rape cases 
again i agree it is stupid for mothers who get unexpectedly pregnant and discard the baby like trash after but it is a choice it is the law and the mother has that right 
now it would be better to string up a poll on but heres the thing although that would be a better agreeable ground for most and resolve the issues the thing is you can almost never know if someone is telling the truth about rape or lying therefore abortions sadly have to be open to all those who want to have one 
i feel that i addressed the other cases of abortion that does not deal with rape victims well it is something they can control for the most part sure a rubber can break but the chances of getting pregnant from safe sex are very low compared to unsafe sex 
yes it is often said that one does bury their own grave and this is true just for about most choices in life but one that should stand at from this is whole ordeal is that there is no clear win situation for the mother 
now as for the occasional mothers who willingly want babies and decide to abort or mothers who have unprotected sex and get preggo and need to abortion then well that is a different matter but again it is a choice and needs to stay that way even if it is stupid 
also did i mention most of these children end up being on the wrong side of the law 
why should a female who is been raped at let us say age  or age  any age rather have to carry the burden of having a unwanted baby from a total stranger 
well regardless if the fetus is a human at any rate abortion should be considered and be choice 
i find it injustice more so on the female who is been raped if she were not allowed an abortion 
i think every women has the right to chose what they want to do with their body 
i believe that is all i have to say i would say that it was a pleasure debating with you but the fact that you continuously kept clinging onto the part about life even when there are people out there dying in war dying from murder dying from fire accidents dying from medical causes well i hope you get the jist 
there is no correct answer where human life begins it is mainly just a blurry line of what people claim 
even some children with such supportment including a family that wants them and a house would not be able to get that far 
women do not have a to have children and certainly don t assume such a responsibility by virtue of deciding to have sex 
adoption still requires women to carry a baby to term and then give birth both of which are also inherently dangerous 
this as the argument says clearly shows that human life begins at conception 
interesting and quick fact most people reject the position that abortion is always wrong 
one of the most common arguments today against being pro choice is the fact that there is a strand of dna in each cell of an embryo 
bearing a child alters a womans life more than anything else 
many people believe that bringing an unwanted child into the world is a crime and that forcing a woman to have a child against her will is morally wrong 
so from your statement there for taking the loss and to move on are implying that having a child is a loss 
many who are opposed to abortion for religious or moral reasons believe that it is wrong to impose their values by civil law on everyone 
also to answer your question i believe that the woman has the choice to decide whether to undergo abortion within the first  months 
are you really denying the woman a choice of what happens to her own body 
i believe what you fail to comprehend is while you continue on to praise about life and ect humans are not the only life on earth 
truth be told what if the parents of the child was actually having protected sex but with the only problem being that the protection let say was broken or so 
so until a day where all war stops that is when i believe you would have the right to say that we should stop abortion mean whilst i doubt you have the right to continue on praising life 
so let me ask you do you really want a child to be raised up by parents that are not even there 
if women are not allowed to abort an unwanted foetus they are deprived of this right 
with that statement it is still abortion and you even claimed that 
the average iq of the people in america is   i would say that i clearly doubt they would even make such a decision 
moving on what you have claimed about i would like to state that if you are able to conduct what you wish if you have everything that is needed then i am unsure what is stopping you from doing so 
are you actually implying that the human race would be ever so 
the irony is I will probably lose this debate due to vote bombing 
but above all the fundamental reason sribs expresses his opinion this way in his opening argument is because he wants to inflict her morals upon the different people around her 
what i believe my opponent was trying to say though was that the forced termination of human life is 
he maintains that because killing is therefore abortion is also wrong 
in other words if at any time in your life you were not procreating you just destroyed potential life 
who are we to expect pregnant women to voluntarily donate their body and life support systems to something else 
but even if a fetus were a human being its still would not trump the rights of the mother 
if we can assume that preventing life to become life is in fact killing then every moment you are not engaging in the act of reproduction you are killing potential life 
look i understand your concern and it was nice being pressured about this kind of topic noting we only had five minutes per round anyways pro choice thank you for the debate 
first off i would like to thank my opponent for challenging me in this debate topic 
 dolores o riordan to start this one off I will mention that while dolores is not judging women that plan to have or have had an abortion she is very biased and maybe uneducated in her argument 
instead the quote delves into the microscopic level of reality my words not what was actually meant to be implied in dr seuss book horton hears a who 
this should stay true until that living thing effects another living in a negative way like how a girl of your age would not be prepared alone to bear a child 
even though some women say oh i do not mind to have one every time a woman has an abortion it just crushes her self esteem smaller and smaller and smaller 
i try to make everything i say as clear and unbiased as i can please tell me if you find something unclear opinionated in my writing 
what baffles me is the lack of understanding that one life is not the most important issue 
but even then it does not matter that a person is a person no matter how small 
abortion is entirely a womens choice which is one of the reasons why people around the world fight for the right to get an abortion to have a choice between having a child or not 
this basically meaning that what she says about other women what they feel how they must feel after getting an abortion is not necessarily true 
what dolores says about abortions not being healthy is false and the statement seems to be fabricated from her own assumptions judging by her wording 
a zygote is not sentient nor is it coherent and it is so dependent and connected it is for lack of better words carrier that it responds to the human brain directly much how you can move your arm with your mind but can not move a babys arm with your mind as it is a separate entity 
a fetus never would have never known it lived in the first place and as it were being killed it would not protest in some form against it 
adoption is very black and white with the children that are up for it 
 i concede that repetitive abortions over and over would feel wrong on a moral level but i direct you back to my original argument if any woman had the ability to sleep around without protection and solve it with an abortion every time she does not have the right to care for a child at all 
adoption is the last resort I have already explained the downfalls of this but i still feel that a forced pregnancy will do no good for anyone sure the child will experience life but life only appears to be good to us because we are alive an embryo a sperm or an egg has no desire to be born 
what then is the issue of aborting an early embryo 
killing the embryo cannot even be considering murder because the brain or nervous system has not be developed in the early stages and you have already agreed that abortion after rape is acceptable so you must not have any strong feelings on killing embryos at all 
i would find it more tragic for a child to be born and then abused than never born at all every single sperm and every single period is a tragic and wasted life by your logic 
if she did indeed want to care for the child she would not desperately want the abortion in the first place 
i am presuming that the mother will not treat the child nice because she is desperate for an abortion why would anyone who wants an abortion also want to care for the child 
I am glad your mum grew stronger from her childhood abuse and that she did not want to be aborted but you miss the point that an aborted embryo would never develop feelings or regrets 
you are promoting the child as a consequence for the woman rather than a son or daughter that the woman would love unconditionally you want to force it upon the mother and that is unfair on the child because the mother will be unlikely to offer any sincere affection 
you are answer to this is adoption which i have already rejected as a viable option although this would be great news to thousands of adoptive parents i can not see it being a straight forward procedure 
i have already stated that the life of the child would be a horrible experience in the care of a mother that never wanted them but i refuse to accept your point as anything more than a bad attempt at a counter argument because you mentioned in round one that abortions are fine in the event of rape 
she may even be spiteful that she is being forced into carrying an unwanted child for  months 
the only other argument i can foresee you mentioning is that the child could be given up for adoption directly after being born to a mother that does not care 
if the woman is as promiscuous as your initial argument makes out she may end up giving birth to many kids that she never wanted many kids that are neglected and raised in an environment of regret a home completely void of love 
although this would be great news to thousands of adoptive parents i can not see it being a straight forward procedure 
you may argue that aborting a life is equally as cruel as birthing them in an unsavoury environment but i strongly believe that an early abortion is not morally wrong in any sense because the embryo has not developed a brain or nervous system to think about or even feel what is happening 
considering my opponent was unable to make the third round we will consider this round to not count one way or another toward the winner of this debate 
thus i think under my opponents moral framework it would also be rather permissible to end the life of a fetus considering that it exists in a vegetated state 
for starters my opponent says that his argument does not hinge on potential life but i honestly do not think that that is necessarily the case 
for instance my opponent says that the act of destroying a fetus is immoral but apparently wearing a condom is completely fine 
on top of that i do not think it counts as life anymore than a sperm does especially considering that a fetus has no free will and cannot sustain itself 
finally on this subject I would like to point out that even a fetus of  months does not have a guarantee of being born 
under my opponents logic everyone should be having sexual intercourse as often as possible that way in a few months a baby would be born 
i mean if everyone who could create a baby was having intercourse then we would have a ton of babies in just about nine months 
if someone did not wear a condom during intercourse then a baby would potentially be born in a few months 
should someone not wear a condom for the same reason 
a life will thus never considered as such until at the very least after birth 
if they are unfit to become parents or would birth a child into an unhealthy environment it is inhumane to force a woman to waste the gift of life if it would only harm the future child 
if a woman comes to the difficult and emotionally straining decision to terminate a fetus hardly the size of half of a fist you must believe that is in her and the babys best interest 
if the two people were using a means of contraception or birth control that did not work they clearly were already trying to prevent this from happening and should not be punished by being forced to carry the baby 
i am not denying fetuses are living creations however the issue is abortion and how it should be womans right to terminate a pregnancy 
you have been very vague in your posting so i will refute your only standing point with the following conclusion i drew you have to look at each individual 
last thing you said having a baby is not as easy for some people 
some things should be universal such as peace but that will never happen 
but why get pregnant if you dint want the kid 
giving an unwanted birth takes a toll on a lot of people 
if you search you get over three million hits 
our daughter kaitlyn was born healthy and beautiful on march   and we love her to pieces 
if judy nicastro hadn t had her abortion the baby would have had a miserable life that probably would have ended in a painful death as hard as it was for the mother she had to make the right decision to let her baby die in very little to no pain in a warm and loving place 
once we had all the data we met with a nurse a surgeon and a pediatrician at the hospital 
i would also appreciate it if you would stop addressing me as a man because i am actually a woman but i hope this news does not like your views on a woman s right to do what she finds right with her body make you believe my female opinion is no longer valid 
i share my story in the hope that our leaders will be more responsible and compassionate when they weigh what it means to truly value the lives of women and children 
the next day at a clinic near my home i felt my son s budding life end as a doctor inserted a needle through my belly into his tiny heart 
i would like to start by saying that my english was perfectly clear just more refined and poetic than the average debate 
but to put it simpler the government doesns past present or future or what may happen if the baby is born for all they know the mother was raped the mother has a deadly illness the baby could have a horribly painful life ending in a painful death or the mother and the baby could both die if the baby is born 
and according to the law choosing to save the mother s life instead of the babys is a perfectly valid excuse for an abortion 
if you think that these questions do not matter and that all that matters to you is your life than you clearly have not yet matured enough to develop enough empathy to be able to truly understand the decision your mother has to make 
they said i needed an m r i which would provide more details 
i will tell you why it s a story the autobiography of the twenty three unbearable weeks of a loving mother 
also responding to what you said earlier that a mother cannot know what the baby wants you are partly correct the mother doesn t know what the baby would think is right which is why she needs to make the decisions for it 
and it was difficult but as the great kenneth parcel once said and like the  people out of  that commented that this story i think the mother did the right thing i hope that you can see that too 
they will not know if their mother s life could have been happier if her career could have been more fulfilling or if she could have waited longer and married someone that would have made her happier and she could have had an all around happier life and a happier family 
but although children have brain activity at about  weeks old they certainly dons best for they wondo you think your mother made the right choice by having you 
my debate partner says well i believe that it is wrong to force a child not to live 
last time i checked i would not be very happy if my mom aborted me as i would not get the chance to live and experience life 
i also dearly hope this changes your mind about what you said earlier that because really the decision should only be up to the mother 
the fact of the matter is i think its wrong to force any woman that you will never meet to do or not do anything 
i will await your opening argument and am excited for this debate 
but thye destruction of anothers life is immoral and wrongwrong is very vauge 
yet the american psychological association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion and that there was no evidence of post abortion syndrome 
adoption is not an alternative to abortion because it remains the womans choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption 
 risk of serious complications and do not affect a womans health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth 
in the case of rape or incest forcing a woman made pregnant by this violent act would because further psychological harm to the victim 
human life occurs at conception but fertilized eggs used for in vitro fertilization are also human lives and those not implanted are routinely thrown away 
as it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord its health is dependent on her health and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb 
this is definatley geting interseting however you did not have a direct link to your information your rebuttal but i managed to find it and would like to counter argue using the same source to even the playing field 
this argument will be against whether or not women should be allowed to have an abortion 
also i believe that abortion is a human right as if a person is not mentally financially prepared then that child will not have a proper upbringing in that family 
what if that woman becomes pregnant and when that child is born every time she sees that child she is reminded of the trauma she suffered 
a practice of which a man sexually penetrates a woman without consent 
so you agree that an unborn baby is an egg that never hatched 
was an egg that cracked a chicken that died or an egg that never hatched 
it appears my opponent has forfeited this round 
first off I would like to dispute the claim that an abortion is the equivalent of murder which seems to be my opponents central argument 
but one of the more compelling reasons for abortion is that it helps deter crime 
studies show that these unborn children were fifty percent more likely to live in poverty and sixty percent more likely to grow up with just one parent 
the child does not get to grow up in an environment they deserve and the family will be trapped in debt trying to pay the bills to support a baby 
second of all when you murder someone you are hurting the people who are close to this person and it leaves them traumatized 
when it is in utero it is similar to being in a deep sleep only that they have nothing to dream about and nothing to experience 
these two factors childhood poverty and a single parent household are among the strongest predictors that a child will have a criminal future 
this leads me to my next argument for abortion 
abortion does not hurt anyone this way because the parents actually want it 
however a fetus is nothing more than a ball of cells 
only in the late third trimester would the fetus even come close to looking human 
there is no point of bringing a child into this world so that it can bounce from group home to group home never knowing who its real parents are 
what about if they do not have enough money 
but what about rape 
 t said it would interfere with their education a baby should not come into the world unwanted the reason why babies are being abused and tortured and killed could revolve around the parents not wanting them 
this could give women more rights and make them be equal to men in rights viable able to survive outside the womb or after birth not a conception embryos and fetuses are not independent self determination beings so abortion is a termination of pregnancy not a baby 
so they kill them and do so by torture not justifying child abuse the mom and dad could also be neglectfull not caring about what they are doing therefore another criminal would be raised 
 of the turn aways became unemployed only  of women who got abortions were unemployed 
when it was legalized this number dropped to  unsafe abortions because   deaths worldwide each year 
women turned down an abortion are twice as likely to stay in abusive relationships and be victims of domestic violence 
the cortex does not become functional unroll the  week of pregnancy long after most abortions are performed 
should we really be forcing women who are not ready to be a mother 
these studies prove that women who were denied an abortion were clearly not ready to take on the challenge of becoming a mother 
if you begin to make it more difficult or impossible for unwed teenage mothers and other women who are not ready to become a mother to receive an abortion the government will be forced to put all of these women on welfare food stamps etc 
just to think that all of this psychological damage to the child stress on the mother and excessive government spending could have been easily prevented with an abortion 
they will likely become yet another lazy person on welfare sitting on their couch and watching tv 
by age  the unwanted children were reluctant to go to school at all and wanted to leave home as soon as possible 
one study that was done back in   in sweden compared  unwanted children to  planned children of the same sex as they grew up 
they were likely in psychiatric treatment and had a tougher time coping with stress 
there should still be a law stating that you have to have it with in so long before the baby starts to develop 
after a certain point you should not be allowed to do it 
i believe that the women holding the kid should have the right to decide if they want a abortion or not 
the swing states will be vital 
i believe my opponent has forfeited this debate 
what i believe my opponent was trying to say though was that the forced termination of human life is 
her third point is that some women will feel sad for having an abortion 
she maintains that because killing is therefore abortion is also 
who are we to expect pregnant women to voluntarily donate their body and life support systems to something else 
this is supported by the national center for health statistics own statistics 
if we can assume that preventing life to become life is in fact killing then every moment you are not engaging in the act of reproduction you are killing potential life 
but even if a fetus were a human being its still would not trump the rights of the mother 
i am pro abortion because i do not look at the specific action i look at everything as a whole 
round one forward 
contrary to the opinion of anti abortion activists falsely called as they are against the right to life of the actual human being involved a woman is not a breeding pig owned by the state or church 
a fetus does not have a right to be in the womb of any woman but is there by her permission 
there is no such thing as the right to live inside the body of another i e there is no right to enslave 
a women should be allowed to make the decision of choosing abortion or not 
sometimes life can be really harsh on us 
so are we being fair to the child 
imagine a world in which female could get access to forms of birth control that did not depend on their male sexual partners using a condom 
instead of having an abortion females will have the zygote fetus etc removed from them implanted into an artificial womb who would then be born an orphan seeking adoption 
no reason that someone who let us reason rule emotion could possibly accept 
imagine a world where instead of teaching children to just wait despite all of their emotions that play to the contrary we teach them that condoms fail more often than we would like to think 
 solutions as i said earlier any responsible debate on abortion should include solutions that both parties can agree upon 
why is our argument centered around what we will never agree upon arbitrary lines all around rather than partial solutions that are easily within reach easily agreeable by both sides and a full solution that may be within reach in our lifetimes 
with improvements to our adoption system we may be able to find homes for all such births 
after answering you have to convince the audience of why your position of valuing human is superior to my position of valuing personhood in order to win the debate 
this is the world of abstinence only education 
they believe pulling out is an excellent form of birth control failing to understand precum in the slightest 
by denying women the ability to choose when to have their children you are in fact killing the children they would otherwise have in the future 
again the anti abortion crowd for some reason seems to not accept this calling it socialism calling it the government trying to enforce responsibility on people 
the government does not force women to use this it merely empowers them with a choice they can make that many cannot currently make 
there is no reason this should not be agreed upon by both sides 
to conclude my opponent must address my challenge in  or i can give him no additional credit 
if he is responsible he will also address the potential solutions that we may both agree upon 
as a teacher who teaches children as young as  how to play classical music i submit you will be surprised at how children react when given a modicum of respect and well thought ideas 
seeing as how the majority of society in the us agrees abortions should be legal the priority for anti abortion people should be to reduce the number and to improve technology to where abortion would not be necessary not to try to ban it against the will of the people 
most people do not accept that when you masturbate have nocturnal emissions or have your period you are killing something by way of not fertilizing it 
there is no reason particularly if you accept when personhood begins to be at brain activity to deny yourself this 
in order to ban abortions entirely you have to sacrifice a lot more than most people think 
it is therefore not killing a person to kill a fetus that has not yet undergone brain waves 
if you agree with termination on the grounds of rape for mental health reasons why are the physical and mental problems associated with forced pregnancy not a problem for you 
in some years over half of the women who got abortions stated they had used some form of contraception prior to having sex 
if you draw the line at fertilization conception you have to deal with the fact that many fertilized eggs never attach to the womb 
for myself a womans bodily autonomy takes precedent prior to brain activity at the very least 
this means if we as a society improve contraception half of all abortions immediately go away to the benefit of everyone 
that means one out of every  chances you have to get pregnant will result in pregnancy 
so you think all the people who can not find a partner should never have sex 
this is more important to me than when life begins 
citing contraception as if it is foolproof and everyone who got an abortion should be ashamed is a disastrously I will informed position 
 most people who give it thought will conclude that you become a person around when brain activity begins 
not everyone wants their children to be put up for adoption 
the primary goal of anti abortion people seems to be banning abortions without taking the steps that would make it possible for pro choice people to accept that 
if you are being consistent why do you say rape 
few would call people who take their parents off life support after brain death to be murderers yet so many believe allowing a woman to terminate a pregnancy before personhood begins is killing a person 
and god does have a plan for every single baby but the likelihood of that baby becoming the person to cure aids or cancer is very unlikely simply because of the conditions that it grows up in 
while it is true that the parents could take care of the baby is it right to push the burden stimulated from your own irresponsibility onto your own parents 
also it is even more unlikely because since the mother had a pregnancy at an early age the future child might follow its mothers irresponsible actions as parents set the standards and are role models for their children 
she does not want to drop out of school when she did not even choose to be pregnant so obviously she would get an abortion 
what if an innocent women gets raped but she happens to only be  years old 
she does not want to drop out of school and have no future therefore she would get an abortion so her life would not be ruined 
yes it is possible for anyone anywhere to be a very bright and productive child but the chances are lower if a childs surroundings are worse 
the similar procedure after the fetus may be able to survive on its own is medically known as a late termination of pregnancy 
the term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy 
a staff member at your local planned parenthood health center can discuss abortion and all of your options with you and help you find the services you need 
the debate over whether or not abortion should be a legal option continues to divide americans 
abortion is the ending of pregnancy by the removal or forcing out from the womb of a fetus or embryo before it is able to survive on its own 
i not religious but he will forgive those who ask for his repentance 
we believe there are many reasons to abort such as fear of having or raising a child rape or not having enough money 
some important reasons why women should not abort have to do with human values religious values and values of conscience 
well we can discuss the issues of abortions and whether women have the right to do so without consequences for days 
these unborn babies should have the privilege to live and grow into a normal person 
with the economy as bad as it is and the population so high it will force an increase in need so they would fund more orphanages but less money 
if you got pregnant there is no other way of ensure that you will no longer be pregnant than abortion 
now i also understand the people who have been raped and ended up pregnant and cannot bear to have a child but in the instance of rape and incest proper medical care can ensure that a woman will not get pregnant 
if someone rape you and you got pregnant there is no way proper medical care can ensure you will not get pregnant you have already got pregnant 
our brain is what makes us capable of reasoning is what makes us humans in the first place 
on balance as far as it is before the development previously explained abortion is not killing a human thus it is not wrong 
by messing with a life aren 
 the thalamo cortical complex that provides consciousness with its highly elaborate content begins to be in place between the  and  week of gestation 
i mean the risk of being incapable of having a baby exists but is pretty little compared to the risk caused by other daily activities we do us alcohol tobacco and others 
what enables us to unlock the capacity of reasoning 
humans can be aware they are capable of reasoning and philosophizing 
i accept the challenge thanks for the debate 
i take it that he is against abortion in all cases because he argues in his opening statement that anyone who does abortion should be killed without giving any clarifications or exceptions 
my position on the matter therefore is that abortion should be allowed under some conditions and in some situations 
I will be explaining this further in the next rounds 
moreover a girl in dire economic conditions might not even afford to be pregnant so it does not make sense for her to give birth and then give the child away because she is too poor to support it 
i do agree that such abortion cases must not be permitted but my opponent never made it clear in the previous rounds that she is arguing against those cases 
it seems to me that my opponent shifts goalposts in every round 
does not that contradict his sentence in the opening statement which says who ever got an abortion or is for abortion should deserve to get killed 
I am with allowing the mother to perform abortion as long as the fetus is not conscious yet and the case satisfies one of those conditions  rapeit does not make sense for a mother to raise the child of her rapist 
having sex is a lot easier than taking care of a baby and the girl could have performed unsafe sex because of her immaturity to begin  not enough moneyif the baby is going to starve or suffer from malnutrition because of dire economic conditions then i do not see why the mother should keep the fertilized egg 
in addition to this it seems that he willingly ignored the part about getting pro choice supporters killed in this round 
since he did not provide a clear resolution i decided to argue against that by claiming that abortion should be allowed in some cases and that pro choice supporters should not be killed 
even if my opponent believes that abortion should be allowed only in some major cases there is still room for argument on whether abortion should be allowed in the early stages of pregnancy 
I am assuming he is against that because that represents the majority of abortion cases 
if the abortion cannot be waived or have no insuarnce a person can also realize how expensive this procedure is 
when an indivdual experience having an abortion they may feel regret or guilt but that is not something a phychologist can help with 
a person should research the many types of abortions such as induce herbs medical surgical and misscarge to decide which one is better for your health 
a woman can be too young not be emotionally prepared not have support by her significant other she can not be economically stable have health problems she could have even been raped etc 
their are many reason an individual can have to go through taking the choice of getting an abortion 
its not an easy procedure that takes alot of thinking and a woman can encounter many risks but if a woman is going through any of the following options above i belive abortion is the right option to take 
 picture this image for me a fetus or baby whatever word you would like to use with fingers toes fingernails toenails limbs etcf eatures me and you have and then the d x abortion procedure itself is rather gruesome 
thirdly your points on the origin of the word foetus was irrelevant modern day meaning and the part on dolphins was also irrelevant because i never said dolphins should be protected 
secondly if the heart does indeed form in  days then abortion is justified within  days 
 protecting human life it is the core of the argument 
remember i have to only defend certain forms of abortion you want it outlawed completley 
making the point of conception the point where human life forms is opening the way for ridiculous laws 
acog org more credible than your wikipedia sources you go on saying that my points are irrelevant although they defend my case and go against your points 
 this was in context of a mothers life versus a foetus potential life 
since no premature infants were younger than  weeks it did not determine the earliest age at which the fetus would feel pain 
the abortion practitioner instrumentally reaches into the uterus grasps the fetus feet and pulls the feet down into the cervix 
these results showed that the fetal brain can detect pain at least at  weeks of age 
 and besides i already have a link proving that up to the third trimester a foes cannot feel pain 
firstly i never advocated supporting any of the above groups and they are nto relevant to this debate so strawman 
secondly it does not matter where the word foetus comes from today it means the precursor to a baby in the womb during pregnancy 
instead of saying not to have sex because you are a minor they give out condemns and birth control 
i thank my opponent for his response con the baby inside the mothers womb is a genetically different human being than the mother so the question is how is killing a baby inside the womb or one minute out of the womb any different 
furthermore the brain does not begin to develop  weeks into pregnancy a neural groove future spinal cord forms over the notochord with a brain bulge at one end 
 con sex under the age of  is statutory rape so the rapist is the guilty one 
lastly the word fetus comes from latin roots meaning a child up to the age of eighteen 
first of all you can always deliver the baby after  weeks giving the mother and the baby a chance to live 
 pro firstly i put forward a scenario where delivering a baby would mean death for to the child and mother 
the new protocol for partial birth abortions is giving a spinal epidural so that the baby will not feel the pain and move 
if penetration of the vagina is indeed illegal if the legal age is not reached why then should it be legal for vaginal penetration to occur the other way before that age 
as per the title I am presuming my opponent is defending the notion abortion should always be illegal 
  before it can feel pain the following article and this implies that up to the development of a foetus cannot feel pain
