under the umbrella of free speech, some groups are using university campuses, like York, to undermine the fabric of civil discourse with events they have entitled “Israel Apartheid Week”.
Such events will inevitably sow discord, promote negative stereotyping and fuel hatred.
One might well ask what motivates groups like the Canadian Arab Federation, CUPE Ontario and CUPW in their endorsement and organization of “Israel Apartheid Week”.
The safety and security of Jewish students and their instructors will be unnecessarily placed in danger by these demonstrations.
The cause of peace in the Middle East will not be advanced by eroding the principles of freedom in Canadian universities.
I invite the House to join me in condemning these “Israel Apartheid Week” activities and in encouraging university administrations to take steps to stop anti-Semitism and the dissemination of hatred.
