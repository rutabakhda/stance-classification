it has really been quite a week for the Conservatives.
Eighty-six Conservative MPs, including ten cabinet ministers, voted to take away a woman's right to choose.
The Minister for the Status of Women said two years ago that she did not want to reopen the abortion debate, then she voted to do the opposite.
Listen to the comments the member for Fort McMurray—Athabasca made to his local radio show.
They reported that he said the code surrounding abortion in Canada is on par with North Korea human rights abuses.
To quote, “We're exactly at the same place as North Korea, China, and Vietnam”.
It gets worse.
Yesterday, when I asked a question about the Conservatives inviting white supremacists to committee, the Minister of State for Science and Technology started defending this group, shouting “free speech”.
Here is what makes the Conservatives uncomfortable: the NDP is in favour of women's right to choose and we do not like white supremacists.
