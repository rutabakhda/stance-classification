the Conservative government is once again trying to impose its ideological agenda on Quebec women by reopening the abortion debate.
The chair of the anti-abortion caucus introduced a bill meant to isolate women who are considering the procedure.
It is not just domestically that this government is calling into question a woman's right to choose.
While the minister responsible for CIDA is announcing her child and maternal health plan for the 10 poorest countries, we still do not know whether the organizations that offer abortion-related services will continue to be funded.
All forms of birth control, including abortion, should be funded by this plan.
The Fédération du Québec pour le planning des naissances, the Fédération des femmes du Québec and Action Canada for Population and Development are just some of the organizations that oppose these backward and ideological decisions.
The Conservative government must stop tampering with the hard-won rights of women once and for all.
